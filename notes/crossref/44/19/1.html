And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm">Acts 18:19</a></span><br />When they reached Ephesus, Paul parted ways with Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue there and reasoned with the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a></span><br />But as he left, he said, "I will come back to you again if God is willing." And he set sail from Ephesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a></span><br />After Paul had spent some time in Antioch, he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24</a></span><br />Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a></span><br />When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he greatly aided those who by grace had believed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-17.htm">Acts 19:17</a></span><br />This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear came over all of them. So the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-26.htm">Acts 19:26</a></span><br />And as you see and hear, not only in Ephesus, but in nearly the whole province of Asia, Paul has persuaded a great number of people to turn away. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a></span><br />Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, because he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18</a></span><br />When they came to him, he said, "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a></span><br />For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a></span><br />What I mean is this: Individuals among you are saying, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a></span><br />What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a></span><br />I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a></span><br />Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one man over another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a></span><br />If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain?
