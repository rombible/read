The Lord spoke to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Here I am, Lord," he answered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a></span><br />As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we got ready to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a></span><br />From there, we went to the Roman colony of Philippi, the leading city of that district of Macedonia.
