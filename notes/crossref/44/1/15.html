And the next day he got ready and went with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a></span><br />The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm">Acts 11:12</a></span><br />The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's home.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a></span><br />and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a></span><br />So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a></span><br />Peter motioned with his hand for silence, and he described how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. "Send word to James and to the brothers," he said, and he left for another place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a></span><br />But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a></span><br />Then some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a></span><br />Sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, recounting the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-2.htm">Acts 16:2</a></span><br />The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a></span><br />After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house to see the brothers and encourage them. Then they left the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a></span><br />But when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have now come here,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm">Acts 17:10</a></span><br />As soon as night had fallen, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went into the Jewish synagogue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a></span><br />The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a></span><br />Paul remained in Corinth for quite some time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a></span><br />When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he greatly aided those who by grace had believed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm">Acts 21:7</a></span><br />When we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a></span><br />When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us joyfully.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-5.htm">Acts 22:5</a></span><br />as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me.
