Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a></span><br />Then a man who lived there replied, "And who is their father?"

Now Saul was holding a spear,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm">1 Samuel 19:18</a></span><br />So David ran away and escaped.

Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-22.htm">1 Samuel 19:22</a></span><br />Finally, Saul himself left for Ramah and came to the large cistern at Secu, where he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?"
