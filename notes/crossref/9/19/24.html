Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11</a></span><br />All those who had formerly known Saul and saw him prophesying with the prophets asked one another, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a></span><br />Then a man who lived there replied, "And who is their father?" So the saying became a proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a></span><br />And to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted He had made Saul king over Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a></span><br />The next day a spirit of distress sent from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house while David played the harp as usual. Now Saul was holding a spear,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm">2 Samuel 6:20</a></span><br />As soon as David returned home to bless his own household, Saul's daughter Michal came out to meet him. "How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!" she said. "He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a></span><br />the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, "Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals from your feet." And Isaiah did so, walking around naked and barefoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a></span><br />Because of this I will lament and wail; I will walk barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and mourn like an ostrich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Chapter Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-1.htm">Elkanah, a Levite, having two wives, worships yearly at Shiloh</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-4.htm">He cherishes Hannah, though barren, and provoked by Peninnah</a></span><br><span class="reftext">9. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">Hannah in grief prays for a child</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm">Eli first rebuking her, afterwards blesses her</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm">Hannah, having born Samuel, stays at home till he is weaned</a></span><br><span class="reftext">24. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">She presents him, according to her vow, to the Lord</a></span><br><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">Clothes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-52.htm">Lay</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-24.htm">Manner</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-19.htm">Naked</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">Prophesied</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-21.htm">Prophets</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-22.htm">Samuel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">Saul</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">Stripped</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">Wherefore</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm">Clothes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-8.htm">Lay</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm">Manner</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">Naked</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-16.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm">Prophesied</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">Prophets</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">Samuel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-25.htm">Saul</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">Stripped</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-2.htm">Wherefore</a></div></div></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="combox"><div class="padcom"><div class="vheading">Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</div><p class="hdg">stripped</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14, 20</a><br />And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced with all his might before the LORD, . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a><br />the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, "Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals from your feet."
