Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a></span><br />Then the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day!
