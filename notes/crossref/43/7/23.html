Everyone who profanes it must surely be put to death. Whoever does work on that day must be cut off from his people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a></span><br />When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10</a></span><br />and a man with a withered hand was there.
