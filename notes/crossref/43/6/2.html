Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a></span><br />Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a></span><br />While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a></span><br />He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a></span><br />When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, "Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-22.htm">John 6:22</a></span><br />The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a></span><br />Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a></span><br />So they asked Him, "What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47</a></span><br />Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, "What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18</a></span><br />That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a></span><br
