This suggestion pleased the king, and he acted accordingly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8</a></span><br />When the king's command and edict had been proclaimed, many young women gathered at the citadel of Susa under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, the custodian of the women.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-9.htm">Esther 2:9</a></span><br />And the young woman pleased him and obtained his favor, so he quickly provided her with beauty treatments and the special diet.

And when it was her turn to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king's trusted official in charge of the harem, had advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a></span><br />When
