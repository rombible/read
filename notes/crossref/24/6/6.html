You must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field human, that you should besiege them?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a></span><br />But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce fruit. Use them to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a></span><br />So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: 'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow into it.

And by sword, famine, and plague, the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened, as You now see!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-31.htm">Jeremiah 32:31</a></span><br />For this city has aroused My wrath and fury from the day it was built until now.
