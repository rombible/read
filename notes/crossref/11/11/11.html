But now the LORD declares: Far be it from Me! For I will honor those who honor Me, but those who despise Me will be disdained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-12.htm">1 Kings 11:12</a></span><br />Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a></span><br />Now Solomon's servant, Jeroboam son of Nebat, was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29</a></span><br />During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem.

So the Israelites went home,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a></span><br />They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them.
