His food was locusts and wild honey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a></span><br />So Joab son of Zeruiah, along with the servants of David, marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And the two camps took up positions on opposite sides of the pool.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a></span><br />The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.

And Joab did not need to strike him again, for Amasa was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-32.htm">1 Kings 2:32</a></span><br
