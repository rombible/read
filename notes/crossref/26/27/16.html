He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a></span><br />I clothed you in embroidered cloth and provided you sandals of fine leather.
