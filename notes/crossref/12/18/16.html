So Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a></span><br />Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a></span><br />Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rab-shakeh, along with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced up to Jerusalem and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a></span><br />And Hezekiah welcomed the envoys and showed them what was in his treasure house--the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his entire armory--everything that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Chapter Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-1.htm">Hezekiah's good reign</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">He destroys idolatry, and prospers</a></span><br><span class="reftext">9. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">The inhabitants of Samaria are carried captive for their sins</a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">Sennacherib invading Judah, is pacified by a tribute</a></span><br><span class="reftext">17. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">Rabshakeh, by blasphemous persuasions, solicits the people to revolt</a></span><br><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">Asshur</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">Assyria</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm">Covered</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">Cut</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm">Door-Pillars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-5.htm">Doorposts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm">Door-Posts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">Doors</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">Gold</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">Hezekiah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">Hezeki'ah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">House</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">Judah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm">Lord's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">Overlaid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">Pillars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">Stripped</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">Temple</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm">Time</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-19.htm">Asshur</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">Assyria</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-1.htm">Covered</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-7.htm">Cut</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm">Door-Pillars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Doorposts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Door-Posts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-23.htm">Doors</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-13.htm">Gold</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">Hezekiah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-19.htm">Hezeki'ah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">House</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-22.htm">Judah</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-25.htm">Lord's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">Overlaid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-14.htm">Pillars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-9.htm">Stripped</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-1.htm">Temple</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">Time</a></div></div></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="combox"><div class="padcom"><div class="vheading">Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</div><p class="hdg">gold</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-35</a><br />For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a><br />In the first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of the LORD.</p><p class="hdg">it [heb] them </p><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/2_kings/18-16.htm</body></html>
