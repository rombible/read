Consequently, that it is not the surface of the earth, with all the things thereon, which is to be burned, as some have imagined, but the whole globe of the earth.” And that he is here speaking of these elements, and consequently of the destruction of this earth, appears still further by the promise made in the next verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved - Since this is an undoubted truth.<p>What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness - In holy conduct and piety. That is, this fact ought to be allowed to exert a deep and abiding influence on us, to induce us to lead holy lives. We should feel that there is nothing permanent on the earth that this is not our abiding home; and that our great interests are in another world. We should be serious, humble, and prayerful; and should make it our great object to be prepared for the solemn scenes through which we are soon to pass. An habitual contemplation of the truth, that all that we see is soon to pass away, would produce a most salutary effect on the mind. It would make us serious. It would repress ambition. It would lead us not to desire to accumulate what must so soon be destroyed. It would prompt us to lay up our treasures in heaven.

As regards the reading <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>, instead of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, it is indeed not supported by the preponderance of authorities; it deserves, however, the preference because it (equivalent to: “as has before been stated”) is more significant than the reading <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>. The present <span class="greekheb">λυομένων</span> is explained by Winer, p. 321 [E. T. 430]: “since all this is in its nature destined to dissolution; the lot of dissolution is, as it were, already inherent in those things” (thus also Dietlein, de Wette-Brückner, Wiesinger); but it is more correct to find expressed in the present the certainty of the event, which is, no doubt, as yet future (similarly Schott), especially as the passing away of all things, as it is formerly described, is in consequence not of their nature, but of the will of God as Judge. Hofmann denies, indeed, any reference to the future, remarking: the present participial clause brings out that this is the fate of the subject; but this fate is one which is realized only in the future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ποταποὺς δεῖ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] As regards its arrangement, this period, as far as the end of <a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a>, is divided by many into two portions, of which the first closes either with <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> (Pott, Meyer in his translation) or with <span class="greekheb">εὐσεβείαις</span> (Griesbach, Fronmüller), and forms a question to which the second half supplies the answer. But opposed to this construction is the word: <span class="greekheb">ποταπούς</span>, which in the N. T. is never used as indirect interrogation, but always in exclamation. Consequently the whole forms <span class="ital">one</span> clause, which has a hortative sense (so, too, Hofmann),[100] and before which may be supplied for the sake of clearness: “consider therefore.” The sense is: “since all that passes away, consider what manner of persons you ought to be;” Gerhard: quam pie, quam prudenter vos oportet conservari; yet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΤΑΠΌς</span></span></span> (in classical writers generally <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΔΑΠΌς</span></span></span>) is not equivalent to quantus (Bretschneider, de Wette-Brückner), but to qualis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἉΓΊΑΙς ἈΝΑΣΤΡΟΦΑῖς ΚΑῚ ΕὐΣΕΒΕΊΑΙς</span></span></span>] The plural marks the holy behaviour and the piety in their different tendencies and forms of manifestation. These words may be taken either with what precedes (so most commentators) or with what follows (thus Steinfass); the latter is to be preferred, since the force of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΤΑΠΟΎς</span></span></span> would only be weakened by this adjunct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΔΟΚῶΝΤΑς ΚΑῚ ΣΠΕΥΔΟΝΤΑς ΤῊΝ ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑΝ Τῆς ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ ἩΜΈΡΑς</span></span></span>] not: “so that,” but: “<span class="ital">since ye … in holy walk … look for</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Most of the earlier interpreters arbitrarily supply <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΕΎΔΟΝΤΑς</span></span></span>; Vulg.: exspectantes et properantes in adventum; Luther: “hasten to the day.” Others attribute to the word the meaning: “to expect with longing,” but this force it never has; in the passages quoted in support of it the word rather means: “to prosecute anything with zeal,” <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Pind. <span class="ital">Isthm.</span> v. 22: <span class="greekheb">σπεύδειν ἀρετάν</span>; <a href="/isaiah/16-5.htm" title="And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.">Isaiah 16:5</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗΝ</span></span></span>; but then the object is always something which is effected by the action of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΕΎΔΟΝΤΟς</span></span></span>; the original signification of hastening, hurrying, is to be kept hold of here.

Wherefore, beloved, with such expectations, endeavour to be found in peace, spotless and blameless. Do not reckon the long-suffering of our Lord as an opportunity for licence, but as a means of salvation, as our beloved brother Paul wrote you in the wisdom granted to him.

The Greek participle is in the present tense, and is probably used to convey the thought that even now the fabric of the earth is on its way to the final dissolution. If with some of the better MSS. we read “shall <span class="bld">thus</span> be dissolved,” instead of “then,” the participle must be taken as more definitely future, being coupled, as in that case it must be, with the manner as well as the fact of the dissolution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness</span>] It should be noted, though it cannot well be expressed in English, that both the Greek nouns are in the plural, as expressing all the manifold forms in which <span class="bld">holy living</span> (see note on <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1 Peter 1:15</a>) and “godliness” shew themselves. The verb for “be” is that which emphatically expresses a permanent and continuous state. The thought implied is that the belief in the transitoriness of all that seems most enduring upon earth should lead, as a necessary consequence, to a life resting on the eternal realities of truth and holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/3-11.htm" title="Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness,">2 Peter 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λυομένων</span>, <span class="ital">since they are being dissolved</span>) The present tense; as though it were now taking place: thus in <a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">τήκεται</span>, <span class="ital">are melting</span>.

The word for "to be" is the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which denotes original, essential, continuous being.

Both this noun and the following are plural in the Greek, and therefore mean "in all aspects and forms of holy conduct and godliness." Some commentators connect these last words, "in all holy conversation and godliness," with the next verse: "looking in all holy conversation," etc. Some, again, understand this verse as asking a question, which is answered in the next; but the Greek word for "what manner of persons" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) seems to be used in the New Testament as an exclamation only, not interrogatively. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To be dissolved (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>So Rev.
