This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Looking for - Not knowing when this may occur, the mind should be in that state which constitutes "expectation;" that is, a belief that it will occur, and a condition of mind in which we would not be taken by surprise should it happen at any moment.

The Greek word rendered "hasting," (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;  speudo&#772;,) means to urge on, to hasten; and then to hasten after anything, to await with eager desire. This is evidently the sense here - Wetstein and Robinson. The state of mind which is indicated by the word is that when we are anxiously desirous that anything should occur, and when we would hasten or accelerate it if we could. The true Christian does not dread the coming of that day. He looks forward to it as the period of his redemption, and would welcome, at any time, the return of his Lord and Saviour. While he is willing to wait as long as it shall please God for the advent of His Redeemer, yet to Him the brightest prospect in the future is that hour when he shall come to take him to Himself.<p>The coming of the day of God - Called "the day of God," because God will then be manifested in his power and glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. hasting unto&#8212;with the utmost eagerness desiring [Wahl], praying for, and contemplating, the coming Saviour as at hand. The Greek may mean "hastening (that is, urging onward [Alford]) the day of God"; not that God's eternal appointment of the time is changeable, but God appoints us as instruments of accomplishing those events which must be first before the day of God can come. By praying for His coming, furthering the preaching of the Gospel for a witness to all nations, and bringing in those whom "the long-suffering of God" waits to save, we hasten the coming of the day of God. The Greek verb is always in New Testament used as neuter (as English Version here), not active; but the Septuagint uses it actively. Christ says, "Surely I come quickly. Amen." Our part is to speed forward this consummation by praying, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus" (Re 22:20).<p>the coming&#8212;Greek, "presence" of a person: usually, of the Saviour.<p>the day of God&#8212;God has given many myriads of days to men: one shall be the great "day of God" Himself.<p>wherein&#8212;rather as Greek, "on account of (or owing to) which" day.<p>heavens&#8212;the upper and lower regions of the sky.<p>melt&#8212;Our igneous rocks show that they were once in a liquid state.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Looking for; </span> patiently waiting for, and expecting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And hasting unto; </span> by fervent desire of it, and diligent preparation for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The coming of the day of God; </span> the day of the Lord, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_peter/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,....

It is doubtful, however, whether the Greek verb for “hasten,” followed by an accusative without a preposition, can have this meaning, and its natural transitive force (as e.g. in the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/16-5.htm" title="And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.">Isaiah 16:5</a>, and Herod. i. 38) would give the sense <span class="bld">hastening the day</span>. So taken, the thought of the Apostle is that the “day of God” is not immutably fixed by a Divine decree, but may be accelerated by the readiness of His people or of mankind at large.

Here the translation "hastening" is most appropriate. The Father hath put the times and seasons in his own power; but as the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, so now he is "long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish;" and in his gracious mercy waits for the repentance of his chosen. St. Peter seems to represent Christians as "hastening the coming [literally, 'presence'] of the day of God" by working out their own salvation, and helping to spread the knowledge of the gospel (<a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>), and so rendering the long-suffering patience of God no longer necessary. The words imply also the duty of praying for that coming, as we do in the second petition of the Lord's Prayer, and in the Funeral Service, "Beseeching thee, that it may please thee, of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom." Compare St. Peter's speech in <a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3</a>, where he says, "Repent ye therefore...  that so (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>) there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ" (verses 19, 20, Revised Version). This remarkable coincidence of thought furnishes an argument of considerable weight in favour of the genuineness of this Epistle. Another possible rendering of the word is "earnestly desiring," which is adopted in the text of the Revised Version, and is preferred by some commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved.</span> The Greek for "wherein" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span>,' <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bd;</span>, on account of which, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on account of the day of God, or, what comes to much the same meaning, on account of the coming, the presence, of that day. Old things must pass away because of the coming of the day of God; the old order must give place to new. <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> The apostle repeats the striking words which he had already used in verse 10, with a different verb. The Greek word for "shall melt" here is not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in verse 10, but a stronger word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, are being melted, or wasted away. The tense is the prophetic present, implying a certain fulfillment. There is probably a reference to <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, where the Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Looking for (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>The same verb as in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-21.htm">Luke 1:21</a>, of waiting for Zacharias.

Rev., earnestly desiring, for which there is authority. I am inclined to adopt, with Alford, Huther, Salmond, and Trench, the transitive meaning, hastening on; i.e., "causing the day of the Lord to come more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which it cannot come; that day being no day inexorably fixed, but one the arrival of which it is free to the church to hasten on by faith and by prayer" (Trench, on "The Authorized Version of the New Testament"). See <a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a> : the gospel shall be preached in the whole world, "and then shall the end come." Compare the words of Peter, <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a> : "Repent and be converted," etc., "that so there may come seasons of refreshing" (so Rev., rightly); and the prayer," Thy kingdom come." Salmond quotes a rabbinical saying, "If thou keepest this precept thou hastenest the day of Messiah." This meaning is given in margin of Rev.<p>Wherein (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3b7;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Wrong. Rev., correctly, by reason of which.<p>Melt (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Literal. Stronger than the word in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>, <a href="/2_peter/3-11.htm">2 Peter 3:11</a>. Not only the resolving, but the wasting away of nature.
