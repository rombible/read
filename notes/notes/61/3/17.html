The word for “steadfastness” occurs nowhere else.<p>The entire absence of directions—which St. Jude gives rather elaborately—as to how these evil men and their victims are to be treated by sound Christians is in favour of the priority of this Epistle. When evil men begin to arise, the first impulse is to avoid them and their ways, and to this course St. Peter exhorts his readers. When such men have established themselves and gained proselytes, people begin to consider how to deal with the seducers and to win back the seduced, and to these points St. Jude directs his readers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_peter/3-17.htm" title="You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness....">2 Peter 3:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Therefore, seeing ye know these things before </span>— Respecting the coming of the Lord to judgment, in what an awful manner the scene will close, and what dreadful vengeance will be executed on all the wicked, and especially on those that pollute the Church of Christ, into which they have professed to enter; and that scoffers will arise and ridicule the promise of Christ’s coming, as also the danger there is of misunderstanding and misinterpreting the Scriptures, and so of being seduced and perverted thereby. Here St. Peter teaches that one great purpose for which the prophets were inspired to foretel the corruptions which were to arise in the church, and the evils which were to befall the sincere disciples of Christ, was to put them on their guard against these corruptions, and to arm them with fortitude to bear persecutions. <span class="ital">Beware</span> — Be on your guard; <span class="ital">lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, </span>(<span class="greekheb">αθεσμων</span>, <span class="ital">the lawless,</span>) <span class="ital">fall from your own steadfastness </span>— In the faith and practice of the gospel; that steadfastness which, by God’s assistance, you have hitherto retained. <span class="ital">But </span>— To prevent this falling away; <span class="ital">grow in grace </span>— In every Christian temper; and in order thereto, conscientiously and diligently use the means appointed. <span class="ital">And in the knowledge of Christ </span>— That is, <span class="ital">in faith, </span>the root of all piety and virtue; faith implying that knowledge of him which is communicated by <span class="ital">the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, </span>mentioned <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>, and promised <a href="/john/16-14.htm" title="He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.">John 16:14</a>. <span class="ital">To him be glory, </span><span class="greekheb">εις ημεραν αιωνος</span>, <span class="ital">to the day of eternity </span>— An expression naturally flowing from that sense which the apostle had felt in his soul throughout this whole chapter. Eternity is a day without night, without interruption, without end. <span class="ital">Amen </span>— Dr. Benson remarks, that when this word is placed at the beginning of a sentence, it is an earnest asseveration. In the conclusion of a sentence, it imports an earnest wish that it may be so. The doxology, with which this epistle concludes, is evidently directed to Christ, as are some of the other doxologies in Scripture. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seeing that ye know these things before - Being aware of this danger, and knowing that such results may follow.
