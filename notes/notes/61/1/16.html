The word for “follow,” or “follow out,” occurs again in <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Cunningly devised fables.</span>—We cannot be sure that any in particular are meant, whether heathen, Jewish, or Christian; the negative makes the statement quite general. Various things, however, have been suggested as possibly indicated—heathen mythology, Jewish theosophy, Gnostic systems (as yet quite in their infancy in Simon Magus, St. Peter’s adversary), and Apocryphal Gospels. Probably some elements in the doctrine of the false teachers are alluded to; something analogous to the “feigned words” of <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>. There is reason for believing that the particular elements in their teaching thus incidentally condemned were of <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> origin. If this conjecture be correct, then <span class= "ital">St.</span> Peter is here dealing with errors similar to those condemned by St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm" title="And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.">2Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>—the only other passages in which the word “fables” occurs). And in this case much light is thrown on some of the marked peculiarities of this Epistle and that of St. Jude, viz., the fondness of both writers for the oldest, and sometimes the most obscure, passages of Old Testament history, as well as for some strange portions of uncanonical and apocryphal tradition. They were fighting these seducers with their own weapons; difficult passages of Scripture and tradition, which these men had worked up into a system of pernicious mysticism, St. Peter and St. Jude proved to be altogether of a different meaning, and to tell against the very doctrines that they were employed to support.<p><span class= "bld">When we made known unto you.</span>—It is difficult to determine to what this refers. It is erroneous to suppose that the phrase necessarily implies personal communication by word of mouth. In the First Epistle the Apostle wrote to congregations not personally acquainted with him; and we have no reason for assuming that he had visited them since. “When we made known” may possibly refer to the First Epistle, against which supposition the plural “we” is not conclusive. Or a written Gospel—and, if so, the one with which St. Peter is commonly connected, viz., that of St. Mark—may be in the Apostle’s mind. But the simplest explanation is that he refers to the Apostolic teaching generally.<p><span class= "bld">The power and coming.</span>—The <span class= "ital">power</span> conferred upon Christ after being glorified in His passion and resurrection, and his <span class= "ital">coming</span> again to judgment. (Comp. <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm" title="For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1Corinthians 15:23</a>; &c., &c., where the same Greek word is used.) In this power He will come again. His first coming at the Incarnation would neither be the usual meaning of the word nor would suit the context.<p><span class= "bld">But were eyewitnesses.</span>—More literally, <span class= "ital">but by having been made eye-witnesses. “</span>It was not by following fables that we made known to you His power and coming, but by having been admitted eye-witnesses.” The word for “eye-witness” is sometimes a technical term for one who was admitted to the highest grade of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries. This meaning would be very applicable here; but it may be doubted whether St. Peter would be familiar with this use of the word. It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The kindred verb, “to be an eye-witness,” occurs in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-2.htm" title="While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.">1Peter 3:2</a>, and nowhere else—a coincidence worth noting. The words of another witness of the Transfiguration,” And we beheld His glory,” &c. (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), should be compared with the passage before us.<p><span class= "bld">Of his majesty.</span>—At the Transfiguration, which was a foretaste and an earnest of the glory of His second coming. This is St. Peter’s view of it; and that it is the correct one is perhaps shown by the Gospels themselves. All three accounts of the Transfiguration are preceded by the declaration, “Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom,” or similar words (<a href="/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="/luke/9-27.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:27</a>). Apparently the Transfiguration was regarded by Christ Himself as in some sense the coming of the Son of man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty....">2 Peter 1:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">For </span>— These things are worthy of being always remembered and regarded; for <span class="ital">we have not followed cunningly-devised fables </span>— Like those common among the heathen, but things infallibly true and infinitely momentous; <span class="ital">when we made known unto you the power </span>— The evidences and demonstrations which we gave of his divine power; (in the miracles which he wrought, whereby he demonstrated himself to be the Son of God;) <span class="ital">and coming of our Lord Jesus </span>— Namely, that the promised Messiah was already come, and that Jesus of Nazareth was he. Or his second coming to raise the dead, to judge mankind, and to introduce his people into his eternal kingdom, might be chiefly intended. But it may be observed, if what the apostles have advanced concerning Christ had not been true, if it had been only of their own invention, then, to have imposed such a lie on the world, as it was in the very nature of things above all human power to defend, and to have done this at the expense of life and all things, only to engage the whole world, Jews and Gentiles, against them, would not have been <span class="ital">cunning, </span>but the greatest folly that men could have been guilty of. <span class="ital">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty </span>— At his transfiguration, which was a specimen of his glory at the last day. <span class="ital">For he received from God the Father </span>divine <span class="ital">honour and </span>inexpressible <span class="ital">glory </span>— Shining from heaven above the brightness of the sun; <span class="ital">when there came such a voice from the excellent glory </span>— From the Shechinah, as the Jews termed that glorious appearance which was a symbol of the presence of Jehovah; <span class="ital">This is my beloved Son, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="/context/matthew/17-2.htm" title="And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light....">Matthew 17:2-5</a>. <span class="ital">This voice we heard </span>— Namely, Peter, James, and John.

The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables - That is, fictions or stories invented by artful men, and resting on no solid foundation. The doctrines which they held about the coming of the Saviour were not, like many of the opinions of the Greeks, defended by weak and sophistical reasoning, but were based on solid evidence - evidence furnished by the personal observation of competent witnesses. It is true of the gospel, in general, that it is not founded on cunningly devised fables; but the particular point referred to here is the promised coming of the Saviour. The evidence of that fact Peter proposes now to adduce.<p>When we made known unto you - Probably Peter here refers particularly to statements respecting the coming of the Saviour in his first epistle, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>; but this was a common topic in the preaching, and in the epistles, of the apostles. It may, therefore, have referred to statements made to them at some time in his preaching, as well as to what he said in his former epistle. The apostles laid great stress on the second coming of the Saviour, and often dwelt upon it. Compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; Notes, <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.<p>The power and coming - These two words refer to the same thing; and the meaning is, his "powerful coming," or his "coming in power." The advent of the Saviour is commonly represented as connected with the exhibition of power. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, "coming in the clouds of heaven, with power." See the notes at that verse. Compare <a href="/luke/22-69.htm">Luke 22:69</a>; <a href="/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9</a>. The "power" evinced will be by raising the dead; summoning the world to judgment; determining the destiny of men, etc. When the coming of the Saviour, therefore, was referred to by the apostles in their preaching, it was probably always in connection with the declaration that it would be accompanied by exhibitions of great power and glory - as it undoubtedly will be. The fact that the Lord Jesus would thus return, it is clear, had been denied by some among those to whom this epistle was addressed, and it was important to state the evidence on which it was to be believed. The grounds on which they denied it <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a> were, that there were no appearances of his approach; that the premise had not been fulfilled; that all things continued as they had been; and that the affairs of the world moved on as they always had done. To meet and counteract this error - an error which so prevailed that many were in danger of "falling from their own steadfastness" <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a> - Peter states the proof on which he believed in the coming of the Saviour.<p>But were eye-witnesses of his majesty - On the mount of transfiguration, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>. See the notes at that passage. That transfiguration was witnessed only by Peter, James, and John. But it may be asked, how the facts there witnessed demonstrate the point under consideration - that the Lord Jesus will come with power? To this it may be replied:<p>(1) that these apostles had there such a view of the Saviour in his glory as to convince them beyond doubt that he was the Messiah.<p>(2) that there was a direct attestation given to that fact by a voice from heaven, declaring that he was the beloved Son of God.<p>(3) that that transfiguration was understood to have an important reference to the coming of the Saviour in his kingdom and his glory, and was designed to be a representation of the manner in which he would then appear. This is referred to distinctly by each one of the three evangelists who have mentioned the transfiguration. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>, "there be some standing here which shall not taste of death until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom;" <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm">Mark 9:1-2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27-28</a>. The transfiguration which occurred soon after these words were spoken was designed to show them what he would be in his glory, and to furnish to them a demonstration which they could never forget, that he would yet set up his kingdom in the world.<p>(4) they had in fact such a view of him as he would be in his kingdom, that they could entertain no doubt on the point; and the fact, as it impressed their own minds, they made known to others. The evidence as it lay in Peter's mind was, that that transfiguration was designed to furnish proof to them that the Messiah would certainly appear in glory, and to give them a view of him as coming to reign which would never fade from their memory. As that had not yet been accomplished, he maintained that the evidence was clear that it must occur at some future time. As the transfiguration was with reference to his coming in his kingdom, it was proper for Peter to use it with that reference, or as bearing on that point. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Now in order to set forth the nature, excellency, and certainty of the doctrine the apostle taught, especially that part of it which respected the coming of Christ; and to show that it was worth his while to put them in mind of it, and theirs to remember it; he observes, that he and his fellow apostles did not proceed in their account of it on such a foundation, but upon an evidence which they had received, both with their eyes and ears, and also on a word of prophecy surer than that: <p>when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; not his first coming, though that, and the benefits arising from it, were the subject of their ministry; and that was attended with divine power, which appeared in the incarnation of Christ itself, which was owing to the power of the Highest; and was seen in his doctrine and ministry, which were with great authority; and in the miracles which he wrought, which proved him to have power equal with God, his Father; and in the work of redemption, which he came about and finished; in doing which he made an end of sin, and saved his people from it, redeemed them from the curse of the law, overcame the world, destroyed Satan, and abolished death; and especially in his resurrection from the dead, when he was declared to be the Son of God with power: but notwithstanding his first coming was in great humility, in much meanness and imbecility, he grew up as a tender plant, and was encompassed with infirmities, and at last was crucified through weakness. This therefore was to be understood of an after coming of his, which the apostle had wrote of, and made known in his former epistle, <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a> and which he puts them in mind of in this, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>, nor is the word  used of any other coming of Christ, and this will be with power; and it designs his more near coming to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, and deliver his people from the afflictions and persecution they laboured under, and which was with great power; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3</a>, or more remote, namely, at the last day, when there will be a great display of power in raising the dead, gathering all nations before him, separating them one from another, passing the final sentence on each, and executing the same in the utter destruction of the wicked, and the complete glorification of the saints. <p>But were eyewitnesses of his majesty; meaning, not of the glory of his divine nature by faith, and with the eyes of their understanding, while others only considered him as a mere man; nor of the miracles he wrought, in which there was a display of his glory and majesty, of all which the apostles were eyewitnesses; but of that glory and greatness which were upon him, when he was transfigured on the mount before them; then his face was as the sun, and such a glory on his whole body, that it darted through his clothes, and made them glitter like light, and as white as snow, and so as no fuller on earth could whiten them; at which time also Moses and Elijah appeared in glorious forms: and now this was a prelude and pledge of his power and coming, of his kingdom coming with power, and of his coming in his own, and his Father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels. This was a proof that notwithstanding his meanness in his incarnate state, yet he was glorified, and would be glorified again; and this was a confirmation of it to the apostles, and might be to others: see <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span><p>(10) Another amplification taken from both the great certainty and also the excellency of his doctrine, of which our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God is author, whose glory the apostle both saw and heard.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2 Peter 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ σεσοφισμένοις μύθοις ἐξακολουθήσαντες</span>] <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> shows that this verse, in which allusion is made to the erroneous teachers, gives the reason for the <span class="greekheb">σπουδάσω</span>.

The interpretation of Aretius is, on the other hand, incorrect: fabulae falsam habentes sapientiae et veritatis speciem. The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῦΘΟΙ</span></span></span> is to be found in the N. T. only here and in the Pastoral Epistles. As the author makes no special allusion of the kind, it is at least doubtful if he refers to any <span class="ital">definite</span> myths; either those of the heathen with reference to the appearances of the gods upon earth (Oecumenius, Estius, Bengel, etc.), or to those of the Gnostics as to the emanation of the aeons (Dietlein), or to the Gnostic myth of the <span class="ital">Sophia</span> (Baur), or to the apocryphal legends of the birth and childhood of Christ, especially in the <span class="ital">Ev. Infantiae Jesu</span> (Jachmann), or to false myths as to Christ embellished in the spirit of the Jewish Messianic beliefs (Semler), or “apocryphal, didactic, and historical traditions, as these were appended by a later Judaism to the histories of the O. T., especially to the most ancient” (Schott, similarly Steinfass), or to the practice of heathen lawgivers, who, according to Josephus, appropriated to themselves the fables of popular belief, borrowing from them their accounts of the gods (Hofmann). The words express, indeed, an antithesis, but this is of an entirely general kind; either in order to bring out that the apostolic preachers are not like those others who seek the support of myths,—perhaps with special reference to the false teachers alluded to in chap. 2 and 3,—or, what is less probable, in order to meet the reproaches of these teachers (Wiesinger), and the contrast serves to give the more prominence to the positive statement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξακολουθήσαντες</span>] The verb, besides here, only in chap. <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2 Peter 2:15</a>. The preposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞ</span></span></span> does not precisely indicate the error (Bengel), but only the going forth from a particular point; in common usage, however, this secondary meaning often entirely recedes; cf. the passage below, quoted from Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant</span>. prooem. § 4. By this negative statement the author denies not only that his message was based on myths, but that in it he followed a communication received from others (Schott).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγνωρίσαμεν ὑμῖν τὴν τοῦ κυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δύναμιν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρουσίαν</span>] Several interpreters understand this of the First Epistle of Peter; in which case the plural is surprising, for the author had already spoken of himself in the singular. Hofmann’s objection to this view is, that although in his former epistle Peter refers to the power and coming of Christ, he did not first make it known to the readers. But the passages <a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1 Corinthians 15:1</a> and <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm" title="But I certify you, brothers, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.">Galatians 1:11</a>, show that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝΩΡΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> may also be used of a proclamation, the substance of which had already been communicated to those to whom it was made. Many commentators take the words as referring to the whole preaching of the apostles, understanding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, not of the readers specially, but of the Gentile-Christians generally; thus Wiesinger, and more decidedly Hofmann. It must be observed, however, in opposition to this, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΕΝΗΘΈΝΤΕς</span></span></span> and the subsequent <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς ἨΚΟΎΣΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span> must refer to the same subject as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΝΩΡΊΣΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>. The most probable explanation is, that the author, remembering that he was not the only witness of the transfiguration, passed from the singular to the plural, and in so doing made use of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span> in its extended sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> is not here the <span class="ital">nativitas Christi</span>, His human birth (Vatablus, Erasmus, Hornejus, Pott, Jachmann, etc.), nor “His presence during the time He appeared on earth” (Schmid); but, in harmony both with the N. T. usage (chap. <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm" title="For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.) and the connection of thought (<a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2 Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>): the return of Christ to judgment (Estius, Semler, Knapp, Dietlein, de Wette-Brückner, Hofmann, and the more modern interpreters generally[49]). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΎΝΑΜΙς</span></span></span>, however, denotes the fulness of might of the glorified Lord, as it will be more especially revealed in His <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span>. It is not correct to combine both ideas into one, and with Hornejus to explain: potens adventus; or with Bengel: majestas praesentissima.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ἘΠΌΠΤΑΙ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΜΕΓΑΛΕΙΌΤΗΤΟς</span></span></span>] An antithesis, affirmatively stated, to what goes before. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΌΠΤΗς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἍΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΛΕΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-2.htm" title="While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.">1 Peter 3:2</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΟΠΤΕΎΩ</span></span></span>), is the term, techn. for him who had reached the highest degree of initiation into the Eleusinian mysteries. Keeping to this, Bengel here interprets: ad intima arcana admissi; de Wette, too, thinks that the expression has here the secondary meaning of being initiated, of intimacy. It is no doubt chosen purposely with reference to the fact that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΓΑΛΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> of Christ, which Peter and the other two disciples beheld, was a mystery hidden from the others. Grotius, Pott, and others take it as synonymous with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΌΠΤΗς</span></span></span>, <a href="/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>. The connection demands that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΌΠΤΑΙ ΓΕΝΗΘΈΝΤΕς</span></span></span> should be referred to the fact of the transfiguration (<a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a>). Hofmann is wrong in supposing that Peter here thought of the appearance of the Risen One and His ascension. The assertion is refuted not only by the close connection in which <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a> stands to this verse, but by the word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΓΑΛΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, which in no sense is expressive only of “<span class="ital">greatness</span>.” As the form in which Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after His resurrection was the same as that in which they had seen Him before it, they were not then in any way <span class="greekheb">ἐπόπται</span> of his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΓΑΛΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>; nor is there the slightest hint that there is here allusion to any fact other than that mentioned in the following verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ἘΚΕΊΝΟΥ ΜΕΓΑΛΕΙΌΤΗΤΟς</span></span></span>] that is, the glory in which at His transfiguration Christ showed Himself to the three disciples. Incorrectly Calvin: exemplum unum prae aliis eligit memorabile, in quo Christus coelesti gloria ornatus conspicuam divinae magnificentiae speciem tribus discipulis praebuit. The apostle rather regards the transfiguration glory of Christ as the type—and therefore the proof—of the glory of Christ at His <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] Dietlein thinks that the expression <span class="greekheb">σεσοφισμένοις</span> contains a double reproach, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> not only by the termination <span class="greekheb">ιζειν</span>, but also in as far as the word <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> means what is bad; however, the termination <span class="greekheb">ιζειν</span> is by no means always used in a bad sense, nor does <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> in itself mean what is bad, except only in connection with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρωπίνη</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>), etc. Besides, <span class="greekheb">σοφίζειν</span> is mostly employed so as to contain the secondary meaning of cleverness (see Pape, <span class="ital">e.v</span>.); consequently Hofmann is wrong in rendering <span class="greekheb">σεσοφισμένος</span> simply by “<span class="ital">conceived</span>,” asserting that the word means nothing else. Cf. with our passage Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. prooem. 4: <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι νομοθέται τοῖς μύθοις ἐξακολουθήσαντες τῶς ἀνθρωπίνων ἁμαρτημάτων εἰς τοὺς θεοὺς τῷ λόγῳ τὴν αἰσχύνην μετέθησαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[49] Fronmüller only interprets: “His appearing with miraculous powers in the flesh, along with His expected appearance in glory.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty....">2 Peter 1:16-18</a>. <span class="ital">The fact of the Transfiguration a guarantee of the writer’s truthfulness</span>. “For we are not without facts to rest upon.

For He received from God the Father honour and glory, a voice coming to Him through the splendour of the glory, ‘This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased’. This voice we heard, as it was borne from heaven, when we were with Him in the Holy Mount.” (For a comparison of this passage, with the Synoptic account, see Introduction, pp. 94 ff.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you</span> …] More accurately, <span class="bld">For it was not as following cunningly devised fables that we made known</span>—the connexion being one not of time but of causation. The “fables” or “myths” referred to are probably those of which St Paul speaks in the Pastoral Epistles (<a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm" title="But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm" title="And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.">2 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>), which were, as the description there given of them indicates, mainly of Jewish origin. With these there might be mingled the germs of the Gnosticism incipient in the Apostolic age, and developed more fully in the next century. Possibly there may be an allusive reference to the claims of the sorcerer of Samaria, with whom the Apostle had himself come into collision (<a href="/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>). The boast of Simon that he was the “great power of God,” and that his mistress Helena was the incarnation of the Divine Thought or Wisdom by which the worlds were made, would answer, closely enough, to the “cunningly devised fables” of which St Peter speaks. The word for “cunningly devised,” framed, i.e., with fraudulent and sophistical purpose, is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. The question what the Apostle refers to in “we made known to you:” it may refer either to unrecorded teaching addressed to the Asiatic Churches, or to the wider circle of readers defined in <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a>, or, more probably, to the teaching of the First Epistle as to the glory that was to be manifested “at the appearing of Jesus Christ” (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>). The tone in which the offensive epithet is used suggests the thought that he is defending himself against a charge of having followed “fables.” Is it possible that that charge had been brought against his teaching as to “the spirits in prison,” as something superadded to the received oral traditions of the Church, or to the written records, whether identical with our present Gospels or not, in which that teaching had been embodied?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>] The “coming,” here, as in every other passage of the New Testament in which the word occurs, is the Second Advent, not the first. The mind of the Apostle goes back to what he had witnessed in the glory of the Transfiguration, as the pledge and earnest of that which was afterwards to be revealed. The word does not occur in the First Epistle, but the fact is implied in <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1 Peter 5:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but were eyewitnesses of his majesty</span>] Both words are significant. That for “eye-witnesses” (not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but used of God as the all-seeing in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-35.htm" title="For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.">2Ma 7:35</a>; 3Ma 2:21) was applied in Classical Greek to the highest order of those who were initiated as spectators of the Eleusinian mysteries. It would, perhaps, be too much to say that that association was definitely present to the Apostle’s mind, but the choice of an unusual and suggestive word at least implies that he looked on himself as having been chosen to a special privilege. It deserves notice also, as bearing on the authorship of the Epistle, that the verb derived from the noun had been used by the writer of <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-2.htm" title="While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.">1 Peter 3:2</a>. (See notes there.) The word for “majesty” also has the interest of having been used in the Gospel narrative in close connexion with the healing of the demoniac boy which followed the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-43.htm" title="And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,">Luke 9:43</a>), and, as found there, may fairly be taken as including, as far as the three disciples who had seen the vision of glory were concerned, what had preceded that work of healing, as well as the work itself. The only other passage in the New Testament in which it is found is in <a href="/acts/19-27.htm" title="So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nothing; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.">Acts 19:27</a>, where it is used of the “magnificence” of the Ephesian Artemis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2 Peter 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) He shows that the subject was one, respecting which it was befitting that he should write, though even on the point of death; alleging the testimony of apostles, and the discourse of prophets.—<span class="greekheb">σεσοφισμένοις</span>) <span class="greekheb">πλαστοῖς</span>, ch. <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2 Peter 2:3</a>, <span class="ital">cunningly devised</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μύθοις</span>) <span class="ital">fables</span>, such as the heathen had respecting their gods.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξακολουθησαντες</span>) The <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> denotes error; ch. <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2 Peter 2:15</a>. There is no such error in this matter.—<span class="greekheb">δύναμιν καὶ παρουσίαν</span>, <span class="ital">the power and presence</span>) Hendiadys: that is, most present majesty. <span class="greekheb">Δύναμις</span>, <span class="ital">power</span>, is opposed to <span class="ital">fables</span>. Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>, where <span class="ital">word</span> and <span class="ital">power</span> are opposed to each other. The Transfiguration on the Mount is a pattern of the revelation of glory at the last day; and the whole testimony of the apostles looks to this revelation: <a href="/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπόπται</span>, <span class="ital">eye-witnesses</span>) Admitted to His innermost secrets; for instance, on the Mount.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκείνου</span>, <span class="ital">of Him</span>) <span class="greekheb">Ἐκεῖνος</span>, <span class="ital">He</span>, denotes something distant, and wonderful, and great.—<span class="greekheb">μεγαλειότητος</span>, <span class="ital">majesty</span>) As the name of <span class="ital">the Father</span> and <span class="ital">the Son</span> are correlative terms, so are <span class="ital">magnificent glory</span> and <span class="ital">majesty. Magnificent glory</span> in the text is ascribed to the Father; <span class="ital">majesty</span> (magnitudo) or <span class="greekheb">μεγαλειότης</span> (for the Greek word differs somewhat from the Latin), to the Son.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables;</span> rather, <span class="accented">did not follow.</span> The participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is aorist. This compound verb is used only by St. Peter in the New Testament; we find it again in <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a> and 15. Bengel and others have thought that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, from or out of, implies wandering from the truth after false guides; but probably the word merely means "to follow closely," though in this case the guides were going astray. Perhaps the use of the plural number is accounted for by the fact that St. Peter was not the only witness of the glory of the Transfiguration; he associates in thought his two brother-apostles with himself. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, fables, with this exception, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles. There is a remarkable parallel in the procemium of the 'Antiquities' of Josephus, sect. 4, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter may be referring to the "Jewish fables" mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>), or to the stories about the heathen gods such as those in Hesiod and Ovid, or possibly to some early inventions, such as those ascribed to Simon the Sorcerer, which were afterwards to be developed into the strange fictions of Gnosticism (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>). The word rendered "cunningly devised" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; but there a different part of the verb is used, and in a different sense. <span class="cmt_word">When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter can scarcely be referring to St. Paul or other missionaries, as the following words identify the preachers with the witnesses of the Transfiguration; he must be alluding either to his First Epistle (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>), or to personal teaching of his which has not been recorded, or, just possibly, to the Gospel of St. Mark. St. Peter had seen the power of the Lord Jesus manifested in his miracles; he had heard the announcement  of the risen Saviour, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" he had, like the rest of the apostles, been "endued with power from on high." By the coming (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) he must mean the second advent, the invariable meaning of the word in Holy Scripture (see chapter 2 Peter 3:4, <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> The word for "eye-witnesses" is not the common one (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, used by St. <a href="/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>), but a technical word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which in classical Greek designates the highest class of those who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. The choice of such a word may possibly imply that St. Peter regarded himself and his brother-apostles as having received the highest initiation into the mysteries of religion. The noun is found only here in the New Testament; but the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a> and 1 Pet 3:2, and in no other of the New Testament writers. Here again we have an undesigned coincidence which points to identity of authorship. The word for "majesty" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in St. Luke's description of the healing of the demoniac boy immediately after the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>), and elsewhere only in <a href="/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We have not followed (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>A strong compound, used only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>.
