Tyndale and the Rhemish version have “in.”“ Knowledge” is not quite strong enough. In the original we have a compound word, which implies fuller, riper, more minute knowledge. But any of these expressions would be a little too strong, as the simple word is a little too weak. The same compound recurs <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>. It is rare in St. Paul’s earlier letters, but is more common in the later ones. This fact, coupled with its appearance here, agrees well with the more contemplative aspect in which the Gospel began gradually to be presented; a change which finds its fullest expression in the transition from the first three Gospels to the fourth. The word is introduced here with telling emphasis; “in the fuller knowledge of God” anticipates the attack that is coming upon the godless speculations of the “false teachers” in 2 Peter 2.<p><span class= "bld">And of Jesus our Lord.</span>—Deliberately added. These false teachers “denied the Lord that bought them” (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>), and promised all kinds of high-sounding benefits to their followers (<a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>). The Apostle assures his readers that only in fuller knowledge of their Lord can grace and peace be multiplied to them. The combination “Jesus our Lord” is unusual; elsewhere only <a href="/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a>.

Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord - That is, grace and peace abound to us, or may be expected to be conferred on us abundantly, if we have a true knowledge of God and of the Saviour.

Still the prominent object of Peter's exhortation is "the knowledge of Jesus our Lord" (a phrase only in Ro 4:24), and, only secondarily, of the Father through Him (2Pe 1:8; 2Pe 2:20; 3:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Through the knowledge of God; </span> or acknowledgment, i.e. faith, whereby we are made partakers of all the saving graces of the Spirit; and whereby being justified, we are at peace with God, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And of Jesus our Lord; </span> there being no saving knowledge of God, or faith in him, but by Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_peter/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you,.... By a multiplication of grace may be meant a larger discovery of the love and favour of God; which though it admits of no degrees in itself, being never more or less in God's heart, yet, as to the manifestations of it, it is different, and capable of being increased, and drawn out to a greater length; or else an increase of the internal graces of the Spirit of God, as to the actings and exercise of them; or a larger measure of the gifts of the Spirit, for greater usefulness among them; or a clearer view, and a more enlarged knowledge of the Gospel of the grace of God, and the truths of it; and indeed, the word grace may take in all these senses: and by a multiplication of peace, which the apostle in this salutation also wishes for, may be designed an affluence of all kind of prosperity, temporal, and spiritual, external and internal; and more especially an increase of spiritual peace, a fulness of joy and peace in believing, arising from a sense of free justification by Christ's righteousness, and full pardon and atonement by his blood and sacrifice: <p>through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; which is to be understood, not of a natural, but of a spiritual and evangelical knowledge; of a knowledge of God, not as the God of nature and providence, but as the God of all grace, as in Christ, and a covenant God in him, and of the person, offices, and grace of Christ; and which designs true faith in him, by which means larger discoveries of the grace of God are made, and a greater enjoyment of spiritual peace is had: or it may be rendered, "with the knowledge of God", &amp;c. and the sense then is, that the apostle prays, as for a multiplication of grace and peace, so along with it, an increase of spiritual and evangelical knowledge; which in the best is imperfect, but may be increased by the blessing of God on those means which he has appointed for that end, such as the word and ordinances. The Syriac version renders this clause, "through the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ", leaving out the word "God", and the copulative "and", and adding the word "Christ"; and the Ethiopic version reads, "in the knowledge of our God, Christ Jesus our Lord", without any distinction. After the inscription and salutation begins the epistle, with an account of various special favours bestowed upon these persons; and are mentioned by the apostle to encourage his faith and theirs, in expectation of enjoying what he here wishes unto them, since already such great and good things had been bestowed upon them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</span><p>(2) Faith is the acknowledging of God and Christ, from which all our blessedness issues and flows.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2 Peter 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> … <span class="greekheb">πληθυνθείη</span>.: the same form of salutation as in <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν</span>.

It does not occur in the First Epistle. In St Paul’s Epistles it meets us first in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>, and occurs more or less frequently in most of the subsequent Epistles. In <a href="/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a> the verb from which it is formed is contrasted with the less perfect knowledge expressed by <span class="ital">gnosis</span>. Looking to the history of the words, it would seem probable that in proportion as rash and self-asserting teaching boasted of the higher <span class="ital">gnosis</span>, the “science, falsely so called,” of <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1 Timothy 6:20</a>, which afterwards developed into the heresies of the <span class="ital">Gnostic</span> sect, the true teachers set up the other word as expressing something nobler and more excellent. “Not <span class="ital">gnosis</span>,” they seem to say, “but <span class="ital">epignosis</span>, not an abstract speculative knowledge, but that which implies a fulness of contemplation, loving as well as knowing.” St Peter’s use of the word in this Epistle, obviously written after closer contact with false teachers of this kind than is traceable in the First, admits, probably, of this explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jesus our Lord</span>] The peculiar construction, as distinct from “Christ Jesus” and “the Lord Jesus,” occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2 Peter 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">through the knowledge of our Lord</span>) This short and simple reading seems to have been the original reading both of the <span class="ital">Latin</span> translator, and a little previously of the apostle himself. For this Epistle presupposes <span class="ital">the knowledge of God</span>; <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>; but it particularly urges <span class="ital">the knowledge of our Lord</span>, namely, <span class="ital">Jesus Christ</span>; <a href="/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2 Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

The exact correspondence should be noticed. The writer of the Second Epistle, if not St. Peter himself, must have been attempting to imitate of set purpose the opening salutation of the First Epistle. Through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; rather, <span class="accented">in the knowledge.</span> The knowledge of God is the sphere in which grace and peace are communicated to the soul; they cannot be found outside that sphere. "Full knowledge" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may be regarded as the key-note of this Epistle, as "hope" is of the first. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; it means "knowledge" directed towards an object, gradually approaching nearer and nearer to it, concentrated upon it, fixed closely upon it. So it comes to mean the knowledge, not merely of intellectual apprehension, but rather of deep contemplation; the knowledge which implies love - for only love can concentrate continually the powers of the soul in close meditation upon its object. Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, where, after saying in verse 8 that "knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) shall be done away," St. Paul continues, in verse 12, "Now I know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>) in part, but then I shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) even as also I am known (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)." He contrasts our present imperfect knowledge with the full knowledge which the blessed will have in heaven, and which God now has of us, using the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> of that fuller knowledge, as he had used <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the imperfect knowledge. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs several times in the Gospels, and is common in St. Paul's Epistles; it seems to imply a sort of protest against the knowledge that "puffeth up" (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>), and especially against the knowledge "falsely so called" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>), which was claimed by the false teachers, who were the precursors of the coming Gnosticism (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). St. Peter had learned mere of the doings of these false teachers since he wrote the First Epistle, and this may perhaps be a reason for his frequent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the second.
