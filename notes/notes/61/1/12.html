The body is but a tabernacle, or tent, of the soul. It is a mean and movable dwelling. The nearness of death makes the apostle diligent in the business of life. Nothing can so give composure in the prospect, or in the hour, of death, as to know that we have faithfully and simply followed the Lord Jesus, and sought his glory. Those who fear the Lord, talk of his loving-kindness. This is the way to spread the knowledge of the Lord; and by the written word, they are enabled to do this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore I will not be negligent - That is, in view of the importance of these things.<p>To put you always in remembrance - To give you the means of having them always in remembrance; to wit, by his writings.<p>Though ye know them - It was of importance for Peter, as it is for ministers of the gospel now, to bring known truths to remembrance. Men are liable to forget them, and they do not exert the influence over them which they ought. It is the office of the ministry not only to impart to a people truths which they did not know before, but a large part of their work is to bring to recollection well-known truths. and to seek that they may exert a proper influence on the life. Amidst the cares, the business, the amusements, and the temptations of the world, even true Christians are prone to forget them; and the ministers of the gospel render them an essential service, even if they should do nothing more than remind them of truths which are well understood, and which they have known before. A pastor, in order to be useful, need not always aim at originality, or deem it necessary always to present truths which have never been heard of before. He renders an essential service to mankind who "reminds" them of what they know but are prone to forget, and who endeavors to impress plain and familiar truths on the heart and conscience, for these truths are most important for man.<p>And be established in the present truth - That is, the truth which is with you, or which you have received - Robinson's Lexicon on the word &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  pareimi. The apostle did not doubt that they were now confirmed in the truth as far as it had been made known to them, but he felt that amidst their trials, and especially as they were liable to be drawn away by false teachers, there was need of reminding them of the grounds on which the truths which they had embraced rested, and of adding his own testimony to confirm their Divine origin. Though we may be very firm in our belief of the truth, yet there is a propriety that the grounds of our faith should be stated to us frequently, that they may be always in our remembrance. The mere fact that at present we are firm in the belief of the truth, is no certain evidence that we shall always continue to be; nor because we are thus firm should we deem it improper for our religious teachers to state the grounds on which our faith rests, or to guard us against the arts of those who would attempt to subvert our faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The apostle having made use of proper arguments to excite the saints he writes to regard the exhortation he had given, to the diligent exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, proceeds to give the reasons of his own conduct, why he gave such an exhortation to them, and pressed it, and continued to do so, and determined for the future to go on with it, as particularly the usefulness and profitableness of it; and therefore, seeing it would be attended with so many advantages before mentioned, he was resolved that he would not be careless, nor omit any opportunity that should offer: <p>to put you always in remembrance of these things; of the exercise of the above graces, and the performance of the above duties, which saints are too apt to forget, and therefore should be reminded of; and it is the duty and business of the ministers of the word frequently to inculcate those things: <p>though ye know them, and be established in the present truth; for those that know the most, know but in part; and may have their knowledge increased; and those that are the most established in the truths of the Gospel, may be confirmed yet more and more. This the apostle mentions as an apology for himself, and to prevent an objection that might be made, as if he had suggested that they were ignorant and unstable; or which might insinuate that there was no necessity of such frequent putting in remembrance; since they were both knowing and stable: by "the present truth" may be meant, either the whole scheme of the Gospel, which was now come by Christ, in opposition to the exhibition of it under the former dispensation, by promise and type; and it being so called, shows that it is always now, and new; that there will be no alteration in it, nor addition to it, it being like the author of it, the same yesterday, today, and for ever, and will not give place to another scheme of things; or else the particular truth of the coming of Christ, either to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, or to judge the world in righteousness, and introduce his own people into the new heavens, and new earth, <a href="/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <i>them</i>, and be established in the present truth.</span><p>(9) An amplifying of the conclusion joined with a modest excuse, in which he declares his love towards them, and tells them of his death which is at hand.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm" title="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2 Peter 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">διό</span>] not: “therefore, because the <span class="ital">whole</span> duty consists precisely in the not forgetting” (Dietlein), for no expression was given to any such thought here, but: because to him alone,[43] who in the supplying of virtues reaches an ever more complete knowledge of Christ, is an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of Christ ministered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μελλήσω</span>] The same form elsewhere only in <a href="/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6</a>; de Wette interprets it here: “I will <span class="ital">ever have a care</span>;” Schott translates: “I will always be in the position;” but there is nothing which renders necessary here a translation different from that in the other passage.

And thus Peter says, <span class="ital">I will regard you as always</span> (needing) <span class="ital">to be admonished</span>: I will never think how much I have admonished you; I will think this only, that you ought to be admonished by me. The present, <span class="greekheb">μέλλω</span>, conveys the notion of a future action; wherefore <span class="greekheb">μελλήσω</span> is an accumulated future; <span class="ital">I shall be about to admonish</span>. Hesychius, <span class="greekheb">μελλήσω</span>, <span class="greekheb">σπουδάσω</span>, <span class="ital">I will earnestly endeavour</span>. And this very synonym, <span class="greekheb">σπουδάσω</span>, follows shortly after in <a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2 Peter 1:15</a>, where the <span class="ital">earnestness</span> (<span class="greekheb">σπουδὴ</span>) of the apostle is also to be observed extending itself <span class="ital">by letters</span> even beyond (after) his decease; and thence the appropriate use of the word <span class="greekheb">μνήμη</span> (memory), with reference to his death. Ammonius, <span class="greekheb">Μνήμη μὲν γίνεται νεκροῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">μνεία δὲ ζῶντος</span>. <span class="greekheb">μνήμη</span> is said <span class="ital">with reference to the dead</span>, and <span class="greekheb">μνεία</span>, <span class="ital">with reference to the living</span>. See <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm" title="There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>, etc., Septuagint.—<span class="greekheb">ἀεὶ</span>, <span class="ital">always</span>) He gives the reason why he writes a second epistle so shortly after the first. Peter regards it as a fixed principle, that there is more and more need of admonition on account of the increasing corruption of wicked men: ch. <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰδότας</span>, <span class="ital">knowing</span>) the truth.—<span class="greekheb">ἐστηριγμένους</span>, <span class="ital">established</span>) Closely connected with this is the word <span class="greekheb">διεγείρειν</span>, <span class="ital">to stir up</span>, <a href="/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2 Peter 1:13</a>. He wishes them to be both firm and as much on the alert as possible.—<span class="greekheb">παρούσῃ</span>, <span class="ital">present</span>) Truth is present, as in the New Testament: <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm" title="By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand.">1 Peter 5:12</a>, note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] <span class="greekheb">Μελλήσω</span> is read by ABC Vulg.

The apostle will take every opportunity of reminding his readers of the truths and duties which he has been describing, and that because faith in those truths and the practice of those duties is the only way to Christ's eternal kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Though ye know them, and be established in the present truth;</span> better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and are established in the truth which is with you.</span> These words seem to imply that St. Peter knew something, through Silvanus (see <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), of those to whom he was writing; they were not ignorant of the gospel; now they had read his First Epistle, and earlier they had heard the preaching of St. Paul or his companions (comp. <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>). (For the word rendered "established" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16, 17</a>.) St. Peter seems to have kept ever in his thoughts the solemn charge of the Saviour, "When thou art converted, strengthen (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) thy brethren" (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>).

The better reading, however, is &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; I intend, or, as often in classical Greek, with a sense of certainty - I shall be sure, which Rev. adopts, rendering I shall be ready. The formula occurs in but one other passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>, where it is translated by the simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense, as ye surely will hear.<p>Ye know (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., knowing.

Perhaps the exhortation, "strengthen thy brethren," may account for his repeated use of this word and its derivatives.
