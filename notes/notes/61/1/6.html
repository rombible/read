Virtue and knowledge are energetic and progressive; they are exercised in developing the powers implanted in us. Self-control and patience are restrictive and disciplinary; they are exercised in checking and regulating the conflicting claims of many co-existing powers, so as to reduce all to harmony. There is special point in “self-control” being placed as the consequence of “knowledge.” The false teachers would insist that knowledge led to liberty, which with them meant emancipation from all control whatever. Self-mastery is to the world at large the opposite of liberty; to the Christian it is another name for it—that service which is perfect freedom. Patience to the world is to accept loss and suffering; to the Christian it is to win the best of prizes—“in your patience ye shall win your souls.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_peter/1-6.htm" title="And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;...">2 Peter 1:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And to knowledge, temperance </span>— This virtue consists in a confirmed habit of ruling all the affections, passions, and appetites of our nature in a proper manner, by placing our affections on proper objects; by restraining our angry, peevish, envious, and unholy tempers, and by using moderation in gratifying our appetites. Christian temperance, indeed, includes the voluntary abstaining from all pleasure which does not lead to God, extending to all things inward and outward, and implying the due government of our thoughts and imaginations, as well as of our desires and designs. It is the <span class="ital">using the world </span>properly: so to use all outward, and so to restrain all inward things, that they may become a means of what is spiritual; a scaling-ladder to ascend to what is above. <span class="ital">Intemperance </span>is to abuse the world. He that uses any thing below, looking no higher, and getting no farther, is intemperate. He that uses the creature only so as to attain to more of the Creator, is alone <span class="ital">temperate in all things, </span>and walks as Christ himself walked; <span class="ital">and to temperance, patience </span>— Bear as well as forbear; sustain as well as abstain; take up your cross, as well as deny yourself, daily; and the more knowledge you have, do this the more: the more steadily and resolutely renounce your own will; submit to, and acquiesce in, the will of God; and indulge yourself the less. <span class="ital">Knowledge puffeth up; </span>and the great boasters of knowledge, the Gnostics, were those that turned the grace of God into wantonness, being <span class="ital">lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, </span>and of course effeminate and unprepared to encounter any opposition, or to endure any hardship on account of truth and a good conscience. But see that your knowledge be attended with temperance, and your temperance with patience; <span class="ital">and to patience, godliness</span> — Its proper support; a continual sense of God’s wisdom, power, and goodness; of his holiness, truth, justice, and mercy; of his presence and providence, with a reverential, awful, filial, and loving fear of, and confidence in him. Otherwise your patience may be pride, surliness, stoicism; but it will not be Christianity. <span class="ital">And to godliness, brotherly kindness </span>— Sullenness, sternness, moroseness, are not consistent with genuine godliness. <span class="ital">Sour godliness, </span>so called, is of the devil. Of Christian godliness it may always be said: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Mild, sweet, serene, and tender is her mood, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor grave with sternness, nor with lightness free; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against example resolutely good, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Fervent in zeal, and warm in charity.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And to brotherly kindness, love </span>— The pure and perfect love of God and of all mankind. The apostle here makes an advance upon the preceding article, <span class="ital">brotherly kindness, </span>which seems only to relate to the love of Christians toward one another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to knowledge temperance - On the meaning of the word "temperance," see the <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a> note, and <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a> note.

Avoiding all excess in eating and drinking, and all impure and unclean lusts; for it signifies nothing what a man knows, or professes to know, if his life is a scene of intemperance and debauchery: this seems to be levelled against the followers or Simon Magus, who ascertained salvation to knowledge, though the life was ever so impure, Moreover, this may include abstinence, not only from hurtful lusts, but from the use of things indifferent, when the peace and comfort of a weak brother are endangered; for then to knowledge must be added love, otherwise that knowledge will not be right, at least not rightly used; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, <p>and to temperance, patience; which is necessary to the running of the Christian race, which is attended with many difficulties and exercises; and under affliction from the hand of God, that there be no murmuring nor repining; and under reproaches and persecutions from men, that they faint not, and are not discouraged by them; and in the expectation of the heavenly glory: this is proper to be superadded to the former, because there may be intemperance in passion, as well as in the use of the creatures; a man may be inebriated with wrath and anger, and overcome with impatience, as well as with wine and strong drink: <p>and to patience, godliness; either internal, which is distinguished from bodily exercise, or outward worship, and lies in the inward and powerful exercise of grace, as faith, hope, love, fear, &amp;c. and the Syriac version here renders it, "the fear of God": or rather external, and intends the whole worship of God, as prayer, praise, hearing of the word, and attendance on all ordinances. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</span><p>(6) He brings up certain and other principal virtues, of which some pertain to the first table of the law, others to the last.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-6.htm" title="And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;">2 Peter 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγκράτειαν</span>: “self-control”: accompanied by, and arising from, knowledge, and not a mere product of fear or submission to authority. <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονήν</span>: “steadfastness”—not turned aside from the faith by trial and suffering (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>, <a href="/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;">Romans 5:3</a> ff.).

Not merely endurance of the inevitable, for Christ could have relieved himself of his sufferings (<a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>; compare <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>); but the heroic, brave patience with which a Christian not only bears but contends. Speaking of Christ's patience, Barrow remarks, "Neither was it out of a stupid insensibility or stubborn resolution that he did thus behave himself; for he had a most vigorous sense of all those grievances, and a strong (natural) aversation from under going them;...but from a perfect submission to the divine will, and entire command over his passions, an excessive charity toward mankind, this patient and meek behavior did spring." The same writer defines patience as follows: "That virtue which qualifieth us to bear all conditions and all events, by God's disposal incident to us, with such apprehensions and persuasions of mind, such dispositions and affections of heart, such external deportment and practices of life as God requireth and good reason directeth (Sermon XLII., "On Patience").<p>Godliness<p>See on <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>. The quality is never ascribed to God.<p>Brotherly kindness (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev. renders, literally, love of the brethren.<p>Charity (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>There seems at first an infelicity in the rendering of the Rev., in your love of the brethren love. But this is only apparent. In the former word Peter contemplates Christian fellow-believers as naturally and properly holding the first place in our affections (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>, "Especially unto them which are of the household of faith"). But he follows this with the broader affection which should characterize Christians, and which Paul lauds in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>, the love of men as men. It may be remarked here that the entire rejection by the Rev. of charity as the rendering of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; is wholesome and defensible. Charity has acquired two peculiar meanings, both of which are indeed included or implied in love, but neither of which expresses more than a single phase of love - tolerance and beneficence. The A. V. in the great majority of cases translates love; always in the Gospels, and mostly elsewhere. There is no more reason for saying "charity suffereth long," than for saying, "the charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts," or "God is charity." </body></html>
