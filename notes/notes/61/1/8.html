This is the goal towards which all these virtues tend, the fruit which they tend to produce—the perfect knowledge of Christ. Those who are the most like Christ in their lives have the fullest knowledge of Him in this world, a knowledge to be perfected in the next world, when, purified from sin, “we shall see Him as He is.” This clause, without the negatives, accurately describes the condition of the false teachers whom the Apostle has in view. They were both “idle and unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” They neither did nor produced anything that in any degree advanced such knowledge either in themselves or others. The list of virtues just commended (<a href="/context/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5-7</a>) constitutes a solemn indictment against them. Practical infidelity leading to vicious conduct; a hollow and pretentious philosophy leading to libertinism; an impatience of control leading to utter godlessness; a selfish indifference to the claims of those nearest to them ending in absolute heartlessness towards all men—such is the charge brought against them, by implication here, directly in 2 Peter 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">For if these things be in you </span>— This faith, this courage, this knowledge, &c.

Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if these things be in you, and abound - If they are in you in rich abundance; if you are eminent for these things.<p>They make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful - They will show that you are not barren or unfruitful.

In nothing is there, in fact, more encouragement than in the attempt to become eminent in piety. On no other efforts does God smile more propitiously than on the attempt to secure the salvation of the soul and to do good. A small part of the exertions which men put forth to become rich, or learned, or celebrated for oratory or heroism, would secure the salvation of the soul. In the former, also, men often fail; in the latter, never. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. be&#8212;Greek, "subsist" that is, supposing these things to have an actual subsistence in you; "be" would express the mere matter-of-fact being (Ac 16:20).<p>abound&#8212;more than in others; so the Greek.<p>make&#8212;"render," "constitute you," habitually, by the very fact of possessing these graces.<p>barren&#8212;"inactive," and, as a field lying fallow and unworked (Greek), so barren and useless.<p>unfruitful in&#8212;rather, &#8230; in respect to, "The full knowledge (Greek) of Christ" is the goal towards which all these graces tend.

There is a knowledge of Christ which is barren and fruitless; and those that have it are so in their conversations, and it will be of no avail to them another day: and this is a mere notional and speculative knowledge, such as is not attended with any inward experience and application of Christ to themselves, or any fruits of righteousness in their lives, and is a bare theory of things relating to his person, offices, and works; but there is a knowledge of him that is spiritual and experimental, by which a soul not only approves of Christ, but places its trust and confidence in him, and appropriates him to himself, and practically observes his commands and ordinances in the faith of him; and in love to him he performs the above duties, and exercises the above graces; from whence it appears, that he is neither barren nor unfruitful himself in the profession of his knowledge of Christ; "or in the acknowledgment of him", as it may be rendered; nor is that a vain, empty, and useless thing: he is not like the barren fig tree, or the earth that bears briers and thorns, and is nigh to cursing and burning, but like a tree planted by a river of water, and is green, flourishing, and fruitful.

The participles may be resolved into “in that,” “since” (Dietlein), or “if” (Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott); the latter is to be preferred, inasmuch as this verse refers back to the exhortation <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a>, and in “<a href="/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a> the opposite is assumed as possible” (Brückner); thus: “<span class="ital">for if these virtues exist in you, and that in rich measure</span>;” Luther in his translation has combined the two translations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀργοὺς οὐδὲ ἀκάρπους καθίστησιν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> is to be supplied.

The “knowledge” is the higher <span class="ital">epignosis</span> of <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>, and its position here, as the end and crown of the Christian hope, well illustrates its relation to the <span class="ital">gnosis</span> which belongs to an earlier and less perfect state.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Peter 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">these things</span>) <span class="ital">Virtue, moderation</span>, etc. A condition is involved: If you have these things, then indeed you have true knowledge. Comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a>, <span class="ital">for</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν ὑπάρχοντα</span>, <span class="ital">if they are in you</span>) in truth. The same phrase occurs, <a href="/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a>. The expression, <span class="ital">not barren</span>, refers to this.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ πλεονάζοντα</span>, <span class="ital">and abound</span>) copiously. Abundance quickly follows truth. The expression, <span class="ital">nor unfruitful</span>, refers to this: that is, you shall have the fruit, which the knowledge of Jesus Christ produces, in excellence and abundance: ch. <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καθίστησιν</span>, <span class="ital">they render</span> or <span class="ital">establish</span>) at present.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>) Comp. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">in, in respect to</span>, <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσιν</span>, the <span class="ital">acknowledging</span>) <span class="ital">the recognition</span>, united with <span class="ital">the cleansing from sins</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if these things be in you, and abound;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for these things belonging to you and abounding make</span>, etc. The word  used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) implies actual possession; these graces must be made our own; they must be wrought into our characters: then they will increase and multiply, for the grace of God cannot lie still, it must ever he advancing from glory to glory. <span class="cmt_word">They make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they make you not idle nor yet unfruitful towards the full knowledge.</span> The Greek word for "knowledge" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (on which see verse 2, and note there). Here we know only in part, we see through a glass darkly; but that imperfect knowledge should be ever growing, increasing in fullness and distinctness (see chapter 2 Peter 3:18). The various graces of the Christian character, realized in the heart, will lead us on towards that fuller knowledge of Christ; if they are really ours, they will not allow us to be idle, they must bring forth the fruit of good works; and the life of righteousness by faith draws the Christian onwards in the knowledge of Christ: we learn to knew him by following him (comp. <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9, 10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be in you (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Rev., are yours; following the sense of possession which legitimately belongs to the verb; as <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>, that thou hast; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>, goods. In the sense of being the verb is stronger than the simple &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to be; denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore attaching to a person as a proper characteristic; something belonging to him, and so running into the idea of rightful possession as above.<p>Barren (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3b1;&#787;, not, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, work. Hence, more correctly, as Rev., idle. Compare "idle word" (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>); "standing idle" (<a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/20-6.htm">Matthew 20:6</a>); also, <a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>. The tautology, barren and unfruitful, is thus avoided.<p>In the knowledge (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., more correctly, unto. The idea is not idleness in the knowledge, but idleness in pressing on and developing toward and finally reaching the knowledge. With this agrees the compound &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, the constantly increasing and finally full knowledge. </body></html>
