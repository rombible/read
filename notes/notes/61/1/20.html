but the cognate verb occurs in <a href="/mark/4-34.htm" title="But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.">Mark 4:34</a>, where it is translated “expound.” (See Note there.) There can be little doubt that “interpretation,” or “solution,” is the right rendering here, although others have been suggested. The main question however, is the meaning of the word rendered “private,” which may also mean “its own.” Hence three explanations are possible. The term may refer (1) to the recipients of the prophecies—that we may not expound prophecy according to our own fancy; or (2) to the utterers of the prophecies—that the prophets had not the power of expounding their own prophecies; or (3) to the prophecies themselves—that no prophecy comes to be of its own interpretation, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>no prophecy explains itself. The guide to the right explanation is <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, which gives the reason <span class= "ital">why</span> “no prophecy of the scripture,” &c. This consideration excludes (3); for <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a> yields no sense as showing why prophecy does not interpret itself. Either of the other two explanations may be right. (1) If prophecy came “by the will of man,” then it might be interpreted according to man’s fancy. But it did not so come; consequently the interpretation must be sought elsewhere—viz., at the same source from which the prophecy itself proceeded. (2) If the prophets spoke just as they pleased, they would be the best exponents of what they meant. But they spoke under divine influence, and therefore need not know the import of their own words. Prophecy must be explained by prophecy and by history, not by the individual prophet. The whole body of prophecy, “the prophetic word” (<a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), is our lamp in the wilderness, not the private <span class= "ital">dicta</span> of any one seer. In modern phraseology, interpretation must be comparative and scientific. This view is strengthened by comparing <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a>, where it is stated that the prophets did not know how or when their own predictions would be fulfilled. Possibly this passage is meant to refer to <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a>, and if so, we have a mark of genuineness; a forger would have made the reference more clear. If the coincidence is accidental, this also points in the same direction; in any case, the coincidence is worth noting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation....">2 Peter 1:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Knowing this first </span>— That you may not rashly or ignorantly put a sense upon any part of the prophetic writings, not intended by the Divine Spirit which dictated them; <span class="ital">that no prophecy of the Scripture </span>— No prediction contained therein; <span class="ital">is of any private interpretation </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ιδιας επιλυσεως</span>, an expression of which various interpretations have been given, but only two of them shall be here noticed; namely, Doddridge’s, who renders it, <span class="ital">of private impulse, </span>or original; and Macknight’s, who reads, <span class="ital">of private invention. </span>But certainly no such sense can, with propriety, be forced upon the words: and why should it? Why should not the literal signification of them be acquiesced in? namely, that given in our translation.

The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing this first - Bearing this steadily in mind as a primary and most important truth.<p>That no prophecy of the Scripture - No prophecy contained in the inspired records. The word "scripture" here shows that the apostle referred particularly to the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament. The remark which he makes about prophecy is general, though it is designed to bear on a particular class of the prophecies.<p>Is of any private interpretation - The expression here used (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  idias epiluseo&#772;s) has given rise to as great a diversity of interpretation, and to as much discussion, as perhaps any phrase in the New Testament; and to the present time there is no general agreement among expositors as to its meaning. It would be foreign to the design of these notes, and would be of little utility, to enumerate the different interpretations which have been given of the passage, or to examine them in detail. It will be sufficient to remark, preparatory to endeavoring to ascertain the true sense of the passage, that some have held that it teaches that no prophecy can be interpreted of itself, but can be understood only by comparing it with the event; others, that it teaches that the prophets did not themselves understand what they wrote, but were mere passive organs under the dictation of the Holy Spirit to communicate to future times what they could not themselves explain; others, that it teaches that "no prophecy is of self-interpretation," (Horsley;) others, that it teaches that the prophecies, besides having a literal signification, have also a hidden and mystical sense which cannot be learned from the prophecies themselves, but is to be perceived by a special power of insight imparted by the Holy Spirit, enabling men to understand their recondite mysteries.<p>It would be easy to show that some of these opinions are absurd, and that none of them are sustained by the fair interpretation of the language used, and by the drift of the passage. The more correct interpretation, as it seems to me, is that which supposes that the apostle teaches that the truths which the prophets communicated were not originated by themselves; were not of their own suggestion or invention; were not their own opinions, but were of higher origin, and were imparted by God; and according to this the passage may be explained, "knowing this as a point of first importance when you approach the prophecies, or always bearing this in mind, that it is a great principle in regard to the prophets, that what they communicated "was not of their own disclosure;" that is, was not revealed or originated by them." That this is the correct interpretation will be apparent from the following considerations:<p>(1) It accords with the design of the apostle, which is to produce an impressive sense of the importance and value of the prophecies, and to lead those to whom he wrote to study them with diligence. This could be secured in no way so well as by assuring them that the writings which he wished them to study did not contain truths originated by the human mind, but that they were of higher origin.<p>(2) this interpretation accords with what is said in the following verse, and is the only one of all those proposed that is consistent with that, or in connection with which that verse will have any force. In that verse <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, a reason is given for what is said here: "For (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  gar) the prophecy came not in old time "by the will of man,"" etc. But this can be a good reason for what is said here only on the supposition that the apostle meant to say that what they communicated was not originated by themselves; that it was of a higher than human origin; that the prophets spake "as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." This fact was a good reason why they should show profound respect for the prophecies, and study them with attention. But how could the fact that "they were moved by the Holy Ghost" be a reason for studying them, if the meaning here is that the prophets could not understand their own language, or that the prophecy could be understood only by the event, or that the prophecy had a double meaning, etc.? If the prophecies were of Divine origin, then "that" was a good reason why they should be approached with reverence, and should be profoundly studied.<p>(3) this interpretation accords as well, to say the least, with the fair meaning of the language employed, as either of the other opinions proposed. The word rendered "interpretation" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  epilusis) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means "solution" (Robinson's Lexicon), "disclosure," (Prof. Stuart on the Old Testament, p. 328,) "making free (Passow,)" with the notion that what is thus released or loosed was before bound, entangled obscure. The verb from which this word is derived (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  epiluo&#772;) means, "to let loose upon," as dogs upon a hare, (Xen. Mem. 7, 8; ib 9, 10;) to loose or open letters; to loosen a band; to loose or disclose a riddle or a dark saying, and then to enlighten, illustrate, etc. - Passow. It is twice used in the New Testament. <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>, "he expounded all things to his disciples"; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-39.htm">Acts 19:39</a>, "It shall be determined in a lawful assembly."<p>The verb would be applicable to loosing anything which is bound or confined, and thence to the explanation of a mysterious doctrine or a parable, or to a disclosure of what was before unknown. The word, according to this, in the place before us, would mean the disclosure of what was before bound, or retained, or unknown; either what had never been communicated at all, or what had been communicated obscurely; and the idea is, "no prophecy recorded in the Scripture is of, or comes from, any exposition or disclosure of the will and purposes of God by the prophets themselves." It is not a thing of their own, or a private matter originating with themselves, but it is to be traced to a higher source. If this be the true interpretation, then it follows that the prophecies are to be regarded as of higher than any human origin; and then, also, it follows that this passage should not be used to prove that the prophets did not understand the nature of their own communications, or that they were mere unconscious and passive instruments in the hand of God to make known his will. Whatever may be the truth on those points, this passage proves nothing in regard to them, any mare than the fact that a minister of religion now declares truth which he did not originate, but which is to be traced to God as its author, proves that he does not understand what he himself says. It follows, also, that this passage cannot be adduced by the Papists to prove that the people at large should not have free access to the word of God, and should not be allowed to interpret it for themselves. It makes no affirmation on that point, and does not even contain any "principle" of which such a use can be made; for:<p>(1) Whatever it means, it is confined to "prophecy;" it does not embrace the whole Bible.<p>(2) whatever it means, it merely states a fact; it does not enjoin a duty. It states, as a fact, that there was something about the prophecies which was not of private solution, but it does not state that it is the duty of the church to prevent any private explanation or opinion even of the prophecies.<p>(3) it says nothing about "the church" as empowered to give a public or authorized interpretation of the prophecies. There is not a hint, or an intimation of any kind, that the church is intrusted with any such power whatever. There never was any greater perversion of a passage of Scripture than to suppose that this teaches that any class of people is not to have free access to the Bible. The effect of the passage, properly interpreted, should be to lead us to study the Bible with profound reverence, as having a higher than any human origin, not to turn away from it as if it were unintelligible, nor to lead us to suppose that it can be interpreted only by one class of men. The fact that it discloses truths which the human mind could not of itself have originated, is a good reason for studying it with diligence and with prayer - not for supposing that it is unlawful for us to attempt to understand it; a good reason for reverence and veneration for it - not for sanctified neglect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. "Forasmuch as ye know this" (1Pe 1:18).<p>first&#8212;the foremost consideration in studying the word of prophecy. Laying it down as a first principle never to be lost sight of.<p>is&#8212;Greek, not the simple verb, to be, but to begin to be, "proves to be," "becometh." No prophecy is found to be the result of "private (the mere individual writer's uninspired) interpretation" (solution), and so origination. The Greek noun epilusis, does not mean in itself origination; but that which the sacred writer could not always fully interpret, though being the speaker or writer (as 1Pe 1:10-12 implies), was plainly not of his own, but of God's disclosure, origination, and inspiration, as Peter proceeds to add, "But holy men &#8230; spake (and afterwards wrote) &#8230; moved by the Holy Ghost": a reason why ye should "give" all "heed" to it. The parallelism to 2Pe 1:16 shows that "private interpretation," contrasted with "moved by the Holy Ghost," here answers to "fables devised by (human) wisdom," contrasted with "we were eye-witnesses of His majesty," as attested by the "voice from God." The words of the prophetical (and so of all) Scripture writers were not mere words of the individuals, and therefore to be interpreted by them, but of "the Holy Ghost" by whom they were "moved." "Private" is explained, 2Pe 1:21, "by the will of man" (namely, the individual writer). In a secondary sense the text teaches also, as the word is the Holy Spirit's, it cannot be interpreted by its readers (any more than by its writers) by their mere private human powers, but by the teaching of the Holy Ghost (Joh 16:14). "He who is the author of Scripture is its supreme interpreter" [Gerhard]. Alford translates, "springs not out of human interpretation," that is, is not a prognostication made by a man knowing what he means when he utters it, but," &c. (Joh 11:49-52). Rightly: except that the verb is rather, doth become, or prove to be. It not being of private interpretation, you must "give heed" to it, looking for the Spirit's illumination "in your hearts" (compare Note, see on [2628]2Pe 1:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Knowing this first; </span> either, principally and above other things, as being most worthy to be known; or, knowing this as the first principle of faith, or the first thing to be believed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation:</span> the Greek word here used may be rendered, either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And then this doth not immediately concern the interpretation of the Scripture, but the first revelation of it, spoken of in the next verse; and the question is not: Who hath authority to interpret the Scripture now written? But: What authority the penmen had to write it? And consequently, what respect is due to it? And why believers are so carefully to take heed to it? And then the meaning is, that it is the first principle of our faith, that the Scripture is not of human invention, but Divine inspiration; that the prophets wrote not their own private sense in it, but the mind of God; and at his command, not their own pleasure. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_peter/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Knowing this first,....

For the construction of <span class="greekheb">γίνεται</span> c. gen., cf. Winer, p. 184 [E. T. 244]; Buttm. p. 142; according to Buttmann, the genitive definition of the thing with <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> or <span class="greekheb">γίνεσθαι</span> frequently denotes a permanent attribute; thus here: prophecy is of such a kind that it, etc.; the more precise definition depends on the meaning of the words: <span class="greekheb">ἰδίας ἐπιλύσεως</span>. Instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλύσεως</span>, Grotius would read: <span class="greekheb">ἐπηλύσεως</span>, and Heinsius: <span class="greekheb">ἐπελεύσεως</span>, so that the sense would be: the <span class="greekheb">προφητεία</span> non est res proprii impetus s. instinctus; but these changes have been justly rejected by Wolf already as arbitrary. Not less unwarranted is it to understand, with Hammond, <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span> originally de emissione cursorum e carceribus, deducing therefrom the thought: that the prophets non a se, sed a Deo missi currerent; or, with Clericus: de solutione oris; or, with Lakemacher, to derive <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλεύθω</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπέρχομαι</span>), instead of from <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλύειν</span>, thus obtaining the idea: that prophecy is not accessus proprie aut talis, quae virtute quadam mentis humanae propria et naturali proveniat et ad hominem quasi accedat (cf. Wolf <span class="ital">in loc.</span>). The notion that <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span> is equal to dissolutio (Hardt: omnis promissio non est dissolutionis sed indissolubilis, immutabilis, etc.; similarly Storr, <span class="ital">Opp</span>.

Wolf): <span class="greekheb">προφητεία οὐκ ἔχει τὴν ἑαυτῆς ἐπίλυσιν</span>, that is, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐπιλύει ἑαυτήν</span>; thus also Wahl, Dietlein, Brückner. The positive idea here to be supplied is: but “the interpretation is to be looked for only from God” (Brückner; Dietlein arbitrarily finds the further idea contained here, that prophecy must not be treated as allegory). (2) To the prophets themselves; Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ᾔδεσαν</span> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ προφῆται</span>) <span class="greekheb">μὲν καὶ συνίεσαν τὸν καταπεμπόμενον αὐτοῖς προφητικὸν λόγον</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ μέντοι καὶ τὴν ἐπίλυσιν αὐτοῦ ἐποιοῦντο</span> (similarly Knapp, de Wette); and the thought to be supplied here is: the interpretation is then not an easy, but a difficult matter (de Wette: “the author makes this remark in order to excuse the difficulty of the interpretation, and to take away the pretext for unbelief or scoffing”). (3) To the readers or to man generally. This is the view most generally adopted; it is that of Beda, Erasmus, Luther, Aretius, Gerhard, Pott, Steiger, Schmid, Besser, Wiesinger, Schott, Hofmann, etc.; and the positive thought to be supplied is: only the Holy Spirit can expound the prediction (Luther: “act accordingly, and do not think that you can interpret Scripture according to your own reason or cunning; Peter has forbidden it, you are not to interpret, the Holy Spirit must interpret, or it must remain uninterpreted”). But opposed to all these interpretations is—(1) The necessity of supplying the positive thought which really contains the point of the remark, but to which the apostle does not give expression; (2) The connection of thought, according to which <a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a> is subjoined as a confirmation of the <span class="greekheb">ᾧ καλῶς ποιεῖτε προσέχοντες</span>. If the thought here expressed were intended to give a caution with respect to the <span class="greekheb">προσέχειν</span>, or to form, as Wiesinger says, a condition preliminary and necessary to it, this must in some way have been referred to. Besides, it must be noted that <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> or <span class="greekheb">γίνεσθαι</span>, c. gen., implies a relation of dependence, and in such a way that the genitive denotes that on which something else depends.[55] Now it may, indeed, be said that the “understanding” of prophecy, but not that prophecy itself, depends on the interpretation of it. The rendering: “prophecy is not a matter of private interpretation” (or even: “it does not permit of private interpretation,” Hofmann), takes too little account of the force of the genitive.[56] For these reasons <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊΛΥΣΙς</span></span></span> must necessarily be understood rather of an “interpretation” on which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΦΗΤΕΊΑ</span></span></span> is based, on which it depends. But this is the explanation of the problematic future itself, or of the figure under which it presented itself to the prophets (thus, too, Gerlach and Fronmüller).[57] The passage above cited makes the matter clear. <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.">Genesis 40:8</a> : the words, in which Joseph predicted to the prisoners what lay before them, form the <span class="greekheb">προφητεία</span>; this presupposes an <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span>, interpretation, of the dream by Joseph, and of this Joseph says that it belongs to God. Thus, too, he speaks to Pharaoh: the interpretation is not in me, <a href="/context/genesis/41-15.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it....">Genesis 41:15-16</a>; cf. Dan. chap. 2<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The thought accordingly is this: no prophecy of Scripture arises out of, or depends on, private (of him who utters the prophecy) interpretation of the future. Taken thus, the verse stands in close and correct connection both with what precedes, for it states why the <span class="greekheb">λόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προφ</span>. is <span class="greekheb">βέβαιος</span> <span class="ital">whereunto it is right to take heed</span>, as unto a light in a dark place (namely, because it is based on no human interpretation); and at the same time with what follows, which serves to explain and confirm the thought (inasmuch as it more precisely defines the idea, and by the positive statement confirms the negation).[58] Brückner incorrectly, therefore, objects to this interpretation, that although it may be in harmony with <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a>, it cannot with propriety be connected with <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2 Peter 1:19</a>; and if Brückner and Wiesinger further urge against it that it arbitrarily supplies the object of <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span>, it must be replied, that object is rather supplied of itself out of the connection with <span class="greekheb">προφητεία</span>. The present <span class="greekheb">γίνεται</span> alone seems to be inappropriate, but this may be explained by supposing that the thought is conceived in the form of a general statement; this Brückner has recognised, whilst Wiesinger leaves it unnoticed.[59]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] Certainly, also, the above construction can merely express the relation of belonging to, as in <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm" title="Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.">Hebrews 12:11</a>; but in that passage the ideas <span class="greekheb">παιδεία</span> and <span class="greekheb">χαρᾶς</span> (<span class="greekheb">λύπης</span>) stand in an altogether different relation to each other, from that in which <span class="greekheb">προφητεία</span> here stands to <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] Hofmann’s remark is indeed very apodictic, that “the first of these counter reasons is null, and that accordingly the second is so too, because <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο πρῶτον γινώσκοντες</span> means a perception, which must be combined with the attending to the word of prophecy … but a perception, the substance of which could only be expressed negatively, because meant only to <span class="ital">guard</span> the prophecy against an interpretation brought about by the conclusions of the individual intellect;” but the objection to this is the same as that to the second counter reason above. If the author wished the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> … <span class="greekheb">γινώσκοντες</span> to be understood in the sense of <span class="ital">guarding against</span>, he would at least have added a <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>.—It is not easy to understand why the author, if he had wished to express the thought which his words are supposed to contain, did not write: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐπίλυσις προφητείας οὐ γίνεται ἐξ ἀνθρώπων</span>, or something similar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Bengel’s interpretation is similar: <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span> dicitur interpretation, qua ipsi prophetae res antea plane clausas <span class="ital">aperuere</span> mortalibus, only that here no definite distinction is drawn between <span class="greekheb">προφ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] On the other hand, in the usual way of understanding this passage, ver. 21 is most inappropriately connected with ver. 20, since no explanation is given of the idea that the interpretation of the prophecy, because it is not the work of man, can only be expected from the Holy Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] Steinfass thinks that the author refers to Daniel, chap. 12., and that <span class="greekheb">ἐπίλυσις</span> means the answer given in ver. 12 to Daniel’s question in ver. 8, by which the indefinite statement of time is definitely fixed. This singular opinion is, however, contradicted by the single expression <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο πρῶτον γινώσκοντες</span>. “Recognising this truth above all else” (in your reading of Scripture).

This passage is a noted crux. (1) Hardt, followed by Lange, Spitta and others interpret <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλυς</span>. = <span class="ital">dissolutio</span>. “No prophecy of S. is of such a kind that it can be annulled”. But no satisfactory instance of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλυς</span>. in this sense can be adduced. (2) Accepting the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἰδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλ</span>. = “private,” or “human interpretation,” Von Soden sees a reference to the methods of the false teachers in their attitude to Scripture (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2 Peter 1:16</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2 Peter 2:1</a>). <span class="greekheb">ἰδίας</span> “is opposed to the <span class="greekheb">φωνὴ ἐνεχθεῖσα</span> of <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a>”. (3) It seems most satisfactory to understand <span class="greekheb">ἰδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλ</span>. as the meaning of the prophet himself, or what was in the prophet’s mind when he wrote; the fulfilment in any particular generation or epoch. “The special work of the prophet is to interpret the working of God to his own generation. But in doing this, he is laying down the principles of God’s action generally. Hence there may be many fulfilments of one prophecy, or to speak more exactly, many historical illustrations of some one principle of Providential Government” (Mayor, p. 196). The genitive <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλύσεως</span> is gen. of definition and not of origin. “No prophecy is of such a nature as to be capable of a particular interpretation.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation</span>] The true meaning of the passage turns partly on the actual significance of the last word, partly on the sequence of thought as connected with the foregoing. The noun itself does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament nor in the LXX., but in Aquila’s version of <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.">Genesis 40:8</a> it is given as the equivalent of “interpretation.” The corresponding verb meets us, however, in <a href="/mark/4-34.htm" title="But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.">Mark 4:34</a> (“he <span class="ital">explained</span> all things to his disciples”) and in <a href="/acts/19-39.htm" title="But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.">Acts 19:39</a> (“it shall be <span class="ital">determined</span>”), and this leaves no doubt that “interpretation” or “solution” is the right rendering. Nor again is there much room for doubt as to the meaning of “prophecy of scripture.” The words can only point to a “prophetic word” embodied in a writing and recognised as Scripture. We have seen, however (see note on <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:...">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>), that the gift of prophecy was thought of as belonging to the present as fully as to the past, and chap. <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn.

Stress must also be laid on the Greek verb rendered “is,” which might better be translated <span class="bld">cometh</span>, or <span class="bld">cometh into being</span>. With these data the true explanation of the passage is not far to seek. The Apostle calls on men to give heed to the prophetic word on the ground that no prophecy, authenticated as such by being recognised as part of Scripture, whether that Scripture belongs to the Old, or the New Covenant, comes by the prophet’s own interpretation of the facts with which he has to deal, whether those facts concern the outer history of the world, or the unfolding of the eternal truths of God’s Kingdom. It is borne to him, as he proceeds to shew in the next verse, from a higher source, from that which is, in the truest sense of the word, an inspiration. The views held by some commentators, (1) that St Peter is protesting against the application of private judgment to the interpretation of prophecy, and (2) that he is contending that no single prophecy can be interpreted apart from the whole body of prophetic teaching contained in Scripture, are, it is believed, less satisfactory explanations of the Apostle’s meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">this</span>) The reason of the phrase, <span class="ital">ye do well</span>, inasmuch as <span class="ital">ye know this</span>.—<span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>) <span class="ital">before</span> I speak: German, <span class="ital">vorhin, before</span>.

The literal translation of the following clause is, "that all prophecy of Scripture [there is no article] is not; all...  not" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>) being a common Hebraism for none, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but the verb is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "is," but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "becomes, arises, comes into being." The word for "private" is <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "special," or commonly, "one's own" (see <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5</a>; chapter 2 Peter 2:16, 22; 3:3, 16, 17). The word rendered "interpretation" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is found nowhere else in the New Testament; the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>, "He expounded all things;" and <a href="/acts/19-39.htm">Acts 19:39</a>, "It shall be determined or settled." These considerations, strengthened by the context, seem to guide us to the following explanation: No prophecy of Scripture arises from the prophet's own interpretation of the vision presented to his mind; for it was from God that the prophecy was brought, and men spoke as they were borne on by the Holy Spirit. This view of the passage is also supported by the remarkable parallel in the First Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>). The prophets searched diligently into the meaning of the revelation vouchsafed to them; they did not always comprehend it in all its details; they could not interpret it to themselves; the written prophecy arose out of the interpretation of the revelation supplied by the same Spirit from whom the revelation itself proceeded. Therefore the prophetic books of Holy Scripture are sacred and precious, and we do well in giving heed to them; though the day-star of the Lord's own presence, shining in the illuminated heart, is holier still. Other views of this difficult passage are: Prophecy is not its own interpreter; the guidance of the Spirit is necessary. Or, prophecy is not a matter for the private interpretation of the readers; only the Holy Spirit can explain it. But the explanation adopted seems most accordant with the Greek words and with the general sense of the context (compare St. Paul's teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). The gifts of the Spirit are divided as he will; to one man are given "divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues." Not every one, it seems, who had the first gift, had also the latter. Tongues and the interpretation of tongues were two distinct gifts. It may be so with prophecy and the interpretation of prophecy. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Is (&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>More literally, arises or originates.<p>Private (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>.
