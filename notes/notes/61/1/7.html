And though “charity begins at home” with “them who are of the household of faith,” it must not end there, but reach out to all men, whether Christians or not. (Comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>.) The translation “brotherly kindness” is a little to be regretted; it obscures the exact meaning of the Word, and also the fact that the very same word is used in <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>. “Love of the brethren” means love of Christians as such, as members of the same great family, as God’s adopted children. “Charity” means love of men as such, as creatures made in the likeness of God, as souls for which Christ died. The word for “charity” is emphatically Christian love; not mere natural benevolence.<p>Each in this noble chain of virtues prepares the way for the next, and is supplemented and perfected by it. It begins with faith, and it ends (like St. Paul’s list of virtues, <a href="/context/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12-14</a>) with charity. But we must not insist too strongly upon the order in the series, as being either logically or chronologically necessary. It is a natural order that is here given, but not the only one. These three verses are the First Epistle condensed. Each one of the virtues mentioned here is represented quite distinctly in 1 Peter: virtue, <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>; knowledge, <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>; self-control, <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>; patience, <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; godliness, <a href="/context/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15-16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>; love of the brethren, <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1Peter 3:8</a>; charity, <a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1Peter 4:8</a>.

Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to godliness brotherly kindness - Love to Christians as such.

"And in your godliness brotherly kindness"; not suffering your godliness to be moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind, generous, and courteous [Alford]. Your natural affection and brotherly kindness are to be sanctified by godliness. "And in your brotherly kindness love," namely, to all men, even to enemies, in thought, word, and deed. From brotherly kindness we are to go forward to love. Compare 1Th 3:12, "Love one toward another (brotherly kindness), and toward all men (charity)." So charity completes the choir of graces in Col 3:14. In a retrograde order, he who has love will exercise brotherly kindness; he who has brotherly kindness will feel godliness needful; the godly will mix nothing stoical with his patience; to the patient, temperance is easy; the temperate weighs things well, and so has knowledge; knowledge guards against sudden impulse carrying away its virtue [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Brotherly kindness; </span> a love to those that are of the household of faith.

These are to be distinguished thus, that the former applies specially to the Christian brethren, the latter to all—without distinction; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη εἰς ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰς πάντας</span> (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>); with <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφία</span>, cf. <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>. While the apostle calls the love which is extended to all <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>, he gives it to be understood that what he means is not the purely natural well-wishing, but Christian love springing from the Christian spirit. Dietlein, without sufficient reason, thinks that <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφία</span> is only the opposite of that which is forbidden in the eighth and ninth commandments, whilst the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span> is the complete antithesis to what is forbidden in the tenth commandment. In this way the conception <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφία</span> is unjustifiably disregarded,—a proceeding to which the language of Scripture gives the less sanction, that where love in all its depth and truth is spoken of, the word <span class="greekheb">φιλεῖν</span> is not unfrequently used; cf. <a href="/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>; <a href="/john/16-27.htm" title="For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.">John 16:27</a>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Although the different virtues here are not arranged according to definite logical order, yet the way in which they here belong to each other is not to be mistaken. Each of the virtues to be shown forth forms the complement of that which precedes, and thus gives rise to a firmly-linked chain of thought. <span class="greekheb">ἀρετή</span> supplies the complement of <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, for faith without virtue is wanting in moral character, and is in itself dead; that of <span class="greekheb">ἀρετή</span> is <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span>, for the realizing of the moral volition is conditioned by comprehension of that which is needful in each separate case; that of <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> is <span class="greekheb">ἐγκράτεια</span>, for self-control must not be wanting to volition and comprehension; that of <span class="greekheb">ἐγκράτεια</span> is <span class="greekheb">ὑπομενή</span>, for there are outward as well as inward temptations to be withstood; that of <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> is <span class="greekheb">εὐσέβεια</span>, for only in trustful love to God has the <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> firm support; that of <span class="greekheb">εὐσέβεια</span> the <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφία</span>, for “he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?” (<a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>); that of <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφία</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>, for without the latter the former would degenerate into poor narrow-heartedness. Thus, in that the one virtue is the complement of the other, the latter produces the former of itself as its natural outcome; Bengel: praesens quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit, subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit.[34]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] According to Dietlein, the three first graces, including <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, correspond to the first table of the law, the three first petitions of the Lord’s Prayer, the first article of the Creed, and to <span class="ital">faith</span> in the Pauline triad; the three following graces to the first half of the second table of the law, the fourth petition in the Lord’s Prayer, the second article of the Creed, and the second grace in the Pauline triad; the two last graces to the second half of the second table of the law, the three last petitions of the Lord’s Prayer, the third article of the Creed, and the third grace of that triad. Certainly there is here a good deal that coincides, but this by no means warrants a consistent parallelism of all the individual points, which can only gain an appearance of correctness by an arbitrary narrowing or extending of the ideas and their applications.—It is worthy of remark that the series begins with <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> and ends with <span class="greekheb">ἀγάκπ</span>; in that, then, ver. 11 points to the future, <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span> is added, so that the well-known triad is here alluded to (Schott).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2 Peter 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">φιλαδελφίαν</span>: “affection towards the brethren,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of the same Christian community. <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπην</span>: probably love towards all, even enemies; not directed by sense and emotion, but by deliberate choice (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>).

"In your godliness," St. Peter says, "ye must develop brotherly kindness, the unfeigned love of the brethren;" for "every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him" (<a href="/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>). And as God is loving unto every man, and "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," so Christians, who are taught to be followers (imitators) of God (<a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>), must learn in the exercise of love toward the brethren that larger love which embraces all men in an ever-widening circle (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Thus love, the greatest of all Christian graces (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), is the climax in St. Peter's list. Out of faith, the root, spring the seven fair fruits of holiness, of which holy love is the fairest and the sweetest (comp. Ignatius, 'Ad Ephes.,' 14. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>). No grace can remain alone; each grace, as it is gradually formed in the soul, tends to develop and strengthen others; all graces meet in that highest grace of charity, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before God. Bengel says well, "Praeseus quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit, subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit." </body></html>
