Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>.

By raining brimstone and fire upon them from heaven, <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a> which soon reduced them to ashes, with Admah and Zeboiim, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-25.htm">Deuteronomy 29:25</a>, cities delightfully situated, which were as the garden of God, and the land of Egypt, together with the inhabitants of them; and after they had received a signal mercy, in being rescued by Abraham from the kings who had carried them captive; and though Abraham, the friend of God, interceded for them, and righteous Lot dwelt among them. The first of these cities is in the Hebrew language called Sedom; Philo the Jew (w) calls it Sodoma, as in <a href="/romans/9-29.htm">Romans 9:29</a> and in the Septuagint on <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> here it is said to be a city, and Josephus (x) always calls it the city of the Sodomites, but in <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a> we read of the land of Sodom; and so Philo (y) the Jew speaks of  the region or country of the Sodomites; here the word is of the plural number, as in <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a> as it is also in the Septuagint in <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and in Philo the Jew (z), and so is Gomorrah in some copies of this, place, as in <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>. Solinus, the historian, gives an account of these cities, in agreement with this; <p>"a good way off of Jerusalem (he says (a)) is opened a sorrowful gulf, which the black ground, "in cinerem soluta", "reduced to ashes", shows it to be touched by heaven; there were two towns, or cities, the one called Sodom, and the other Gomorrah; where an apple is produced, which, although it has an appearance of ripeness, cannot be eaten; for the outward skin that encompasses it only contains a sort of soot, or embers within, which, ever so lightly squeezed, evaporates into smoke and dust;'' <p>and so the author of the book of Wisdom 10:7 speaking of the five cities, on which fire fell, says, <p>"of whose wickedness, even to this day, the waste land that smoketh is a testimony; and plants bearing fruit, that never come to ripeness.'' <p>Philo the Jew (b) says, that <p>"there are showed to this day in Syria monuments of this unspeakable destruction that happened; as ruins, ashes, sulphur, smoke, and a weak flame, breaking forth as of a fire burning:'' <p>condemned them with an overthrow; by this sad "catastrophe" God condemned the sins of those men of Sodom and Gomorrah, and condemned their persons to everlasting damnation; of which their temporal punishment was an emblem and figure; see Jde 1:7, the word "overthrow" is generally used when this destruction is spoken of, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> and therefore retained by the apostle here: <p>making them ensamples unto those who after should live ungodly; in the commission of any sins, and be open, bold, and impudent in them, and declare them as they did; and especially that should live in the commission of the same sins, those unnatural lusts and uncleannesses, which to this day go by the name of "sodomy", and "sodomitical" practices; now the punishment of the inhabitants of these cities was an ensample to such wicked conduct, showing what they must expect, and was a representation of those everlasting burnings, which such sinners, as a righteous retaliation for their burning lusts, shall be cast into.

It may be noted that that destruction had been used as an illustration by the older prophets (<a href="/context/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah....">Isaiah 1:9-10</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/16-48.htm" title="As I live, said the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters....">Ezekiel 16:48-56</a>) as well as by our Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm" title="And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample to those that after should live ungodly;">2 Peter 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πόλεις</span>, <span class="ital">cities</span>) There were therefore sins of the same description in the neighbourhood of Sodom, Gomorrha, etc.—<span class="greekheb">τεφρώσας καταστροφῇ</span>, <span class="ital">turning them into ashes with an overthrow</span>) The words <span class="greekheb">καταστρέφειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">καταστροφὴ</span> are thus used, <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm" title="And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.">Genesis 19:29</a>, Septuagint.—<span class="greekheb">τεθεικὼς</span>, <span class="ital">placing</span>) [rendering them].
