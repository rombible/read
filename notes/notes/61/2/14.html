Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having eyes full of adultery - Margin, as in the Greek, "an adulteress;" that is, gazing with desire after such persons. The word "full" is designed to denote that the corrupt passion referred to had wholly seized and occupied their minds. The eye was, as it were, full of this passion; it saw nothing else but some occasion for its indulgence; it expressed nothing else but the desire. The reference here is to the sacred festival mentioned in the previous verse; and the meaning is, that they celebrated that festival with licentious feelings, giving free indulgence to their corrupt desires by gazing on the females who were assembled with them. In the passion here referred to, the "eye" is usually the first offender, the inlet to corrupt desires, and the medium by which they are expressed. Compare the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>. The wanton glance is a principal occasion of exciting the sin; and there is much often in dress, and mien, and gesture, to charm the eye and to deepen the debasing passion.<p>And that cannot cease from sin - They cannot look on the females who may be present without sinning. Compare <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>. There are many men in whom the presence of the most virtuous woman only excites impure and corrupt desires. The expression here does not mean that they have no natural ability to cease from sin, or that they are impelled to it by any physical necessity, but only that they are so corrupt and unprincipled that they certainly will sin always.<p>Beguiling unstable souls - Those who are not strong in Christian principle, or who are naturally fluctuating and irresolute. The word rendered beguiling means to bait, to entrap, and would be applicable to the methods practiced in hunting. Here it means that it was one of their arts to place specious allurements before those who were known not to have settled principles or firmness, in order to allure them to sin. Compare <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>.<p>An heart they have exercised with covetous practices - Skilled in the arts which covetous men adopt in order to cheat others out of their property. A leading purpose which influenced these men was to obtain money. One of the most certain ways for dishonest men to do this is to make use of the religious principle; to corrupt and control the conscience; to make others believe that they are eminently holy, or that they are the special favorites of heaven; and when they can do this, they have the purses of others at command. For the religious principle is the most powerful of all principles; and he who can control that, can control all that a man possesses. The idea here is that these persons had made this their study, and had learned the ways in which men could be induced to part with their money under religious pretences. We should always be on our guard when professedly religious teachers propose to have much to do with money matters. While we should always be ready to aid every good cause, yet we should remember that unprincipled and indolent men often assume the mask of religion that they may practice their arts on the credulity of others, and that their real aim is to obtain their property, not to save their souls.<p>Cursed children - This is a Hebraism, meaning literally, "children of the curse," that is, persons devoted to the curse, or who will certainly be destroyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. full of adultery&#8212;literally, "full of an adulteress," as though they carried about adulteresses always dwelling in their eyes: the eye being the avenue of lust [Horneius].

Levi, the heart and the "eye" are sin's two brokers.'' <p>Hence we read (l) of , "one that commits adultery with his eyes"; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>; compare  <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>. Some read the words, "having eyes full of the adulteress": that is, having a lewd and infamous woman always in mind and sight, continually looking at her and lusting after her: <p>and that cannot cease from sin: which may be understood either of these wicked men, who are like the troubled sea, that cannot rest, but are continually casting up the mire and dirt of sin out of their polluted heart; who live and walk in sin, and are always committing it, their conversation being nothing else but one continued series of sinning; nor can they do otherwise, since they are slaves to their lusts, and are carried away with the force and power of them: or of their eyes, which were always rolling after unlawful objects; their eyes and their hearts were only, and always, for their lust, as the prophet says of others, that they were but for their covetousness, <a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>; a sin also which reigned in these men: <p>beguiling unstable souls: such as were unsteady in their principles, and unstable in their ways; were like children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, not being rooted in Christ, nor established in the faith; these, as the serpent beguiled Eye, they corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ; imposed false doctrines on them, and deceived them by false glosses and outward appearances; and by fair words and good speeches, and by their wanton looks and carnal lusts, they allured them into the sin of adultery; or ensnared them, drew them into the net and snare of Satan, and so they were taken and led captive. <p>An heart they have exercised with covetous practices; an immoderate love of money, a covetous desire after it, is the root of all evil, the bane of religion, and source of heresy, and is a vice which has always prevailed among false teachers; and the character here given well agrees with Simon Magus, the father of heresies, and his followers: hence care is always taken to insert, among, the characters and qualifications of Gospel ministers, that they be not greedy of filthy lucre, <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>; this iniquity, when it is a reigning one, and is become an habit, as it was in the persons here described, for it had its seat in their heart, they were habituated to it, and continually exercised it in a multitude of instances and wicked practices, is insatiable and damnable: <p>cursed children; or "children of the curse"; which may be understood either actively, children that do curse, as children of disobedience are such as commit acts of disobedience; so these were cursing children, who, though their mouths might not be full of cursing and bitterness, as openly profane sinners be, yet they inwardly, and from their hearts, cursed the true followers of Christ, and their principles; or passively, cursed children who were under the curse of the law, and from which there was no redemption for them, but at the last day will have the awful sentence pronounced on them, Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire. <p>(k) T.

The phrase is probably connected with a recollection of our Lord’s words as to the sin of looking on a woman, to lust after her, being equivalent to adultery (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Matthew 5:28</a>). St John’s mention of the “woman Jezebel” in the Church of Thyatira (<a href="/context/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols....">Revelation 2:20-22</a>) suggests the thought that there may have been some conspicuous woman of that type of character present to St Peter’s thoughts, who at once encouraged her followers to bring their dainties—even though they were things that had been sacrificed to idols,—to the <span class="ital">Agapae</span> of the Christian Church, and when they were there held them fascinated by her wanton beauty. The spell thus exercised is further described as causing a restlessness in evil. The eyes that were thus attracted could not “cease from sin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beguiling unstable souls</span>] The Greek word for “beguiling” may be noted as one of those which St Peter had in common with St James. It means primarily to “take with a bait, or in a snare,” and in <a href="/james/1-14.htm" title="But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.">James 1:14</a> is rightly rendered “enticed.” The idea suggested is that the false teachers attended the <span class="ital">Agapae</span> as seducers of the innocence of others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a heart they have exercised with covetous practices</span>] Better, <span class="bld">trained in covetousness</span>. The words have an adequate meaning if we take “covetousness” in its ordinary sense. Greed of gain as well as wantonness characterised the false teachers. (See note on <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2 Peter 2:3</a>.) In not a few instances, however, there is so close a connexion between the Greek word and sins of impurity (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>) that it is not unreasonable to see that meaning here also. The idiomatic use of the English phrase “taking advantage” of a woman’s weakness, presents a like association of thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cursed children</span>] Better, <span class="bld">children of a curse</span>. The Apostle falls back on the old Hebrew idiom of expressing character by the idea of sonship. So we have “children of obedience in <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1 Peter 1:14</a>. “Children of disobedience” (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>).

He uses it again in verse 18 of this chapter (comp. also <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>). The word for "unstable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here and in <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>. It is a word of peculiar significance in the mouth of St. Peter, conscious, as he must have been, of his own want of stability in times past. He would remember also the charge once given to him, "When thou art converted, strengthen (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) thy brethren" (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An heart they have exercised with covetous practices;</span> rather, <span class="accented">trained in covetousness</span>, according to the reading of the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.
