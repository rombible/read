Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>. These men are like dried-up watering-places in the desert, which entice and mock the thirsty traveller; perhaps leading him into danger also by drawing him from places where there is water. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.">Jeremiah 14:3</a>.) The parallel passage, <a href="/context/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12-13</a>, is much more full than the one before us, and is more like an amplification of this than this a condensation of that—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>would a simile so admirably suitable to false guides as “wandering stars” have been neglected by the writer of our Epistle? A Hebrew word which occurs only twice in the Old Testament is translated by the LXX. in the one place (<a href="/genesis/2-6.htm" title="But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.">Genesis 2:6</a>) by the word here used for “well,” and in the other (<a href="/job/36-27.htm" title="For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof:">Job 36:27</a>) by the word used in <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, for “cloud.” Thus the same Hebrew might have produced “wells without water” here and “clouds without water” in Jude. This is one of the arguments used in favour of a Hebrew original of both these Epistles. Coincidences of this kind, which may easily be mere accidents of language, must be shown to be numerous before a solid argument can be based upon them. Moreover, we must remember that the writers in both cases were Jews, writing in Greek, while thinking probably in Hebrew, so that the same Hebrew thought might suggest a different Greek expression in the two cases. When we have deducted all that might easily be accounted for in this way, and also all that is perhaps purely accidental, from the not very numerous instances of a similar kind that have been collected, we shall not find much on which to build the hypothesis of these Epistles being translations from Hebrew originals. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to Jude, </span>II.)<p><span class= "bld">Clouds that are carried with a tempest.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">mists driven by the storm-wind.</span> Wiclif has “myistis.” The words for “clouds” and “carried about” in <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, are quite different, so that our version creates a false impression of great similarity. The idea is not very different from that of the “wells without water.” These mists promise refreshment to the thirsty soil (<a href="/genesis/2-6.htm" title="But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.">Genesis 2:6</a>), and are so flimsy that they are blown away before they do any good. So these false teachers deceived those who were thirsting for the knowledge and liberty promised them by raising hopes which they could not satisfy.<p><span class= "bld">To whom the mist of darkness.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">for whom the gloom of darkness.</span> (See Note on <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>.) “For ever” is wanting in authority; the words have probably been inserted from the parallel passage in Jude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2 Peter 2:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">These are wells without water, </span>&c. — Pretenders to knowledge and piety, but really destitute thereof; <span class="ital">clouds </span>— Promising fertilizing showers of instructive and edifying doctrine, but yielding none; <span class="ital">carried with a tempest </span>— Driven by the violence of their own lusts from one error and vice to another; <span class="ital">to whom the mist </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ο ζοφος</span>, <span class="ital">the blackness; of darkness is reserved for ever </span>— Eternal darkness.

By these comparisons the ostentation, hypocrisy, levity, and mischief of the false teachers are set forth in the strongest colours.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:17-22 The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls that receive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forth as empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backsliding a grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are wells without water - Jde 1:12-13 employs several other epithets to describe the same class of persons. The language employed both by Peter and Jude is singularly terse, pointed, and emphatic. Nothing to an oriental mind would be more expressive than to say of professed religious teachers, that they were "wells without water." It was always a sad disappointment to a traveler in the hot sands of the desert to come to a well where it was expected that water might be found, and to find it dry. It only aggravated the trials of the thirsty and weary traveler. Such were these religious teachers. In a world, not unaptly compared, in regard to its real comforts, to the wastes and sands of the desert, they would only grievously disappoint the expectations of all those who were seeking for the refreshing influences of the truths of the gospel. There are many such teachers in the world.<p>Clouds that are carried with a tempest - Clouds that are driven about by the wind, and that send down no rain upon the earth. They promise rain, only to be followed by disappointment. Substantially the same idea is conveyed by this as by the previous phrase. "The Arabs compare persons who put on the appearance of virtue, when yet they are destitute of all goodness, to a light cloud which makes a show of rain, and afterward vanishes" - Benson. The sense is this: The cloud, as it rises, promises rain. The expectation of the farmer is excited that the thirsty earth is to be refreshed with needful showers. Instead of this, however, the wind "gets into" the cloud; it is driven about, and no rain falls, or it ends in a destructive tornado which sweeps everything before it. So of these religious teachers. Instruction in regard to the way of salvation was expected from them; but, instead of that, they disappointed the expectations of those who were desirous of knowing the way of life, and their doctrines only tended to destroy.<p>To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever - The word rendered "mist" here, (&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  zophos,) means properly muskiness, thick gloom, darkness, (see <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>); and the phrase "mist of darkness" is designed to denote "intense" darkness, or the thickest darkness. It refers undoubtedly to the place of future punishment, which is often represented as a place of intense darkness. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>. When it is said that this is "reserved" for them, it means that it is prepared for them, or is kept in a state of readiness to receive them. It is like a jail or penitentiary which is built in anticipation that there will be criminals, and with the expectation that there will be a need for it. So God has constructed the great prison-house of the universe, the world where the wicked are to dwell, with the knowledge that there would be occasion for it; and so he keeps it from age to age that it may be ready to receive the wicked when the sentence of condemnation shall be passed upon them. Compare <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>. The word "forever" is a word which denotes properly eternity, (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  eis aio&#772;na,) and is such a word as could not have been used if it had been meant that they would not suffer forever.

The Greek word for “tempest” is found also in the descriptions of the storm on the Sea of Galilee in <a href="/mark/4-27.htm" title="And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.">Mark 4:27</a>; <a href="/luke/8-23.htm" title="But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.">Luke 8:23</a>. Did St Peter’s mind go back to that scene, so that he saw, in the wild whirling mists that brought the risk of destruction, a parable of the storm of heresies by which the Church was now threatened? The imagery, it may be noted, is identical with that used by St Paul, when he speaks of men as “carried about by every wind of doctrine” (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever</span>] The two last words are omitted in some of the best MSS. and versions. For “mist” it would be better to read <span class="bld">blackness</span>, as in Jude, <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>. It is noticeable that the word had been used by Homer (<span class="ital">Il</span>. xv. 191) of the gloom of Hades, and so had probably come to be associated in common language with the thought of Tartarus, as it is here and in <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2 Peter 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὗτοί εἰσι</span>, <span class="ital">these are</span>) From <a href="/context/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

They are like wells without water; they deceive men with a promise which they do not fulfill. In <a href="/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a> there is a slight difference - "clouds without water" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clouds that are carried with a tempest;</span> better, <span class="accented">mists driven by a tempest.</span> The best manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, mists, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, clouds; they are driven along by the tempest; they give no water to the thirsty land, but only bring darkness and obscurity. The Greek word for "tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>) is used by St. Mark and St. Luke in their account of the tempest on the Sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for over;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the blackness of darkness.</span> The words are the same as those of <a href="/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a> (comp. verse 4 of this chapter; also <a href="/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; and <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where the same verb is used of the inheritance <span class="accented">reserved</span> in heaven for the saints).
