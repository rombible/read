The third instance of God’s vengeance is so prolonged by the addition respecting Lot, that the apodosis is wanting, the writer in his eagerness having lost the thread of the construction. The three instances here are in chronological order (wanton angels, Flood, Sodom and Gomorrha), while those in Jude are not (unbelievers in the wilderness, impure angels, Sodom and Gomorrha). Both arrangements are natural—this as being chronological, that of St. Jude for reasons stated in the Notes there. (See on <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The angels that sinned.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">the angels for their sin</span>: it gives the reason why they were not spared, and points to some definite sin. What sin is meant? Not that which preceded the history of the human race, commonly called the fall of the angels—of that there is no record in the Old Testament; and, moreover, it affords no close analogy to the conduct of the false teachers. St. Jude is somewhat more explicit (<a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>); he says it was for not keeping their own dignity—for deserting their proper home; and the reference, both there and here, is either to a common interpretation of <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm" title="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a> (that by “the sons of God” are meant “angels”), or, more probably, to distinct and frequent statements in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>that certain angels sinned by having intercourse with women—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Enoch vii. 1, 2; cv. 13 (Lawrence’s translation). Not improbably these false teachers made use of this book, and possibly of these passages, in their corrupt teaching. Hence St. Peter uses it as an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem</span> against them, and St. Jude, recognising the allusion, adopts it and makes it more plain; or both writers, knowing the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> well, and calculating on their readers knowing it also, used it to illustrate their arguments and exhortations, just as St. Paul uses the Jewish belief of the rock following the Israelites. (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Cast them down to hell.</span>—The Greek word occurs nowhere else, but its meaning is plain—<span class= "ital">to cast down to Tartarus</span>; and though “Tartarus” occurs neither in the Old nor in the New Testament, it probably is the same as Gehenna. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Into chains of darkness.</span>—Critical reasons seem to require us to substitute <span class= "ital">dens, </span>or <span class= "ital">caves, </span>for “chains.” The Greek words for “chains” and for “caves” here are almost exactly alike; and “caves” may have been altered into “chains” in order to bring this passage into closer harmony with <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>, although the word used by St. Jude for “chains” is different. (See Note there.) If “chains of darkness” be retained, comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/17-17.htm" title="For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.">Wisdom Of Solomon 17:17</a>. There still remains the doubt whether “into chains of darkness” should go with “delivered” or with “cast down into hell.” The former arrangement seems the better.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">For if </span>— Or <span class="ital">since, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ει γαρ </span>may be here rendered; <span class="ital">God spared not the angels that sinned — </span>“The angels seem to have been placed originally in a state of trial.

Perhaps it was handed down by tradition from Adam and Eve, for the memory of it seems to have been preserved among the heathens in the fable of the Titans warring against the gods. What the sin of the angels was is not well known. <a href="/judges/1-6.htm" title="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jdg 1:6</a>, says, <span class="ital">They kept not their first estate, </span>or <span class="ital">their own principality, </span>as <span class="greekheb">την εαυτων αρχην </span>may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">but left their proper habitation. </span>Hence their sin, by many, is thought to have been pride, and a discontent with their station. See <a href="/1_timothy/3-6.htm" title="Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.">1 Timothy 3:6</a>. But whatever it was, considering their high intellectual powers, they might easily have avoided it; and therefore God did not spare them, as he spared Adam and Eve, who, on account of the greatness of the temptation spread for them by the evil angels, and their own inexperience, were fit objects of mercy.” <span class="ital">But cast them down to hell</span> — The bottomless pit, a place of unknown misery. The original expression, <span class="greekheb">αλλα σειραις ζοφου Ταρταρωσας</span>, is rendered by Macknight, <span class="ital">But with chains of darkness confining them in Tartarus. </span>The word <span class="ital">Tartarus, </span>he observes, is not found in the LXX., nor anywhere in the New Testament but here. Its meaning, therefore, must be sought for among the Greeks. Homer represents Tartarus, <span class="ital">Iliad, 8. </span>ver. 13, as “a deep place under the earth, where there are iron gates and a brazen entrance.” It is derived from a word expressive of terror, and signifies the doleful prison in which wicked spirits are reserved till they shall be brought out to public condemnation and execution. In like manner, Hesiod speaks of Tartarus as a place far under ground, where the Titans are bound with chains in thick darkness. But on other occasions the Greek writers speak of Tartarus as in the air, and at the extremity of the earth. Hence the epithet <span class="greekheb">Ταρταρον ηεροεντα</span>, <span class="ital">airy Tartarus. </span>The Jews, as appears from <a href="/job/2-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.">Job 2:2</a>, thought that at least some of the fallen angels were permitted to wander up and down the earth, and to tempt men. This was the doctrine of the evangelists likewise, who speak of the devil tempting our Lord; and of Peter, who represents him as a roaring lion walking about, &c., <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1 Peter 5:8</a>; as also of St. Paul, who insinuates that evil spirits have their habitation in the air, <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil....">Ephesians 6:11-12</a>. Wherefore seeing the Greeks named the place where they supposed the Titans, the enemies of the gods, were confined, <span class="ital">Tartarus, </span>it was natural for Peter, when writing in the Greek language, concerning confining the evil angels in the place where they were shut up, to call it Tartarus, although his idea of Tartarus was different from that of the Greeks. Because it is said, <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm" title="And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.">Revelation 20:3</a>, that <span class="ital">Satan was cast, </span><span class="greekheb">εις αβυσσον</span>, <span class="ital">into the abyss, </span>and <a href="/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a>, that the devil besought Jesus <span class="ital">that he would not command them to go out, </span><span class="greekheb">εις αβυσσον</span>, <span class="ital">into the abyss, </span>Estius infers that <span class="ital">Tartarus </span>and <span class="ital">Hell </span>are the same; and that the greatest part of the angels who sinned are confined there, though some of them are allowed to roam about on the earth, tempting men. See Macknight and Doddridge. <span class="ital">Reserved unto judgment — </span>The full execution and open manifestation thereof. From this it follows that the angels who sinned are not at present suffering the punishment due to them for their crimes; but, like malefactors, they are kept in durance till the time come when they are to be punished with the wicked of mankind, whom they have seduced. Whitby hath shown that this was the opinion of all the Christian writers for five centuries. And it is agreeable to our Lord’s doctrine, who says, the fire into which wicked men are to be cast, is <span class="ital">fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if God spared not the angels that sinned - The apostle now proceeds to the proof of the proposition that these persons would be punished. It is to be remembered that they had been, or were even then, professing Christians, though they had really, if not in form, apostatized from the faith <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20-22</a>, and a part of the proofs, therefore, are derived from the cases of those who had apostatized from the service of God. He appeals, therefore, to the case of the angels that had revolted. Neither their former rank, their dignity, nor their holiness, saved them from being thrust down to hell; and if God punished them so severely, then false teachers could not hope to escape. The apostle, by the "angels" here, refers undoubtedly to a revolt in heaven - an event referred to in Jde 1:6, and everywhere implied in the Scriptures. When that occurred, however - why they revolted, or what was the number of the apostates - we have not the slightest information, and on these points conjecture would be useless. In the supposition that it occurred, there is no improbability; for there is nothing more absurd in the belief that angels have revolted than that men have; and if there are evil angels, as there is no more reason to doubt than that there are evil men, it is morally certain that they must have fallen at some period from a state of holiness, for it cannot be believed that God made them wicked.<p>But cast them down to hell - Greek &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  tartaro&#772;sas - "thrusting them down to Tartarus." The word here used occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though it is common in the Classical writers. It is a verb formed from &#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Tartaros, Tartarus, which in Greek mythology was the lower part, or abyss of Hades, &#x391;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  Hade&#772;s, where the shades of the wicked were supposed to be imprisoned and tormented, and corresponded to the Jewish word &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  Geenna - "Gehenna." It was regarded, commonly, as beneath the earth; as entered through the grave; as dark, dismal, gloomy; and as a place of punishment. Compare the <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a> notes, and <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a> note. The word here is one that properly refers to a place of punishment, since the whole argument relates to that, and since it cannot be pretended that the "angels that sinned" were removed to a place of happiness on account of their transgression. It must also refer to punishment in some other world than this, for there is no evidence that This world is made a place of punishment for fallen angels.<p>And delivered them into chains of darkness - "Where darkness lies like chains upon them" - Robinson, Lexicon. The meaning seems to be, that they are confined in that dark prisonhouse as if by chains. We are not to suppose that spirits are literally bound; but it was common to bind or fetter prisoners who were in dungeons, and the representation here is taken from that fact. This representation that the mass of fallen angels are confined in "Tartarus," or in hell, is not inconsistent with the representations which elsewhere occur that their leader is permitted to roam the earth, and that even many of those spirits are allowed to tempt men. It may be still true that the mass are con fined within the limits of their dark abode; and it may even be true also that Satan and those who axe permitted to roam the earth are under bondage, and are permitted to range only within certain bounds, and that they are so secured that they will be brought to trial at the last day.<p>To be reserved unto judgment - Jde 1:6, "to the judgment of the great day." They will then, with the revolted inhabitants of this world, be brought to trial for their crimes. That the fallen angels will be punished after the judgment is apparent from <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>. The argument in this verse is, that if God punished the angels who revolted from Him, it is a fair inference that He will punish wicked people, though they were once professors of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. if&#8212;The apodosis or consequent member of the sentence is not expressed, but is virtually contained in 2Pe 2:9.

Slaves of Tartarus (called "the abyss," or "deep," Lu 8:31; "the bottomless pit," Re 9:11) may also come upon earth. Step by step they are given to Tartarus, until at last they shall be wholly bound to it.<p>delivered&#8212;as the judge delivers the condemned prisoner to the officers (Re 20:2).<p>into chains&#8212;(Jude 6). The oldest manuscripts read, "dens," as Alford translates: the Greek, however, may, in Hellenistic Greek, mean "chains," as Jude expresses it. They are "reserved" unto hell's "mist of darkness" as their final "judgment" or doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is begun. So the ungodly were considered as virtually "in prison," though at large on the earth, from the moment that God's sentence went forth, though not executed till one hundred twenty years after.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell:</span> elsewhere called <span class="ital">the deep, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a></span>, and <span class="ital">the bottomless pit, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a> 11:7 17:8 20:1,3</span>.

The passage in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> seems most clearly of any to express their sin, which was "not abiding in the truth"; in the truth of the Gospel, particularly the great truth of the salvation of men, by the incarnate Son of God; and which they could by no means brook and which might spring from pride, they not bearing the thought that the human nature should be exalted above theirs; hence the Jews, in opposing Christ as the Messiah and Saviour, are said to be of their father the devil, and to do his lusts; and Judas that betrayed him, and fell from his apostleship, and the truth, is called a devil; and the heresies of men, respecting the person and office of Christ, are styled doctrines of devils; and men that have professed this truth, and afterwards deny it, are represented in the same irrecoverable and desperate case with devils, and must expect the same punishment, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, and also it may be observed on the contrary, that the good angels that stand, greatly love, value, esteem, and pry into the truths of the Gospel; particularly the scheme of man's salvation, by the incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death of Christ: now these <p>God spared not; or "had no mercy on", as the Arabic version renders it; he did not forgive their sin, nor provide a Saviour for them; but directly, and at once, notwithstanding the dignity and excellency of their nature, in strict justice, and awful severity, without any mercy, inflicted due punishment on them; wherefore it cannot be thought that false teachers, who, as they, abide not in the truth, but deny and oppose it, should escape the vengeance of God: <p>but cast them down to hell; they were hurled out of heaven, from whence they fell as lightning, into the "lowest", or inferior places, as the Syriac version renders it; either into the air, as in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a> or into the earth; as in <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> or into the deep, the abyss, the bottomless pit, where they are detained, as in a prison, <a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> though for certain reasons, and at certain times, are suffered to come forth, and rove about in this earth, and in the air: and these, when removed from their ancient seats in heaven, were not merely bid to go away, as the wicked will at the day of judgment; or were "drove" out, as Adam was from the garden of Eden; but "cast down"; with great power, indignation, wrath, and contempt, never to be raised and restored again: <p>and delivered them into chains of darkness: leaving them under the guilt of sin, which is the power of darkness, and in black despair; shutting them up in unbelief, impenitence, and hardness of mind; being holden with the cords of their sins, and in the most dreadful state of bondage and captivity to their lusts, in just judgment on them; and in the most miserable and uncomfortable condition, being driven from the realms of light, deprived of the face and presence of God, in the utmost horror and trembling, and fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to consume them; and in utter darkness, without the least glimmering of light, joy, peace, and comfort; and where there is nothing but weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and being also under the restraints of the power and providence of God, and not able to stir or move, or do anything without divine permission; and being likewise, by the everlasting, unalterable, and inscrutable purposes and decrees of God, appointed to everlasting wrath and destruction; by which they are consigned and bound over to it, and held fast, that they cannot escape it: <p>to be reserved unto judgment: to the day of judgment, to the last and general judgment; the judgment of torment, as the Syriac version here calls it; the words may be rendered, "and delivered them to be kept at judgment, in chains of darkness"; when they will be in full torment, which they are not yet in; and then they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for them, and be everlastingly shut up in the prison of hell from whence they will never more be suffered to go out; till which time they are indeed under restraints, and are held in by Christ, who has the power of binding and loosing them at pleasure; and who then, as the Judge of men and devils, will bring them forth, and pass and execute sentence on them. The Jews give an account of the dejection, fall, and punishment of the angels, in a manner pretty much like this of Peter's, whom they speak of under different names; so of the serpent that deceived Adam and Eve, whom they call Samael, and because of that sin of his, they say (k) that the Lord <p>"cast down Samael and his company from the place of their holiness, out of heaven;'' <p>and of Aza and Azael, angels, who, they say, sinned by lusting after the daughters of men, they frequently affirm, that God cast them down from their holiness (l), and that he  , "cast them down below in chains" (m); and that God cast them down from their holiness from above; and when they descended, they were rolled in the air--and he brought them to the mountains of darkness, which are called the mountains of the east, and bound them "in chains" of iron, and the chains were sunk into the midst of the great deep (n): and elsewhere they say (o), that God cast them down from their holy degree, out of heaven--from their holy place out of heaven--and bound them in "chains" of iron, in the mountains of "darkness". <p>(k) Sepher Bahir in Zohar in Gen. fol. 27. 3.((l) Zohar in Gen. fol. 25. 3.((m) lb. fol. 32. 3.((n) Midrash Ruth in Zohar in Gen. fol. 45. 1. 2. vid. fol. 77. 3.((o) Zohar in Numb. fol. 84. 1. vid.

(The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in the Septuagint, <a href="/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>. Compare also the Septuagint rendering of the name of Job's daughter Keren-Happuch, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the horn of Amalthaea; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>.) Apparently, St. Peter regards Tartarus not as equivalent to Gehenna, for the sinful angels are "reserved unto judgment," but as a place of preliminary detention. Josephus, quoted by Professor Lumby in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' speaks of the oldest heathen gods as fettered in Tartarus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ('Contra Apion,' 2:33). And delivered them into chains of darkness. The Revised Version "pits" represents the reading of the four oldest manuscripts; but the variations in two of them (the Sinaitic and Alexandrine have <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> seems properly to mean a pit for the storage of corn, throw some doubt upon this reading. The other reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, cords, may possibly have arisen from the parallel passage in <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, though the Greek word for "chains" is different there. The chains consist in darkness; the pits are in darkness, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, delivered, is often used, as Huther remarks, with the implied idea of punishment. It is simpler to connect the chains or pits of darkness with this verb than (as Fronmuller and others) with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having cast them in bonds of darkness into Tartarus" (comp. Wisd. 17:2, 16, 17). To be reserved unto judgment; literally, <span class="accented">being reserved</span>; but the readings here are very confused. St. Jude says (verse 6) that the sinful angels are reserved <span class="accented">"unto</span> the judgment of the great day." Bengel says, "Possunt autem in terra quoque versari mancipia Tartari (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; etc.) sic ut bello captus etiam extra locum captivitatis potest ambulare." But in the case of a mystery of which so little has been revealed, we are scarcely justified in assuming the identity of the angels cast into Tartarus with the evil spirits who tempt and harass us on earth. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The angels<p>No article.
