They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it.

That is, they regard all government in the state, the church, and the family, as an evil. Advocates for unbridled freedom of all sorts; declaimers on liberty and on the evils of oppression; defenders of what they regard as the rights of injured man, and yet secretly themselves lusting for the exercise of the very power which they would deny to others - they make no just distinctions about what constitutes true freedom, and in their zeal array themselves against government in all forms. No topic of declamation would be more popular than this, and from none would they hope to secure more followers; for if they could succeed in removing all respect for the just restraints of law, the way would be open for the accomplishment of their own purposes, in setting up a dominion ever the minds of others. It is a common result of such views, that men of this description become impatient of the government of God himself, and seek to throw off all authority, and to live in the unrestrained indulgence of their vicious propensities.<p>Presumptuous are they - &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  Tolme&#772;tai - daring, bold, audacious, presumptuous men.<p>Self-willed - &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  authadeis.

It is applied here to men of exalted rank; and the meaning is, that they did not regard rank, or station, or office - thus violating the plainest rules of propriety and of religion. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/23-4.htm">Acts 23:4-5</a>. Jude, between whose language and that of Peter in this chapter there is a remarkable resemblance, has expressed this more fully. He says, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-8.htm">2 Peter 2:8</a>, "These filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities." It is one of the effects of religion to produce respect for superiors; but when men are self-willed, and when they purpose to give indulgence to corrupt propensities, it is natural for them to dislike all government. Accordingly, it is by no means an unfrequent effect of certain forms of error to lead men to speak disrespectfully of those in authority, and to attempt to throw off all the restraints of law. It is a very certain indication that men hold wrong opinions when they show disrespect to those in authority, and despise the restraints of law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. chiefly&#8212;They especially will be punished (Jude 8).<p>after&#8212;following after.<p>lust of uncleanness&#8212;defilement: "hankering after polluting and unlawful use of the flesh" [Alford].<p>government&#8212;Greek, "lordship," "dominion" (Jude 8).<p>Presumptuous&#8212;Greek, "Darers."

On the contrary, they spoke lightly of the Unseen Powers generally. Their teaching seems to have been materialistic in tone. They were <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄλογα ζῷα γεγεννημένα φυσικὰ</span> (<a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2 Peter 2:12</a>)—creatures of natural instinct, not employing the higher powers of reason (<span class="greekheb">ἄλογα</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness</span>] Literally, in the lust of <span class="bld">defilement</span>, the genitive being either that of a characterising attribute, or implying that those of whom the writer speaks had fallen to a depth of baseness in which they seemed to desire impurity for its own sake, apart even from the mere pleasure of indulged appetite. (Comp. <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>.) In the parallel passage of Jude, <a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2 Peter 2:7</a>, we have the addition “going after strange flesh.” The Apostle seems to have in view the darker forms of impurity which were common throughout the Roman Empire (<a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:...">Romans 1:24-28</a>).

The last word may be used like “principalities” and “powers,” as including all forms of the dignity that gives glory, but the context seems to shew that it also is used with special reference to angels. This passage, with the parallel in Jude, <a href="/context/2_peter/2-8.htm" title="(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)...">2 Peter 2:8-9</a>, suggests the inference that the undue “worshipping of angels” in the Judaizing Gnosticism which had developed out of the teaching of the Essenes (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>) had been met by its more extreme opponents with coarse and railing mockery as to all angels whether good or evil, and that the Apostle felt it necessary to rebuke this licence of speech as well as that which paid no respect to human authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

There is a further reference to the same two subjects (heads) at <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a> : <span class="ital">swelling: they entice</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κυριότητος καταφρονοῦντας</span>, <span class="ital">despising government</span>) In this, which is the statement or proposition, he makes mention of <span class="ital">government:</span> shortly afterwards, in handling the subject, he speaks of <span class="ital">dignities</span> (<span class="greekheb">δόξας</span>), including the signification of the one in that of the other. Each of these, by an impressive Metonymia of the abstract for the concrete, seems to signify the angels, and those the fallen ones (although Horne on the Epistle of Jude takes it of the holy angels): for while it is here asserted, <a href="/2_peter/2-11.htm" title="Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.">2 Peter 2:11</a>, that <span class="ital">railing judgment</span> is not to be brought by angels against <span class="ital">dignities</span>, Jude, <a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2 Peter 2:9</a>, to the same purport, but in more definite language, asserts that this same railing judgment was not brought by the archangel against <span class="ital">the devil</span>.

At least Jude also (<a href="/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Judges 1:8</a>) retains the singular and the plural: <span class="ital">they despise government, but speak evil of dignities</span>.

The angels who sinned, still, as the creatures of God, have a goodness, as Gerh. says on this passage, and in their exalted nature, which they received from the Creator, retain the indelible impress of majesty: comp. <a href="/context/luke/10-18.htm" title="And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven....">Luke 10:18-19</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-26.htm" title="And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?">Matthew 12:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; and this we ought to regard with reverence, not on their account, but on account of God.
