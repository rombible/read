As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised.

Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity - When they make pretensions to wisdom and learning, or seem to attach great importance to what they say, and urge it in a pompous and positive manner. Truth is simple, and delights in simple statements. It expects to make its way by its own intrinsic force, and is willing to pass for what it is worth. Error is noisy and declamatory, and hopes to succeed by substituting sound for sense, and by such tones and arts as shall induce men to believe that what is said is true, when it is known by the speaker to be false.<p>They allure through the lusts of the flesh - The same word is used here which in <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a> is rendered "beguiling," and in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a> "enticed." It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means that they make use of deceitful arts to allure, ensnare, or beguile others. The "means" which it is here said they employed, were "the lusts of the flesh;" that is, they promised unlimited indulgence to the carnal appetites, or taught such doctrines that their followers would feel themselves free to give unrestrained liberty to such propensities. This has been quite a common method in the world, of inducing people to embrace false doctrines.<p>Through much wantonness - See the notes at <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>. The meaning here is, that they made use of every variety of lascivious arts to beguile others under religious pretences. This has been often done in the world; for religion has been abused to give seducers access to the confidence of the innocent, only that they might betray and ruin them. It is right that for all such the "mist of darkness should be reserved forever;" and if there were not a place of punishment prepared for such men, there would be defect in the moral administration of the universe.<p>Those that were clean escaped from them who live in error - Margin, "for a little while." The difference between the margin and the text here arises from a difference of reading in the Greek. Most of the later editions of the Greek Testament coincide with the reading in the margin, (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  oligo&#772;s,) meaning "little, but a little, scarcely." This accords better with the scope of the passage; and, according to this, it means that they had "almost escaped" from the snares and influences of those who live in error and sin. They had begun to think of their ways; they had broken off many of their evil habits; and there was hope that they would be entirely reformed, and would become decided Christians, but they were allured again to the sins in which they had so long indulged. This seems to me to accord with the design of the passage, and it certainly accords with what frequently occurs, that those who are addicted to habits of vice become apparently interested in religion, and abandon many of their evil practices, but are again allured by the seductive influences of sin, and relapse into their former habits. In the case referred to here it was by professedly religious teachers - and is this never done now? Are there none for example, who have been addicted to habits of intemperance, who had been almost reformed, but who are led back again by the influence of religious teachers? Not directly and openly, indeed, would they lead them into habits of intemperance. But, when their reformation is begun, its success and its completion depend on total abstinence from all that intoxicates. In this condition, nothing more is necessary to secure their entire reformation and safety than mere abstinence; and nothing more may be necessary to lead them into their former practices than the example of others who indulge in moderate drinking, or than the doctrine inculcated by a religious teacher that such moderate drinking is not contrary to the spirit of the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. allure&#8212;Greek, "lay baits for."<p>through&#8212;Greek, "in"; the lusts of the flesh being the element IN which they lay their baits.<p>much wantonness&#8212;Greek, "by licentiousness"; the bait which they lay.<p>clean escaped&#8212;Greek, "really escaped."

Wiesinger and Hofmann understand it only of measure, equivalent to “little;” Hofmann understands it of space: “they are a little way escaped from those who walk in error.” The pres. of the verb shows that they are, as it were, still in the act of flight from their former condition, and are not yet firmly established in the new; cf. <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2 Peter 2:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">ψυχὰς ἀστηρίκτους</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἐν πλάνῃ ἀναστρεφομένους</span>] not an adjunct co-ordinate with what goes before; Luther: “and now walk in error;” but the accus. is dependent on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΦΕΎΓΟΝΤΑς</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ἘΝ ΠΛΆΝῌ ἈΝΑΣΤΡΕΦΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> are those from whom the persons who are being seduced have separated themselves, those who are not Christians, especially the heathen, who lead a life <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΛΆΝῌ</span></span></span> (Wiesinger, Schott, Brückner, Fronmüller, Hofmann); Steinfass incorrectly understands by the expression the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕΥΔΟΔΙΔΆΣΚΑΛΟΙ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] Bengel: Puteus et nubes aquam pollicentur; sic illi praegrandia jactant, quasi lumina ecclesiae; sed hi putei, hae nubes nil praebent; praegrandia illa sunt vanitatis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_peter/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρογκα</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>.

It indicates what we should call the “high-flown” character of the language of the false teachers. “Vanity” is used in its proper sense of “emptiness.” There was no substance below their show of a transcendental knowledge. Here again we trace a parallel with St Paul’s language, “Knowledge puffeth up” (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

A possible construction of the sentence would be to take the last clause in the Greek in apposition with the first, “those that had partially escaped, those that live in error,” but the English version gives a preferable meaning. In the verb for “live” we have a cognate form of St Peter’s favourite word for “conversation” or “conduct” (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1 Peter 1:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;...">1 Peter 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1 Peter 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σαρκὸς ἀσελγείας</span>) <span class="greekheb">Σὰρξ ἀσελγείας</span> is <span class="ital">most polluted flesh</span>.

Instead of <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγως</span>, some read <span class="greekheb">ὄντως</span>[12]. The copyists with equal readiness hastily put either of these words for the other. The compound verb <span class="greekheb">ἀποφεύγειν</span> has of itself such force, that even without the adverb <span class="greekheb">ὄντως</span>, it denotes those who <span class="ital">truly escape</span>, <a href="/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2 Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2 Peter 1:4</a>; but <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγως</span>, for a short time, added to the verb, adds remarkably to the sense of the passage. <span class="ital">No sooner</span> have some escaped from those who live in error, than these wretched men are afresh ensnared by them.

The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> may be understood of time, or, perhaps better, of measure - "escaping by a little, a little way." Those who were "clean escaped "would not be so easily enticed by the false teachers. These are only beginning to escape; they have heard the word with joy, but have no root in themselves; they put their hand to the plough, but they look back. They "that live in error" are the heathen; the unhappy men who are led astray by the false teachers are just escaping from the heathen and from their mode of life. It is possible to understand these last words as a coordinate clause, a further description of those who are just escaping. The false teachers entice "those who are just escaping, those who live in error." But the common rendering seems better.
