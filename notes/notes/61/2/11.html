This verse, if it refers to the same incident as <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, seems at first sight to tell somewhat in favour of the priority of Jude; for then, only when compared with <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, does it become intelligible. The inference is that this is an abbreviation of Jude, rather than Jude an amplification of this. But (1) such an inference is at best only probable. The writer of this Epistle might possibly count on his readers at once understanding his allusion to a tradition that may have been well known, while St. Jude thought it best to point out the allusion more plainly. (2) It is possible that the contest alluded to is not that between Satan and Michael about the body of Moses, but that between Satan and the angel of the Lord about Joshua the high priest (<a href="/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>). (3) It is also possible that it does not refer to any contest with Satan at all, but merely to angels not denouncing these false teachers before God, but leaving them to His judgment. If either (2) or (3) is correct, the argument for the priority of Jude falls to the ground. If (1) is right, then the argument really favours the priority of 2 Peter; for if the author of 2 Peter had Jude before him (and this is maintained by those who contend for the priority of Jude), and wished to make use of St. Jude’s illustration, why should he so deface St. Jude’s statement of it as to make it almost unintelligible? The reason suggested is altogether inadequate—that reverential feelings made him wish to avoid mentioning Michael’s name—a name that every Jew was perfectly familiar with in the Book of Daniel.<p><span class= "bld">Greater in power and might.</span>—This is taken in two ways—either “greater than these audacious, self-willed men,” which is the simpler and more natural explanation; or “greater than other angels,” as if it were a periphrasis for “archangels,” which is rather awkward language. But either explanation makes good sense.<p><span class= "bld">Railing accusation against them.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">a railing judgment.</span> Wiclif has “doom,” all the rest “judgment” both superior to “accusation.” “Against them,” if the reference is either to the contest about the body of Moses or to <a href="/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>, must mean against “dignities,” and “dignities” must here mean <span class= "ital">fallen</span> angels, who are considered still to be worthy of reverence on account of their original glory and indefectible spiritual nature. The position is, therefore, that what angels do not venture to say of devils, this, and worse than this, these audacious men dare to say of angels and other unseen powers. But “against them” may possibly mean “against the false teachers,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>they speak evil of angels, yet the angels bring no denunciation against them, but leave all judgment to God (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35-36</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord.

Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it.

It is not known precisely to what Peter alludes here, nor on what the statement here is based. There can be little doubt, however, as Benson has remarked, that, from the strong resemblance between what Peter says and what Jude says, Jde 1:9-10, there is allusion to the same thing, and probably both referred to some common tradition among the Jews respecting the contention of the archangel Michael with the devil about the body of Moses. See the notes at Jde 1:9. As the statement in Jude is the most full, it is proper to explain the passage before us by a reference to that; and we may suppose that, though Peter uses the plural term, and speaks of "angels," yet that he really had the case of Michael in his eye, and meant to refer to that as an example of what the angels do. Whatever may have been the origin of this tradition, no one can doubt that what is here said of the angels accords with probability, and no one can prove that it is not true.<p>Which are greater in power and might - And who might, therefore, if it were in any case proper, speak freely of things of an exalted rank and dignity. It would be more becoming for them than for men. On this difficult passage, see the notes at Jde 1:9.<p>Bring not railing accusation - They simply say, "The Lord rebuke thee," Jde 1:9. Compare <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>. The Greek here is, "bring not blasphemous or reproachful judgment, or condemnation" -  &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  blasphe&#772;mon krisin. They abhor all scurrility and violence of language; they simply state matters as they are. No one can doubt that this accords with what we should expect of the angels; and that if they had occasion to speak of those who were opposers, it would be in a calm and serious manner, not seeking to overwhelm them by reproaches.<p>Against them - Margin, "against themselves." So the Vulgate. The more correct reading is "against them;" that is, against those who might be regarded as their adversaries, Jde 1:9, or those of their own rank who had done wrong - the fallen angels.<p>Before the Lord - When standing before the Lord; or when represented as reporting the conduct of evil spirits. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>. This phrase, however, is missing in many manuscripts.

Judgment belongs to God, not the angels. How great is the dignity of the saints who, as Christ's assessors, shall hereafter judge angels! Meanwhile, railing judgments, though spoken with truth, against dignities, as being uttered irreverently, are of the nature of "blasphemies" (Greek, 1Co 4:4, 5). If superior angels dare not, as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of the bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil blasphemously of good "dignities." 2Sa 16:7, 8, Shimei; Nu 16:2, 3, Korah, &c., referred to also in Jude 11; Nu 12:8, "Were ye (Aaron and Miriam) not afraid to speak evil of My servant Moses?" The angels who sinned still retain the indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still "a strong man": "prince of this world"; and under him are "principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world." We are to avoid irreverence in regard to them, not on their account, but on account of God. A warning to those who use Satan's name irreverently and in blasphemy.

In the “railing” accusation, we have a distinct reference to the “reviling” or “speaking evil” of the previous verse. The Vulgate rendering “non portant adversus se execrabile judicium” is probably meant to convey the sense “against each other,” but it has been strangely interpreted by Lyra and other Roman Catholic commentators as meaning that as “evil angels cannot endure the accursed doom that falls on them from the Lord,” how much less will ungodly men be able to endure it.

Judgment belongs to God, not to angels.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Lord.</span> The conjunction is <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, literally, "where" - they speak evil of glories, "where," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "in which case." The literal rendering of the following words, "angels being greater," makes it probable that the comparison is with the false teachers of the previous verse rather than with the "glories." The false teachers rail at glories, where angels, though greater than they, bring not a railing judgment against those glories. It seems certain that the words "against them" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must refer to the "glories," and cannot mean, according to the Vulgate, <span class="accented">adversum se.</span> Men rail at these glories; but the elect angels, when they are commissioned to proclaim or inflict the just judgment (for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "judgment," not" accusation") of God upon the angels that sinned, the fallen glories, do not rail; they remember what those lost spirits once were, and speak solemnly and sorrowfully, not in coarse, violent language. The apostle may be alluding to <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>, but the resemblance to <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8, 9</a> is so dose that this last passage must have been in his thoughts, even if he is not directly referring to the dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil. Luther's interpretation (adopted by Fronmuller and others), that the <span class="accented">wicked</span> angels are not able to bear the judgment of God upon their blasphemy, cannot be extracted from the words. The Alexandrine Manuscript omits "before the Lord;" but these words are well supported. The angels of judgment remember that they are in the presence of God, and perform their solemn duty with godly fear. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Power and might (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b9;&#836; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., might and power. The radical idea of &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied: might which inheres in physical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an army' which appears in the resistance of physical organisms, as the earth, against which one dashes himself in vain: which dwells in persons or things, and gives them influence or value: which resides in laws or punishments to make them irresistible. This sense comes out clearly in the New Testament in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength" (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>): "according to the working of his mighty power" (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>). So the kindred adjective &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. "A strong man" (<a href="/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>): a mighty famine (<a href="/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14</a>): his letters are powerful (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>): a strong consolation (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>): a mighty angel (<a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>). Also the verb &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;. "It is good for nothing" (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>): "shall not be able" (<a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>): "I can do all things" (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>): "availeth much" (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p>&#x394;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is rather ability, faculty: not necessarily manifest, as &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;: power residing in one by nature. Thus ability (<a href="/matthew/25-15.htm">Matthew 25:15</a>): virtue (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a>): power (<a href="/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29</a>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>): "strength of sin" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>). So of moral vigor. "Strengthened with might in the inner man" (<a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>): "with all might (<a href="/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>). It is, however, mostly power in action, as in the frequent use of &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; for miracles, mighty works, they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus "power unto salvation" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>): the kingdom coming in power" (<a href="/mark/9-1.htm">Mark 9:1</a>): God himself called power -  "the right hand of the power" (<a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>), and so in classical Greek used to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the angelic powers (<a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>). Generally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; the inward, spiritual or moral virtue. Plato ("Protagoras," 350) draws the distinction thus: "I should not have admitted that the able (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;) are strong (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;), though I have admitted that the strong are able. For there is a difference between ability (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) and strength (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;). The former is given by knowledge as well as by madness or rage; but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body. Aristotle ("Rhet.," i., 5) says "strength (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;) is the power of moving another as one wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or pushing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;) is strong for all or for some of these things."<p>Railing judgment<p>Compare Jde 1:9; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>, <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>. </body></html>
