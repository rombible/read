These ungodly men were like the unbelievers in the wilderness in denying Christ and scoffing at His promises; they were like the impure angels in leaving that “constitution which is in heaven” (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title2="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>) for the base pleasures of earth; they were like the people of Sodom in seeking even these base pleasures by unnatural courses.<p><span class= "bld">These filthy dreamers.</span>—We must add <span class= "ital">also.</span> “Filthy” is not in the original Greek, nor in any previous English version, but is supplied from the next clause; not rightly, for “dreamers” goes with all three clauses, not with “defile the flesh” only.

St. Jude perhaps has this passage in his mind. (See below, second Note on <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>.) “Dreamers” may perhaps refer to the empty speculations of these men.<p><span class= "bld">Defile the flesh.</span>—Like the inhabitants of the cities of the plain.

In the Old Testament Michael appears as the guardian angel of the people of Israel, <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm" title2="But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.">Daniel 10:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm" title2="And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.">Daniel 12:1</a>; in the New Testament he is mentioned only here and in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm" title2="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>. In the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> his meekness is spoken of; he is “the merciful, <span class= "ital">the patient, </span>the holy Michael,” Enoch 40:8.<p><span class= "bld">He disputed about the body of Moses</span>.—To be understood quite literally: to make “the body of Moses” into a metaphor for the people of Israel, or the Mosaic law, is most unnatural. This passage is the only evidence extant of any such incident or tradition. The nearest approach to it is the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm" title2="And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>, which says that Michael was the appointed guardian of Moses’ grave. According to Origen (<span class= "ital">De Princip.</span> III. ii. 1) the source of it is a book called the <span class= "ital">Ascension, </span>or <span class= "ital">Assumption of Moses.</span> Evidently it is something supposed to be well known to those whom St. Jude is addressing, and it appears to be given as a fact which he believes, though we cannot be sure of this. In any case it does not follow that we are to believe in it as an historical fact. Reverent, and therefore cautious, theories of inspiration need not exclude the possibility of an unhistorical incident being cited as an illustration or a warning. St. Paul makes use of the Jewish legend of the rock following the Israelites in the wilderness as an illustration (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title2="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>). The strange question, “What did the devil want with the body of Moses?” has been asked, and answered in more ways than one:—(1) to make it an object of idolatry, as the Israelites would be very likely to worship it; (2) to keep it as his own, as that of a murderer, because Moses killed the Egyptian (<a href="/exodus/2-12.htm" title2="And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.">Exodus 2:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Durst not . . .</span>—Out of respect to Satan’s original angelic nature. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title2="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1Corinthians 6:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A railing accusation</span>.—More literally, <span class= "ital">a sentence savouring of evil-speaking.</span> Wiclif, “doom”; Tyndale and Cranmer, “sentence”; Rheims, “judgment.” Michael brought no sentence against the devil, but left all judgment to God.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord rebuke thee</span>.—The same rebuke <span class= "ital">is</span> administered to Satan by the angel of Jehovah, when Satan appears as the adversary of Joshua the high priest, the restorer of the temple and of the daily sacrifice, and one of the Old Testament types of Christ (<a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title2="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>). It is probable that the tradition here given by St. Jude is derived from this passage in Zechariah, or from a source common to both. We have another reminiscence of <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title2="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a> in <a href="/jude/1-23.htm" title2="And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.">Jude 1:23</a>.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">But these . . .</span>—In strong contrast to the scrupulous reverence of the archangel. “Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.”<p><span class= "bld">Those things which they know not.</span>—The “dignities” of <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>. This shows that unseen spiritual powers are there meant: these men would know earthly rulers. It is on the unseen that they show their irreverence.<p><span class= "bld">What they know naturally.</span>—The means of gratifying their desires. The two halves of the verse are in emphatic contrast. What they do not know, and cannot know, they abuse by gross irreverence: what they know, and cannot help knowing, they abuse by gross licentiousness. If this Epistle is prior to 2 Peter it is strange that the author of the latter should have neglected so telling an antithesis, and should (from a literary point of view) have so spoiled the passage by his mode of adaptation (<a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title2="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>). If 2 Peter is prior there is nothing strange in St. Jude improving upon the mode of expression. The word for “know” is not the same in both clauses. The word used in “which they know not” is the most general and common word of the kind in Greek, expressing mere perception, and occurring about three hundred times in the New Testament; that used in “what they know naturally” is more definite, and expresses practical experience productive of skill and science; it occurs fourteen times in the New Testament, mostly in the Acts. (Comp. “Paul I know,” <a href="/acts/19-15.htm" title2="And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?">Acts 19:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They corrupt themselves.</span>—Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">they work their own ruin.</span> Note the tense; not future, but present. The corruption, or <span class= "ital">ruin, </span>is not a judgment hanging over them; it is already going on.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 False teachers are dreamers; they greatly defile and grievously wound the soul. These teachers are of a disturbed mind and a seditious spirit; forgetting that the powers that be, are ordained of God, Ro 13:1. As to the contest about the body of Moses, it appears that Satan wished to make the place of his burial known to the Israelites, in order to tempt them to worship him, but he was prevented, and vented his rage in desperate blasphemy. This should remind all who dispute never to bring railing charges. Also learn hence, that we ought to defend those whom God owns. It is hard, if not impossible, to find any enemies to the Christian religion, who did not, and do not, live in open or secret contradiction to the principles of natural religion. Such are here compared to brute beasts, though they often boast of themselves as the wisest of mankind. They corrupt themselves in the things most open and plain. The fault lies, not in their understandings, but in their depraved wills, and their disordered appetites and affections. It is a great reproach, though unjust to religion, when those who profess it are opposed to it in heart and life. The Lord will remedy this in his time and way; not in men's blind way of plucking up the wheat with the tares. It is sad when men begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Twice dead; they had been once dead in their natural, fallen state; but now they are dead again by the evident proofs of their hypocrisy. Dead trees, why cumber they the ground! Away with them to the fire. Raging waves are a terror to sailing passengers; but when they get into port, the noise and terror are ended. False teachers are to expect the worst punishments in this world and in that to come. They glare like meteors, or falling stars, and then sink into the blackness of darkness for ever. We have no mention of the prophecy of Enoch in any other part or place of Scripture; yet one plain text of Scripture, proves any point we are to believe. We find from this, that Christ's coming to judge was prophesied of, as early as the times before the flood. The Lord cometh: what a glorious time will that be! Notice how often the word ungodly is repeated. Many now do not at all refer to the terms godly, or ungodly, unless it be to mock at even the words; but it is not so in the language taught us by the Holy Ghost. Hard speeches of one another, especially if ill-grounded, will certainly come into account at the day of judgment. These evil men and seducers are angry at every thing that happens, and never pleased with their own state and condition. Their will and their fancy, are their only rule and law. Those who please their sinful appetites, are most prone to yield to ungovernable passions. The men of God, from the beginning of the world, have declared the doom denounced on them. Such let us avoid. We are to follow men only as they follow Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Likewise also - In the same way do these persons defile the flesh, or resemble the inhabitants of Sodom; that is, they practice the same kind of vices.

The clause, "these men dreaming" (that is, in their dreams), belongs to all the verbs, "defile," "despise," and "speak evil." All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream (1Th 5:6, 7). Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of (Jude 10). "As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command.

These arise from the darkness of the understanding, and a spirit of slumber upon them; are the fictions of their own brain, and of their roving imagination; are illusory and deceitful, and are in themselves vanities, and like dreams pass away. And the dreamers of these dreams may be said to "defile the flesh"; since they appear to follow and walk after the dictates of corrupt nature; and because by their unclean practices, mentioned in the preceding verse, they defile the flesh, that is, the body: all sin is of a defiling nature, and all men are defiled with it; but these were notoriously so; and often so it is, that unclean practices follow upon erroneous principles, <p>Despise dominion; either the government of the world by God, denying or speaking evil of his providence; the Ethiopic version renders it, "they deny their own God", either his being, or rather his providence; or the dominion and kingly power of Christ, to which they cared not to be subject; or rather civil magistracy, which they despised, as supposing it to be inconsistent with their Christian liberty, and rejected it as being a restraint on their lusts; choosing rather anarchy and confusion, that they might do as they pleased, though magistracy is God's ordinance, and magistrates are God's representatives: <p>and speak evil of dignities; or "glories"; the Arabic version reads, "the God of glory": this is to be understood either of angels, those glorious creatures, called thrones, dominions, &amp;c. or ecclesiastical governors, who are set in the first and highest place in the church, and are the glory of the churches; or else civil magistrates, as before, who are the higher powers, and sit in high places of honour and grandeur.

This meaning does not here suit, for Bretschneider’s explanation: “falsis oraculis decepti vel falsa oracula edentes,” is wholly arbitrary. Most expositors unite it closely with the following <span class="greekheb">σάρκα μιαίνουσι</span>, and understand it either: de somniis, in quibus corpus polluitur (Vorstius), or of voluptuous dreams, appealing to <a href="/isaiah/56-10.htm" title2="His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.">Isaiah 56:10</a> (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐνυπνιαζόμενοι κοίτην</span>, an inaccurate translation of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">חֹזִים שֹׁכְבִים</span>), or of unnatural cohabiting (Oecumenius). Jachmann (with whom Brückner agrees) understands it generally = “sunk in sleep, i.e. hurried along in the tumult of the senses,” appealing to the parallel passage, <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ</span>). Similarly Calvin: est metaphorica loquutio, qua significat, ipsos tam esse habetes, ut sine ulla verecundia ad omnem turpitudinem se prostituant. But in all these explanations the expression is only referred to the first clause of the following sentence; but this is opposed to the construction: it refers to both clauses,—else it would have been put directly with <span class="greekheb">μιαίνουσι</span>,—and denotes the condition in which and out of which they do those things which are expressed in the following clauses. It is unsatisfactory to keep in view only the negative point of <span class="greekheb">ἐνυπνιάζεσθαι</span>, the want of a clear consciousness (Hornejus: tam insipientes sunt, ut quasi lethargo sopiti non tantum impure vivant, etc.; Arnaud: qui agissent sans savoir ce qu’ils font); the positive point is chiefly to be observed, which consists in living in the arbitrary fancies of their own perverted sense, which renders them deaf to the truths and warnings of the divine word (so in essentials, Stier, Fronmüller, Wiesinger, Schott, Brückner, Hofmann[25]). The reference to <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm" title2="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">πεπότικεν ὑμᾶς κύριος κατανύξεως</span>, is unsuitable (against Beza, Carpzov, and others), as here the discourse is not about a punitive decree of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σάρκα μὲν μιαίνουσι</span>] not <span class="ital">their</span> flesh, but generally <span class="ital">the flesh</span>, both their own and that of others: the thought refers back to <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title2="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Jude 1:7</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐκπορνεύσασαι</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κυριότητα δὲ ἀθετοῦσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">δόξας δὲ βλασφημοῦσιν</span>] announces a new side of their sinful nature. As this verse is in evident connection of thought with <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title2="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Jude 1:10</a>, where the words <span class="greekheb">ὅσα δὲ φυσικῶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">φθείρονται</span> refer back to <span class="greekheb">σάρκα μὲν μιαίν</span>., so <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> can only be here such things as suit the words <span class="greekheb">ὅσα οὐκ οἴδασιν</span>. It is thus incorrect to understand them of political powers (Erasmus, Calvin, Grotius, Wolf, Semler, Stier, and others), or of ecclesiastical rulers (Oecumenius[26]), or of human authorities generally, the two words being either taken as designations of concrete persons, or one of them as a pure abstraction: Arnaud: par <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗΤΑ</span></span></span> il faut entendre l’autorité en général et par <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑς</span></span></span> les dignités quelconques, les hommes méritant, par leur position, le respect et la considération.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both expressions are to be understood as a designation of supermundane powers. Almost all recent expositors agree in this, although they differ widely in the more definite statement. These different explanations are as follows:—(1) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> is taken as a designation of God or Christ, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span> as a designation of the good angels (Ritschl); (2) the good angels are understood in both expressions (Brückner); (3) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> is understood in the first explanation, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span> is explained of the evil angels (Wiesinger); (4) both expressions are understood as a designation of the evil angels (Schott). In order first correctly to determine the idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, the relation of <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a> to what goes before is to be observed. The judgments which have befallen the people (<a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>), the angels (<a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>), and the cities (<a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title2="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Jude 1:7</a>), are by Jude adduced as a testimony against the Antinomians (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὟΤΟΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a>) mentioned in <a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>, evidently because these persons are guilty of the same sins on account of which those judgments occurred. Since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΚΑ ΜΙΑΊΝΟΥΣΙ</span></span></span> evidently points back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΠΟΡΝΕΎΣΑΣΑΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title2="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Jude 1:7</a>, and further to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΣΈΛΓΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>, it is most natural to refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗΤΑ ἈΘΕΤΟῦΣΙΝ</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΠΙΣΤΕΎΟΝΤΑς</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>, and, further, to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΜΌΝΟΝ ΔΕΣΠΌΤΗΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἈΡΝΟΎΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>. Consequently, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>—if one takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΜΌΝΟΝ ΔΕΣΠΌΤΗΝ</span></span></span> as a designation of God—is to be understood the <span class="ital">Godhead</span>; or, if one understands <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. as a predicate to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΗΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΧΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, <span class="ital">Christ</span>. If, now, it is assumed that <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> is an idea corresponding to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, and to be taken along with it, then by it the good angels are to be understood. But it must not be overlooked that the clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑς ΔῈ ΒΛΑΣΦΗΜΟῦΣΙΝ</span></span></span> is separated from the preceding clause by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span>; and that <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a> leads to a different understanding of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span>. When in <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a> it is said of the archangel Michael that he dared not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΣΙΝ ἘΠΕΝΕΓΚΕῖΝ ΒΛΑΣΦΗΜΊΑς</span></span></span> against the <span class="ital">devil</span>, this <span class="greekheb">βλασφημίας</span> evidently refers back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΛΑΣΦΗΜΟῦΣΙΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a>, consequently the two ideas <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆΒΟΛΟς</span></span></span> are brought together, so that from this the preference must be given to the explanation which understands by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑς</span></span></span> the diabolical powers, or the <span class="ital">evil</span> angels. That not only <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span>, but also <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, is a designation of evil powers, Schott incorrectly appeals to the fact that in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a>, and also here, the unchaste, carnal life of the false teachers is connected with their despising or rejection of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>; for although it is presupposed that the recognition of the reverence for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> might restrain these men from the abuse of their fleshly nature, yet it does not follow from this that only evil spirits can be meant, since also the recognition of the reverence for the divine power restrains from the abuse of the corporeal senses which were created by God. To the identification of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span>—whether good or evil angels are to be understood—not only is the form of the expression opposed, Jude not uniting the two clauses by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, but, as already remarked, separating them by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span>,[27] but also the difference of the conduct of the Antinomians, whilst they despise (<span class="greekheb">ἀθετοῦσιν</span>; 2 Pet.: <span class="greekheb">καταφρονοῦσιν</span>) the <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span>, but blaspheme the <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span>. The clearer this separation and distinction are kept in view, the less reason is there against deriving the exact meaning of <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> from <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a> (<a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a> from <a href="/jude/1-11.htm" title2="And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:">Jude 1:11</a>), and consequently against understanding by it <span class="ital">evil</span> angels (comp. Hofmann); only it must not be affirmed that Jude has used the expression <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> as a <span class="ital">name</span> for the evil angels as such, but only that, whilst so naming angels generally, he here means the evil angels, as is evident from <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a>. That these may be understood by this designation cannot be denied, especially, as Wiesinger points out, as Paul in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a> names them <span class="greekheb">αἱ ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἱ ἐξουσίαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ κοσμοκράτορες</span>, and says of them that they are <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀθετοῦσιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦσιν</span>] The first expression is negative, the second positive; the Antinomians manifested the despising of <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> by the carnal licentiousness of their lives, whilst they fancied themselves exempt by <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> (<a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>) from the duty of obedience to the will of God (or Christ) as the <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span> requiring a holy life; but their blasphemy of the <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> consisted in this, that on the reproach of having in their immorality fallen under diabolical powers, they mocked at them as entirely impotent beings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[25] “Those here spoken of are wakeful dreamers, so that they, when they should perceive with their wakeful senses, have only dreams, and what they dream they esteem as the perception of the wakeful spirit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] Oecumenius, however, wavers, thinking that by <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> may also be understood <span class="greekheb">ἡ τοῦ κατὰ Χριστὸν μυστηρίου τελετή</span>, and by <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> also <span class="greekheb">ἡ παλαία διαθήκη καὶ ἡ νέα</span>; on <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a> he observes: <span class="greekheb">δόξας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἤτοι τὰς θείας φησὶ δυνάμεις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ καὶ τὰς ἐκκλησιαστικὰς ἀρχάς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] Also in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Jude 1:7</a>), and his expressions can therefore only be understood in an indirect and metaphorical sense. To this conclusion Ritschl arrives (1) by explaining the second clause of <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title2="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Jude 1:10</a>, that the Antinomians understood relations to be understood spiritually <span class="greekheb">φυσικῶς ὡς τὰ ἄλογα ζῶα</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> that they considered the blessings promised in the kingdom of heaven as the blessings of sensual enjoyment; (2) by so understanding the relation of <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a> to the preceding, that <span class="greekheb">δόξας βλασφ</span>. is to be referred back to <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title2="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me.

On first reading one is inclined to take the words <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span> simply as abstractions. The result of indulgence in degrading lusts is the loss of reverence, the inability to recognise true greatness and due degrees of honour. This would agree with the description of the libertines as sharing in the <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλογία</span> of Korah, as <span class="greekheb">κύματα ἄγρια θαλάσσης</span>, as <span class="greekheb">γογγυσταί</span> uttering hard speeches against God. When we examine however the use of the word <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> and the patristic comments, and when we consider the reference to the archangel’s behaviour towards Satan, and the further explanation in <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title2="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Jude 1:10</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span> of <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a> is represented by <span class="greekheb">ὅσα φυσικῶς ἐπίστανται</span>, and the phrase <span class="greekheb">κυριότητα ἀθετοῦσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">δόξας δὲ βλασφημοῦσιν</span> by <span class="greekheb">ὅσα οὐκ οἴδασιν βλασφημοῦσιν</span>, we seem to require a more pointed and definite meaning, not simply “majesty,” but “the divine majesty,” not simply “dignities,” but “the angelic orders”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

In our text, however, it would seem that the word should be understood as expressing the attribute of the true <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>, cf. <span class="ital">Didache</span>, iv. 1 (honour him who speaks the word of God), <span class="greekheb">ὡς κύριον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅθεν γὰρ ἡ κυριότης λαλεῖται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ κύριός ἐστιν</span>, Herm. <span class="ital">Sim</span>, <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="/jude/1-1.htm" title2="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Jude 1:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς δούλου τρόπον οὐ κεῖται ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἰς ἐξουσίαν μεγάλην κεῖται καὶ κυριότητα</span>.

For the former we may refer to <a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν ἀρνούμενοι</span>, for the latter to the contempt shown by the Israelites towards the commandments of God. So the desertion of their appointed station and abode by the angels showed their disregard for the divine ordinance, and the behaviour of the men of Sodom combined with the vilest lusts an impious irreverence towards God’s representatives, the angels (<a href="/genesis/19-5.htm" title2="And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.">Genesis 19:5</a>). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> i. 11. 2, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀνθρώπους ἦσαν ὑβρισταὶ καὶ πρὸς τὸ θεῖον ἀσεβεῖς</span>, and <span class="ital">Test.

The only other passage in the N.T. in which the plural occurs is <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title2="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>, where the sense is different. Dr. Bigg compares <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm" title2="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">τίς ὅμοιός σοι ἐν θεοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριε</span>; <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁμοιός σοι</span>; <span class="greekheb">δεδοξασμένος ἐν ἁγίοις</span>, <span class="greekheb">θαυμαστὸς ἐν δόξαις</span>. Clement’s interpretation of this and the preceding clause is as follows: (<span class="ital">Adumbr.</span> 1008) “dominationem spernunt, hoc est solum dominum qui vere dominus noster est, Jesus Christus … majestatem blasphemant, hoc est angelos”. The word <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> in the singular is used for the Shekinah, see my note on <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title2="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>. This suggests that Clement may be right in supposing the plural to be used for the angels, who are, as it were, separate rays of that glory. Compare Philo’s use of the name <span class="greekheb">λόγοι</span> for the angels as contrasted with the divine <span class="greekheb">Λόγος</span>. In Philo, <span class="ital">Monarch</span>, ii. p. 18 the divine <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, is said to consist of the host of angels, <span class="greekheb">δόξαν δὲ σὴν εἶναι νομίζω τάς σε δορυφορούσας δυνάμεις</span>. See <span class="ital">Test. <a href="/jude/1-25.htm" title2="And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.">Jude 1:25</a></span>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριος εὐλόγησε τὸν Λευί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ προσώπου ἐμέ</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἱ δυνάμεις τῆς δοξης τὸν Συμεών</span>, also <a href="/luke/9-26.htm" title2="For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.">Luke 9:26</a>, where it is said that “the Son of Man will come in His own glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels”.[790] Ewald, <span class="ital">Hist. Isr.</span> tr. vol. viii. p. 142, explains <span class="greekheb">ἡ κυριότης</span> of the true Deity, whom they practically deny by their dual God; <span class="greekheb">αἱ δόξαι</span> as the angels, whom they blaspheme by supposing that they had created the world in opposition to the will of the true God, whereas Michael himself submitted everything to Him. This last clause would then be an appendage to the preceding, with special reference to the case of the Sodomites (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/13-20.htm" title2="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">John 13:20</a>). There may also be some allusion to the teaching or practice of the libertines. If we compare the mysterious reference in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title2="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο ὀφείλει ἡ γυνὴ ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους</span>, which is explained by Tertullian (<span class="ital">De Virg. Vel.</span> 7) as spoken of the fallen angels mentioned by Jude, “propter angelos, scilicet quos legimus a Deo et caelo excidisse ob concupiscentiam feminarum,” we might suppose the <span class="greekheb">βλασφημία</span>, of which the libertines were guilty, to consist in a denial or non-recognition of the presence of good angels in their worship, or of the possibility of their own becoming <span class="greekheb">κοινωνοὶ δαιμονίων</span>; or they may have scoffed at the warnings against the assaults of the devil, or even at the very idea of “spiritual wickedness in high places”. So understood, it prepares us for the strange story of the next verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[790] There is much said of the glory of the angels in <span class="ital">Asc.

This meaning, however, does not lie in the word itself, and as the participle is, by the construction of the sentence, equally connected with all of the three verbs that follow, it is better to see in it a simple description of the dreaming, visionary character of the false teachers. They lived, as it were, in a dream (perhaps exulted in their clairvoyant visions), and the result was seen in impurity like that of the cities of the plain, in “despising dominion” and “speaking evil of dignities.” On the questions presented by the two last clauses, see notes on <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

A man in dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and hearing many things, etc. His lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-control in such a state: but as is an image (phantom) arising out of an image, such is the condition of such men. Hence, though they bring into play all the sinews of reason, they cannot conceive that the sons of light. who are awake and in the daylight, enjoy true liberty.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Having set in the forefront of his warnings these terrible instances of gross sin and overwhelming penalty, the writer proceeds to deal with the real character of the insidious troublers and corrupters of the Churches of his time. He describes them as <span class="cmt_word">filthy dreamers;</span> or better, as the Revised Version puts it, <span class="accented">men in their dreamings</span> - an expression pointing to the foul and perverted fancies in the service of which they lived. He charges them with the particular sins of defiling the flesh, despising dominion, and railing at dignities. He further declares of them that, in practicing such sins, they run a course like that of the cities of the plain, and run it in defiance, too, of the warning held forth to them by the case of Sodom and Gomorrah. For such seems the point of the terms connecting this paragraph with the preceding, which are best rendered "nevertheless in like manner," or "yet in like manner" (Revised Version). The difficulty lies, however, in the description of their offences. What is intended by the charge that they <span class="cmt_word">defile the flesh</span> is obvious. But what is referred to in the other clauses, <span class="cmt_word">and set at naught dominion</span> (or, <span class="accented">lordship</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and rail at dignities</span> (or, <span class="accented">glories</span>), is far from clear. It has been supposed that a lawlessness is meant which expressed itself in contempt for all earthly authority, whether political or ecclesiastical. The whole scope of the passage, however, and the analogy of <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc., seem to point so decidedly to higher dignities than the earthly institutions of Church and State, that most interpreters now think that celestial lordship of some kind is in view. But of what kind? That of <span class="accented">God</span> and that of <span class="accented">good angels</span>, say some. That of <span class="accented">Christ</span> and that of <span class="accented">angels</span>, say others. Both clauses, say a third class of interpreters, refer to angels, both to good angels and to evil, or to good angels alone, or to evil angels alone, as the allusions are variously understood. Pointing to the particular word which is used here for "dominion" or "lordship," some contend that there is a definite reference to the dominion of <span class="accented">Christ</span>, the <span class="accented">Lord</span> distinctively so called. But the same word is used elsewhere (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>) of angels, while the term translated "dignities," or "glories," occurs again only in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>. If, therefore, any single kind of lordship is in view, we should conclude in favour of angelic dignities, and the authority of good angels in particular. But it may be that Jude uses the terms here in a general sense to cover all kinds of authority, especially celestial authority. This is favoured by the undefined expressions which meet us in the Petrine parallel (<a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc.). It is supported, too, by the consideration that in leveling three separate charges against the men, Jude has probably in view the three separate cases which he has just cited in verses 5-7. In which case the parallel between these latter and the men now described can naturally be only of a general kind. It is remarked by Professor Plumptre that the passage in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc. (see his Commentary), taken in connection with this one in Jude, suggests that "the undue worshipping of angels in the Judaizing Gnosticism which had developed out of the teaching of the Essenes (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), had been met by its most extreme opponents with coarse and railing mockery as to all angels, whether good or evil, and that the apostle felt it necessary to rebuke this license of speech as well as that which paid no respect to human authority." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/jude/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Yet (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Not rendered by A.

In the first two, and probably in the third, the reference is to angelic dignities. Some explain this passage and the one in Peter, of evil angels. In Colossians the term is used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teachers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these. Glories or dignities is used in this concrete sense only here and at <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>. </body></html>
