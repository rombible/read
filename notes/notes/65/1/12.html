The divisions are clearly marked, each section beginning with “These are” (<a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>; <a href="/jude/1-16.htm" title2="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>; <a href="/jude/1-19.htm" title2="These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.">Jude 1:19</a>).<p>(12-15) Description corresponding to Cain.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">These are the rocks in your feasts of charity, banqueting with you fearlessly</span> (see next Note); or, <span class= "ital">These are they who banquet together fearlessly, rocks in your feasts of charity.</span> The former is preferable. But in any case we must probably read <span class= "ital">rocks</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that on which those who meet them at your love-feasts will be wrecked (see Notes on <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title2="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-22</a>)—not “spots,” which is borrowed from <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. But it is just possible that as <span class= "ital">spiloi, </span>St. Peter’s word, may mean either “spots” or “rocks” (though most commonly the former), so St. Jude’s word (<span class= "ital">spilades</span>) may mean either “spots” or “rocks” (though almost invariably the latter). In an Orphic poem of the fourth century, <span class= "ital">spilades</span> means “spots “; but this is rather late authority for its use in the first century. Here “rocks” is the safer translation. St. Peter is dwelling on the sensuality of these sinners, and for him “spots” is the more obvious metaphor. St. Jude, in tracing an analogy between them and Cain, would be more likely to select “rocks.” These libertines, like Cain, turned the ordinances of religion into selfishness and sin: both, like sunken rocks, destroyed those who unsuspectingly approached them. On the difference of reading respecting the word for “feasts of charity,” or “love-feasts,” see Note on <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. Possibly the name <span class= "ital">Agapæ</span> for such feasts comes from this passage. Had it been common when St. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 11, he would probably have made a point of it; love-feasts in which there was no love. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-14.htm" title2="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.">1Peter 5:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Feeding themselves without fear.</span> “Without fear” goes better with “feasting with you”; but the Greek admits of either construction. “Feeding themselves” instead of the poorer members of the flock; whereas feeding the poor was one great object of the love-feasts. Others explain, “feeding themselves” (literally, <span class= "ital">pasturing themselves</span>) instead of waiting to be tended by the shepherds. The former is better, the scandal being similar to that described in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title2="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1Corinthians 11:21</a>. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm" title2="Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.">Isaiah 56:11</a>, which St. Jude may possibly have had in his mind; and see above, second Note on <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Clouds without water</span>.—Comp. <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm" title2="Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.">Proverbs 25:14</a>. The meaning is not that these men bring much food to the love-feasts and give nothing away: there is no longer any allusion to the love-feasts. Rather, these men are ostentatious generally, and yet do no good inflated and empty. (See on <a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2Peter 2:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Carried about of winds.</span>—More literally, <span class= "ital">borne past</span> (without giving any rain) <span class= "ital">by winds</span>; or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">driven out of their course</span> (and so showing their flimsiness) <span class= "ital">by winds.</span><p><span class= "bld">Trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit.</span>—There is no such strange contradiction in the Greek, nor in any of the earlier English versions. The meaning rather is, <span class= "ital">autumn trees</span> (which ought to be full of fruit, and yet are) <span class= "ital">without fruit</span>; in allusion, probably, to the barren fig-tree. Others, less simply, explain “trees in <span class= "ital">late</span> autumn”—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, stripped and bare. But for this we should expect “winter trees” rather than “autumn trees.”<p><span class= "bld">Twice dead.</span>—Utterly dead, and hence “plucked up by the roots.” Spiritually these men were “twice dead” in having returned, after baptism, to the death of sin. The writer piles up metaphor on metaphor and epithet on epithet in the effort to express his indignation and abhorrence. The epithets here are in logical order: in autumn, fruitless, dead, rooted up.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Foaming out their own shame.</span>—More literally, <span class= "ital">shames</span>, their shameful acts. <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm" title2="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a> is probably in St. Jude’s mind: “The wicked are like the troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”<p><span class= "bld">Wandering stars.</span>—Nothing is gained by understanding comets, which have their orbits, and do not wander, in St. Jude’s sense, any more than planets do. The image is that of stars leaving their place in the heavens, where they are beautiful and useful, and wandering away (to the utter confusion of every one who directs his course by them) into sunless gloom, where their light is extinguished, and whence they cannot return. This simile suits the “false teachers of 2 Peter better than the “ungodly” of Jude. Would the writer of 2 Peter have neglected to avail himself of it?<p>(14) <span class= "bld">And Enoch also.</span>—On the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>and this famous quotation from it, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the Epistle. The following passage from Irenæus (IV. Xvi. 2) shows that he was acquainted with the book, and throws light on St. Jude’s use of it:—“Enoch also, pleasing God without circumcision, was God’s ambassador to the angels, although he was a man, and was raised to heaven, and is preserved even until now as a witness of the just judgment of God. For the angels by transgression fell to earth for judgment, while a man, by pleasing God, was raised to heaven for salvation.” The mission of Enoch to the fallen angels is narrated in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>12-16.<p><span class= "bld">The seventh from Adam.</span>—This is not inserted without special meaning. It was scarcely needed to distinguish the son of Jared from the son of Cain; in that case it would have been more simple to say, “the son of Jared.” It either points to the extreme antiquity of the prophecy, or else to the mystical and sabbatical number seven. Enoch (see preceding Note) was a type of perfected humanity, and hence the notion of “divine completion and rest” is perhaps suggested here. Thus, Augustine, in his reply to Faustus the Manichæan (xii. 14):—“Enoch, <span class= "ital">the seventh from Adam, </span>pleased God and was translated, as there is to be a <span class= "ital">seventh day of rest, </span>in which all will be translated who during the sixth day of the world’s history are created anew by the incarnate Word.” Several of the numbers connected with Enoch in Genesis seem to be symmetrical, and intended to convey a meaning.<p><span class= "bld">With ten thousands of his saints.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">among His holy myriads</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>encircled by them. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title2="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title2="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>.)<p>(15) <span class= "bld">To execute judgment.</span>—The Greek phrase occurs only here and <a href="/john/5-27.htm" title2="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To convince.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">to convict.</span> (Comp. <a href="/john/8-46.htm" title2="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>, and see Notes on <a href="/john/16-8.htm" title2="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>, and on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title2="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24</a>.) The words “among them” must be omitted, as wanting in authority.<p><span class= "bld">Hard speeches.</span>—Comp. <a href="/john/6-60.htm" title2="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>, the only other place where this epithet is applied to words. The meaning is somewhat similar in each case: harsh, repulsive, inhuman. It does not mean “hard to understand.” Nabal (<a href="/1_samuel/25-3.htm" title2="Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.">1Samuel 25:3</a>) has this epithet with the LXX., where the Authorised version has “churlish.” In the Ethiopic version of the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> there appears to be nothing to represent “hard speeches . . . spoken” in this passage.<p>(16-18) Description corresponding to Balaam.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Complainers.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">discontented with their lot.</span> Men who “shape their course according to their own lusts” can never be content, for (1) the means of gratifying them are not always present, and (2) the lusts are insatiable. Such was eminently the case with Balaam, in his cupidity and his chafing against the restraints which prevented him from gratitifying it. There is a possible reference to this verse in the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (<span class= "ital">Sim. </span>IX. xix. 3).<p><span class= "bld">Great swelling words.</span>—See Note on <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title2="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having men’s persons in admiration</span>.—More simply, <span class= "ital">admiring persons</span> (so the Rhemish version)—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>having regard to people of distinction, as Balaam to Balak. These ungodly men were courtiers, flatterers, and parasites.<p><span class= "bld">Because of advantage.</span>—<span class= "ital">For the sake of advantage</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to gain something by it: like “for reward” (<a href="/jude/1-11.htm" title2="Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.">Jude 1:11</a>). Exactly Balaam’s case. Note that each half of the verse falls into an irregular triplet.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">But, beloved.</span>—Better, as in <a href="/jude/1-20.htm" title2="But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,">Jude 1:20</a>, <span class= "ital">But ye, beloved. “</span>Ye” is emphatic in both cases: “ye,” in contrast to these impious men. All previous English versions insert the “ye.” While taking the form of an exhortation, the passage still remains virtually descriptive. “Be not ye deceived by their impudent boasting and interested pandering, for these are the scoffing sensualists against whom the Apostles warned you.”<p><span class= "bld">Spoken before of the apostles.</span>—The old use of “of” for “by,” like “carried about of winds” (<a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>). (Comp. <a href="/2_peter/2-19.htm" title2="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2Peter 2:19</a>.) St. Jude implies that this warning of the Apostles is well known to those whom he addresses. This appeal to the authority of Apostles would be more naturally made by one who was not an Apostle, but cannot be regarded as decisive. See <span class= "ital">Introduction, </span>I., and Note on <a href="/2_peter/3-2.htm" title2="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2Peter 3:2</a>, to which, however, this is not quite parallel, for the writer there has already declared himself to be an Apostle (<a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title2="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>). There is nothing to show that the author of our Epistle regards the Apostles as considerably removed in time from himself. “In the last time is <span class= "ital">their</span> expression, not his; and by it <span class= "ital">they</span> did not mean any age remote from themselves. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title2="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1John 2:18</a>; <a href="/context/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title2="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2Timothy 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title2="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2Timothy 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title2="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title2="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>.)<p>(18) <span class= "bld">How that they told you.</span>—Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">used to tell you:</span> but we cannot infer from this that oral teaching exclusively is meant. This, again, leaves the question of the writer’s position open. Had St. Jude written “how that they told <span class= "ital">us,”</span> it would have been decisive against his being an Apostle.<p><span class= "bld">There should be mockers.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">that there shall be scoffers.</span> The quotation is direct, and is introduced formally by a word which in Greek commonly precedes a direct quotation. This, however, scarcely amounts to proof that the quotation is from a written document. The word for “mockers” here is the same as that translated “scoffers” in <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm" title2="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2Peter 3:3</a>. The translation should be the same in both passages.<p><span class= "bld">In the last time.</span>—These words had better come first: <span class= "ital">that in the last time there shall be scoffers.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">walking according to their own lusts of impieties.</span> The force of the genitive may be merely adjectival, as the Authorised version renders it: but as it may indicate the things lusted for, it is better to keep a literal rendering of it.<p>(19) Description corresponding to Korah.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">These be they.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">These are they—</span>for the sake of making the openings of <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>; <a href="/jude/1-16.htm" title2="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>; <a href="/jude/1-19.htm" title2="These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.">Jude 1:19</a> exactly alike, as they are in the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">Who separate themselves.</span>—“Themselves” must be omitted, the evidence against it being overwhelming. “Who separate:” who are creating a schism, like Korah and his company; claiming to be the chief and most enlightened members in the community to which they still profess to belong, though they turn upside down its fundamental principles. The context rather leads us to suppose that these libertines claimed to be the only “spiritual” Christians, inasmuch as they said that to their exalted spiritual natures the things of sense were purely indifferent, and might be indulged in without loss or risk; while they taunted other Christians, who regulated their conduct carefully with regard to such things, with being <span class= "ital">psychic</span> or “sensuous.” Note the three-fold division of the verse.<p><span class= "bld">Sensual.</span>—The Greek word is <span class= "ital">psychic, </span>and has no English equivalent; “sensuous” would perhaps be best. The LXX. do not use it, but it occurs six times in the New Testament. Four times (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title2="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title2="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1Corinthians 15:46</a>) it is translated “natural” (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>); once (<a href="/james/3-15.htm" title2="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">James 3:15</a>), “sensual,” with “natural” in the margin; and here simply “sensual.” In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title2="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title2="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1Corinthians 15:46</a>, the moral meaning is in the background; in the other three passages the moral meaning is prominent and is distinctly bad. <span class= "ital">Psychic</span> is the middle term of a triplet of terms, “carnal, <span class= "ital">psychic, </span>spiritual.” “Carnal” and “spiritual<span class= "ital">”</span> speak for themselves—the one bad, the other good. <span class= "ital">Psychic, </span>which comes between, is much closer to “carnal,” and with it is opposed to “spiritual.” This is more clearly seen in the Latin equivalents—<span class= "ital">carnalis, animalis, spiritalis.</span> The carnal man is ruled by his passions, and rises little above the level of the brutes. The psychic man is ruled by human reasoning, and human affections, and does not rise above the world of sense. The spiritual man is ruled by his spirit—the noblest part of his nature—and this is ruled by the Spirit of God. He rises to and lives among those things which can only be “spiritually discerned.” Our Christian psychology is seriously affected by the absence of any English word for <span class= "ital">psychic</span>—the part of man’s nature which it represents is often lost sight of.<p><span class= "bld">Having not the Spirit.</span>—Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">because they have no spirit.</span> The Holy Spirit may be meant, although the Greek word has no article; but more probably spiritual power and insight is what is meant. These men had allowed the spiritual part of then nature, of which they talked so much, to become so buried in the mire of sensual indulgence and human self-sufficiency, that it was utterly inoperative and practically non-existent. The form of negative used in the Greek seems to imply that their “having no spirit” is the reason why they are justly called “sensuous.”<p>Each of these three descriptions (<a href="/context/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12-19</a>) is shorter than the preceding one.

Commentators, however, are not agreed what sort of feasts they were. Some think they were those suppers which the first Christians ate previous to their eating the Lord’s supper, of which St. Paul is supposed to have spoken <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title2="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>; but which, in consequence of the abuse of them by persons of a character like those here described, were soon laid aside. Others think Jude is speaking of the ancient <span class="ital">love-suppers, </span>which Tertullian hath described, (<span class="ital">Apol., </span>chap. 39,) and which do not seem to have been accompanied with the eucharist. These were continued in the church to the middle of the fourth century, when they were prohibited to be kept in the churches. Dr. Benson observes, “they were called <span class="ital">love-feasts, </span>or suppers, because the richer Christians brought in a variety of provisions to feed the poor, the fatherless, the widows, and strangers, and ate with them to show their love to them.” <span class="ital">When they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear — </span>Abandoning themselves to gluttony and excess, without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves, and so bringing a great reproach on the gospel, and the religion of Christ. <span class="ital">Clouds without water </span>— Promising fertilizing showers of instruction and edification, but yielding none, or making a show of what they have not; see on <a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2 Peter 2:17</a>; <span class="ital">carried about of winds </span>— Of temptation hither and thither, without any command of themselves, into various sorts of wickedness. <span class="ital">Trees without fruit </span>— The original expression, <span class="greekheb">δενδρα φθινοπωρινα</span>, is rendered by Macknight, <span class="ital">withered autumnal trees; </span>the latter word being derived from <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρον</span>, which, according to Scapula, signifies, <span class="ital">The decline of autumn drawing toward winter. </span>Or, according to Phavorinus, it signifies <span class="ital">a disease in trees</span> <span class="ital">which withers their fruit; </span>a sense of the word which Beza has adopted in his translation. The translation of the Vulgate, <span class="ital">arbores autumnales infructuoscæ, </span>gives the same sense with that of Macknight, and suggests, he thinks, a beautiful idea. For, “in the eastern countries, the finest fruits being produced in autumn, by calling the corrupt teachers <span class="ital">autumnal trees, </span>Jude intimated the just expectation which was entertained of their being fruitful in good doctrine: but by adding <span class="greekheb">ακαρπα</span>, <span class="ital">without fruit, </span>he marked their uselessness, and the disappointment of their disciples.” <span class="ital">Twice dead — </span>First in the stock, and afterward in the graft; first by nature, and afterward by apostacy.

These teachers are of a disturbed mind and a seditious spirit; forgetting that the powers that be, are ordained of God, Ro 13:1. As to the contest about the body of Moses, it appears that Satan wished to make the place of his burial known to the Israelites, in order to tempt them to worship him, but he was prevented, and vented his rage in desperate blasphemy. This should remind all who dispute never to bring railing charges. Also learn hence, that we ought to defend those whom God owns. It is hard, if not impossible, to find any enemies to the Christian religion, who did not, and do not, live in open or secret contradiction to the principles of natural religion. Such are here compared to brute beasts, though they often boast of themselves as the wisest of mankind. They corrupt themselves in the things most open and plain. The fault lies, not in their understandings, but in their depraved wills, and their disordered appetites and affections. It is a great reproach, though unjust to religion, when those who profess it are opposed to it in heart and life. The Lord will remedy this in his time and way; not in men's blind way of plucking up the wheat with the tares. It is sad when men begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Twice dead; they had been once dead in their natural, fallen state; but now they are dead again by the evident proofs of their hypocrisy. Dead trees, why cumber they the ground! Away with them to the fire. Raging waves are a terror to sailing passengers; but when they get into port, the noise and terror are ended. False teachers are to expect the worst punishments in this world and in that to come. They glare like meteors, or falling stars, and then sink into the blackness of darkness for ever. We have no mention of the prophecy of Enoch in any other part or place of Scripture; yet one plain text of Scripture, proves any point we are to believe. We find from this, that Christ's coming to judge was prophesied of, as early as the times before the flood. The Lord cometh: what a glorious time will that be! Notice how often the word ungodly is repeated. Many now do not at all refer to the terms godly, or ungodly, unless it be to mock at even the words; but it is not so in the language taught us by the Holy Ghost. Hard speeches of one another, especially if ill-grounded, will certainly come into account at the day of judgment. These evil men and seducers are angry at every thing that happens, and never pleased with their own state and condition. Their will and their fancy, are their only rule and law. Those who please their sinful appetites, are most prone to yield to ungovernable passions. The men of God, from the beginning of the world, have declared the doom denounced on them. Such let us avoid. We are to follow men only as they follow Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are spots - See the notes at <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>. The word used by Peter, however, is not exactly the same as that used here. Peter uses the word, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  spiloi; Jude, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  spilades. The word used by Jude means, properly, "a rock" by or in the sea; a cliff, etc. It may either be a rock by the sea, against which vessels may be wrecked, or a hidden rock "in" the sea, on which they may be stranded at an unexpected moment. See Hesyehius and Pollux, as quoted by Wetstein, "in loc." The idea here seems to be, not that they were "spots and blemishes" in their sacred feasts, but that they were like hidden rocks to the mariner. As those rocks were the cause of shipwreck, so these false teachers caused others to make shipwreck of their faith. They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean.<p>In your feasts of charity - Your feasts of love. The reference is probably to the Lord's Supper, called a feast or festival of love, because:<p>(1) it revealed the love of Christ to the world;<p>(2) it was the means of strengthening the mutual love of the disciples: a festival which love originated, and where love reigned.<p>It has been supposed by many, that the reference here is to festivals which were subsequently called "Agapae," and which are now known as "love-feasts" - meaning a festival immediately "preceding" the celebration of the Lord's Supper. But there are strong objections to the supposition that there is reference here to such a festival.<p>(1) there is no evidence, unless it be found in this passage, that such celebrations had the sanction of the apostles. They are nowhere else mentioned in the New Testament, or alluded to, unless it is in 1Co. 11:17-34, an instance which is mentioned only to reprove it, and to show that such appendages to the Lord's Supper were wholly unauthorized by the original institution, and were liable to gross abuse.<p>(2) the supposition that they existed, and that they are referred to here, is not necessary in order to a proper explanation of this passage. All that it fairly means will be met by the supposition that the reference is to the Lord's Supper. that was in every sense a festival of love or charity. The words will appropriately apply to that, and there is no necessity of supposing anything else in order to meet their full signification.<p>(3) there can be no doubt that such a custom early existed in the Christian church, and extensively prevailed; but it can readily be accounted for without supposing that it had the sanction of the apostles, or that it existed in their time.<p>(a) Festivals prevailed among the Jews, and it would not be unnatural to introduce them into the Christian church.<p>(b) The custom prevailed among the heathen of having a "feast upon a sacrifice," or in connection with a sacrifice; and as the Lord's Supper commemorated the great sacrifice for sin, it was not unnatural, in imitation of the heathen, to append a feast or festival to that ordinance, either before or after its celebration.<p>(c) This very passage in Jude, with perhaps some others in the New Testament (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>; <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2</a>), might be so construed as to seem to lend countenance to the custom. For these reasons it seems clear to me that the passage before us does not refer to "love-feasts;" and, therefore, that they are not authorized in the New Testament. See, however, Coleman's Antiquities of the Christian church, chapter xvi., Section 13.<p>When they feast with you - Showing that they were professors of religion.

The oldest manuscript prefixes the article emphatically, "THE rocks." The reference to "clouds &#8230; winds &#8230; waves of the sea," accords with this image of rocks. Vulgate seems to have been misled by the similar sounding word to translate, as English Version, "spots"; compare however, Jude 23, which favors English Version, if the Greek will bear it. Two oldest manuscripts, by the transcriber's effort to make Jude say the same as Peter, read here "deceivings" for "love-feasts," but the weightiest manuscript and authorities support English Version reading. The love-feast accompanied the Lord's Supper (1Co 11:17-34, end). Korah the Levite, not satisfied with his ministry, aspired to the sacrificing priesthood also: so ministers in the Lord's Supper have sought to make it a sacrifice, and themselves the sacrificing priests, usurping the function of our only Christian sacerdotal Priest, Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah's doom!<p>feeding themselves&#8212;Greek, "pasturing (tending) themselves." What they look to is the pampering of themselves, not the feeding of the flock.<p>without fear&#8212;Join these words not as English Version, but with "feast." Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated with fear.

So these apostates, once dead in unbelief, and then by profession and baptism raised from the death of sin to the life of righteousness, but now having become dead again by apostasy, and so hopelessly dead. There is a climax.

Or "love". The Jews speak , "of a feast of faith" (b). These here seem to be the Agapae, or love feasts, of the primitive Christians; the design of which was to maintain and promote brotherly love, from whence they took their name; and to refresh the poor saints, that they might have a full and comfortable meal now and then: their manner of keeping them was this; they began and ended them with prayer and singing; and they observed them with great temperance and frugality; and they were attended with much joy and gladness, and simplicity of heart: but were quickly abused, by judaizing Christians, as observing them in imitation of the passover; and by intemperance in eating and drinking; and by excluding the poor, for whose benefit they were chiefly designed; and by setting up separate meetings for them, and by admitting unfit persons unto them; such as here are said to be spots in them, blemishes, which brought great reproach and scandal upon them, being persons of infamous characters and conversations. The allusion is either to spots in garments, or in faces, or in sacrifices; or to a sort of earth that defiles; or else to rocks and hollow stones on shores, lakes, and rivers, which collect filth and slime; all which serve to expose and point out the persons designed. The Alexandrian copy and some others read, "these are in their own deceivings, spots",  instead of  as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>, <p>when they feast with you; which shows that they were among them, continued members with them, and partook with them in their solemn feasts, and were admitted to communion; and carries in it a kind of reproof to the saints, that they suffered such persons among them, and allowed them such privilege, intimacy, and familiarity with them: <p>feeding themselves without fear; these were like the shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves, and not the flock, and were very impious and impudent, open and bare faced in their iniquities, neither fearing God nor regarding man, <p>Clouds they are, without water; they are compared to clouds for their number, being many false prophets and antichrists that were come out into the world; and for their sudden rise, having at once, and at an unawares, crept into the churches; and for the general darkness they spread over the churches, making it, by their doctrines and practices, to be a dark and cloudy day, a day of darkness, and gloominess, a day of clouds, and of thick darkness, a day of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy; and for the storms, factions, rents, and divisions they made; as also for their situation and height, soaring aloft, and being vainly puffed up in their fleshly mind; as well as for their sudden destruction, disappearing at once. And to clouds "without water", because destitute of the true grace of God, and of true evangelical doctrine; which, like rain, is from above, from heaven; and which, like that, refreshes, softens, and fructifies. Now these false teachers looked like clouds, that promised rain, boasted of Gospel light and knowledge, but were destitute of it, wherefore their ministry was uncomfortable and unprofitable, <p>Carried about of winds; either of false doctrines, or of their own lusts and passions, or of Satan's temptations: <p>trees whose fruit withereth: or "trees in autumn"; either like to them, which put forth at that season of the year, and so come to nothing; or like to trees which are bare of leaves as well as fruit, it being the time when the leaves fall from the trees; and so may be expressive of these persons casting off the leaves of an outward profession, of their going out from the churches, separating from them, and forsaking the assembling together with them, when what fruit of holiness, and good works, they seemed to have, came to nothing; and so were <p>without fruit, either of Gospel doctrine, or of Gospel holiness and righteousness; nor did they make any true converts, but what they made were like the Pharisees, as bad, or worse than themselves; and from their unfruitfulness in all respects, it appeared that they were not in Christ the true vine, and were not sent forth by him, nor with his Gospel, and that they were destitute of the Spirit of God, <p>Twice dead; that is, entirely, thoroughly, and really dead in trespasses and sins, notwithstanding their pretensions to religion and godliness; or the sense may be, that they were not only liable to a corporeal death, common to them with all mankind, but also to an eternal one, or to the death both of soul and body in hell. Homer calls (d) those  "twice dead", that go to hell alive: or rather the sense is this, that they were dead in sin by nature, as all men are, and again having made a profession of religion, were now become dead to that profession; and so were twice dead, once as they were born, and a second time as they had apostatized: <p>plucked up by the roots; either by separating themselves from the churches, where they had been externally planted; or by the act of the church in cutting them off, and casting them out; or by the judgment of God upon them, <p>(b) Zohar in Exod. fol. 36. 3, 4.

Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>, is decisive in favour of the first explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The connection of <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως</span> is doubtful; de Wette-Brückner, Arnaud, Schott, Fronmüller unite it with <span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι</span>; Erasmus, Beza, Wiesinger, Hofmann, with <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς ποιμαίνοντες</span>. In this commentary the first connection was preferred, “because the idea <span class="greekheb">συνευωχ</span>. would otherwise be too bare.” This, however, is not the case, because if the verse is construed, as it is by Hofmann, it has its statement in what goes before; but if <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> is taken as a substantive, as it is by Stier and Fronmüller, then <span class="greekheb">συνευωχ</span>. is more precisely determined by the following <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιμαίνοντες</span>, whilst it is said that they so participate in the <span class="ital">agapé</span> that their feasting was a <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως ποιμαίνειν ἑαυτούς</span>. Erasmus takes the latter words in a too general sense: suo ductu et arbitrio viventes; Grotius, Bengel, and others give a false reference to them after <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm" title2="Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?">Ezekiel 34:2</a>, understanding “that these feed themselves and not the church” (comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title2="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>), and accordingly Schneckenburger thinks specially on the instructions which they engage to give; but this reference is entirely foreign to the context. According to de Wette, it is a contrast to “whilst they suffer the poor to want” (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title2="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>); yet there is also here no indication of this reference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νεφέλαι ἄνυδροι</span>] is to be understood no more of the <span class="ital">agapé</span> (de Wette, Schott), but generally. <span class="greekheb">νεφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄνυδρ</span>. are light clouds without water, which therefore, as the addition <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ ἀνέμων παραφερόμεναι</span> makes prominent, are driven past by the wind without giving out rain; comp. <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm" title2="Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.">Proverbs 25:14</a>. This figure describes the internal emptiness of these men, who for this reason can effect nothing that is good; but it seems also to intimate their deceptive ostentation[37]; the addition serves for the colouring of the figure, not for adducing a special characteristic of false teachers; Nicolas de Lyra incorrectly: quae a ventis circumferuntur i. e. superbiae motibus et vanitatibus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the parallel passage, <a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2 Peter 2:17</a>, two images are united: <span class="greekheb">πηγαὶ ἄνυδροι καὶ ὁμίχλαι ὑπὸ λαίλαπος ἐλαυνόμεναι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to the reading <span class="greekheb">περιφερόμεναι</span>, the translation would be: “driven hither and thither;” <span class="greekheb">παραφερόμεναι</span> denotes, on the other hand, <span class="ital">driven past</span>. A second figure is added to this first, by which the unfruitfulness (in good works) and the complete deadness of these men are described; in the adjectives the gradation is obvious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δένδρα φθινοπωρινά</span>] are not a particular kind of trees, such as only bare fruit in autumn, but trees <span class="ital">as they are in autumn</span>, namely, destitute of fruit (de Wette-Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott, etc.). It is arbitrary to desert the proper meaning of the word, and to explain <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρινά</span> according to the etymology of <span class="greekheb">φθίνειν</span> by arbores quarum fructus perit illico = frugiperdae (Grotius; so also Erasmus, Beza, Carpzov, Stier. “which have cast off their fruit in an unripe state”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄκαρπα</span>] not: “whose fruit has been taken off” (de Wette), but “which are without fruit” (Brückner). Whether they have had fruit at an earlier period, and are now destitute of it, is not said. “The impassioned discourse proceeds from marks of unfruitfulness to that of absolute nothingness” (de Wette). <span class="greekheb">δὶς ἀποθανόντα</span>] Beza, Rosenmüller, and others arbitrarily explain <span class="greekheb">δίς</span> by plane, prorsus. Most expositors retain the usual meaning; yet they explain the idea <span class="ital">twice</span> in different ways; either that those trees are not only destitute of fruit, but also of leaves (so Oecumenius, Hornejus, and others); or that they bear no fruit, and are accordingly rooted out; or still better, <span class="greekheb">δίς</span> is to be referred to the fact that they are not only <span class="ital">fruitless</span>, but <span class="ital">actually dead and dried up</span>.[38] That Jude has this in his view, the following <span class="greekheb">ἐκριζωθέντα</span> shows. Several expositors have incorrectly deserted the figure here, and explained this word either of twofold spiritual death (Beza, Estius, Bengel, Schneckenburger, Jachmann, Wiesinger, Schott), or of death here and hereafter (so Grotius: neque hic bonum habebunt exitum, neque in seculo altero), or of one’s own want of spiritual life and the destruction of life in others. All these explanations are without justification. <span class="greekheb">ἐκριζωθέντα</span> is in close connection with <span class="greekheb">δὶς ἀποθανόντα</span>; thus, trees which, because they are dead, are dug up and rooted out;[39] thus incapable of recovery and of producing new fruit (Erasmus: quibus jam nulla spes est revirescendi). This figure, taken from trees, denotes that those described are not only at present destitute of good works, but are incapable of producing them in the future, and are “on this account rooted out of the soil of grace” (Hofmann). It is incorrect when Hofmann[40] in the application refers <span class="greekheb">δὶς ἀποθανόντα</span> to the fact that those men were not only in their early heathenism, but also in their Christianity, without spiritual life. There is no indication in the context of the distinction between heathenism and Christianity. Arnaud observes not incorrectly, but too generally: tous ces mots sont des métaphores énergiques pour montrer le néant de ces impies, la légèreté de leur conduite, la stérilité de leur foi et l’absence de leurs bonnes oeuvres.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] The explanation of Arnaud: les rochers continuellement battus par les flots de la mer et souillés par son écume (after Steph.: <span class="greekheb">σπιλάς</span>), is unsuitable; since, when the Libertines are called cliffs, this happens not because they are bespattered and defiled by others, but because others are wrecked on them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] An explanation of this word is found in Xenophon, <span class="ital">Memorabilia</span>, lib. iii.: <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγε</span> (namely, Socrates) <span class="greekheb">δὲ καὶ ὡς τὸ εὐωχεῖσθαι ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων γλώττῃ ἐσθίειν κάλοιτο</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ δὲ εὐ προσκεῖθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔφη ἐπὶ τῷ ταῦτα ἐσθίειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἅτινα μήτε τὴν ψυχὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτε τὸ σῶμα λυποίη</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτε δυσεύρετα εἴη</span>; <span class="greekheb">ὥστε καὶ τὸ εὐωχεῖσθαι τοῖς κοσμίως διαιτμωένοις ἀνετίθει</span>.

On the early history of the Agape, see my Appendix C to Clem. Al. <span class="ital">Strom.</span> vii. The parallel passage in 2 Peter (on which see n.) has two remarkable divergencies from the text here, reading <span class="greekheb">ἀπάταις</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπαις</span> and <span class="greekheb">σπῖλοι</span> for <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span>. There has been much discussion as to the meaning of the latter word. It is agreed that it is generally used of a rock in or by the sea, and many of the lexicographers understand it of a hidden rock, <span class="greekheb">ὕφαλος πέτρα</span>, see Thomas Mag., <span class="greekheb">σπιλάς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἀττικῶς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὕφαλος πέτρα</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἕλληνες</span>, Etymol. [795]., <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> … <span class="greekheb">αἱ ὑπὸ θάλασσαν κεκρυμμέναι πέτραι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅθεν καὶ ὕφαλος ἄνθρωπος λέγεται ὁ κεκρυμμένος καὶ πανοῦργος</span>, <span class="ital">ib.</span> <span class="greekheb">κατασπιλάζοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατακρύπτοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν ὑφάλων πετρῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἵτινες ὑπὸ ὕδατος καλυπτόμεναι τοῖς ἀπρούπτως προσπελάζουσι κίνδυνον ἐπιφέρουσι</span> (both cited by Wetst.). The same explanation is given by the scholiast on Hom. <span class="ital">Od.</span> ver 401–405, <span class="greekheb">καὶ δὴ δοῦπον ἄκουσε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσι θαλάσσης</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἀκταὶ προβλῆτες ἔσαν σπιλάδες τε πάγοι τε</span>. See Plut. <span class="ital">Mor.</span> 101 B, <span class="greekheb">εὐδία σπιλάδος</span>, which Wytt. translates “tranquillitas maris caecam rupem tegentis,” <span class="ital">ib.</span> 476 A, Oecumenius on this passage, <span class="greekheb">αἱ σπιλάδες τοῖς πλέουσιν ὀλέθριοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐπιγενόμεναι</span> (? -<span class="greekheb">νοις</span>), and <span class="greekheb">ἐξαίφνης</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ σπιλάδες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπάγοντες αὐτοῖς τὸν ὄλεθρον τῶν ψυχῶν</span>. Wetst. also quotes Heliod. ver 31, <span class="greekheb">θαλάσσῃ προσείκασας ἂν τοὺς ἄνδρας αἰφνιδίῳ σπιλάδι κατασεισθέντας</span>. The compound <span class="greekheb">κατασπιλάζω</span> joined with the parallel case of <span class="greekheb">ὕφαλος</span> justifies, I think, this sense of <span class="greekheb">σπιλάς</span>, which is rejected by most of the later commentators.[796] <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also the use of <span class="greekheb">ναυαγέω</span> in <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm" title2="Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:">1 Timothy 1:19</a>. <span class="ital">Scopulus</span> is used in a similar metaphoric sense, see Cic. <span class="ital">in Pis.</span> 41 where Piso and Gabinius are called “geminae voragines scopulique reipublicae”. Others take <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> in the very rare sense of “spots,” or “stains,” like <span class="greekheb">σπίλοι</span> in 2 Peter. The only example of this sense seems to be in Orph. <span class="ital">Lith.</span> 614, but Hesych. gives the interpretation <span class="greekheb">σπιλάς</span>, <span class="greekheb">μεμιασμένοι</span>. I agree with Bp. Wordsworth and Dr. Chase in thinking that the metaphor of the sunken rocks is more in harmony with the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[795] Codex Ruber (sæc. ix.), at the British Museum; it derives its name from the colour of the ink.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[796] Dr. Bigg denies this meaning on the strength mainly of two quotations, Hom. <span class="ital">Od</span>. iii. 298, <span class="greekheb">ἀτὰρ νῆάς γε ποτὶ σπιλάδεσσιν ἔαξαν κύματα</span>, where, he says, the <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> are identical with <span class="greekheb">λισσὴ αἰπεῖά τε εἰς ἅλα πέτρη</span> of 293; and Anthol. xi. 390, <span class="greekheb">φασὶ δὲ καὶ νήεσσιν ἁλιπλανέεσσι χερείους τὰς ὑφάλους πέτρας τῶν φανερῶν σπιλάδων</span>. In both of these I think the word refers to the breakers at the bottom of the cliffs: in the latter it is said that hidden rocks are more dangerous than visible reefs. Compare Diod. iii. 43, <span class="greekheb">ὄρος δὲ ταύτῃ παράκειται κατὰ μὲν τὴν κορυφὴν πέτρας ἀποτομάδας ἔχον καὶ τοῖς ὕψεσι καταπληκτικάς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ δὲ τὰς ῥίζας σπιλάδας ὀξείας καὶ πυκνὰς ἐνθαλάττους</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How are we to account for the gender in <span class="greekheb">οἱ</span> … <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες συνευωχούμενοι</span>? Are we to suppose the gender of <span class="greekheb">σπιλάς</span> was changed or forgotten in late Greek (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Winer, pp. 25, 38, 73, 76)? If so, the forgetfulness seems to have been confined to this author. Or is this a <span class="ital">coustructio ad sensum</span>, the feminine being changed to masculine because it is metaphorically used of men (Winer, pp. 171, 648, 660, 672), <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/11-4.htm" title2="These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.">Revelation 11:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὗτοί εἰσιν αἱ δύο λυχνίαι αἱ ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου ἑστῶτες</span> and B’s reading <span class="greekheb">παραφερόμενοι</span> below? Or may we take <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> as expressing a complementary notion in apposition to <span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι</span>? The last seems the best explanation though I cannot recall any exact parallel. An easier remedy would be to omit the article (with [797] and many versions), as suggested by Dr. Chase in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, ii. p. 799<span class="ital">b</span>, translating: “these are sunken rocks in your love-feasts while they feast with you”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[797] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι</span>.

If we take <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> as complementary to <span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι</span>, it is better to take <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως</span> with <span class="greekheb">ποιμ</span>.: if we omit the article and take <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> to be the predicate, <span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι</span> will be an epexegetic participle, which will require strengthening by <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως</span>. Generally <span class="greekheb">ἀφ</span>. is used in a good sense, but we find it used, as here, of the want of a right fear in <a href="/proverbs/19-23.htm" title2="The fear of the LORD tends to life: and he that has it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.">Proverbs 19:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">φόβος Κυρίου εἰς ζωὴν ἀνδρί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ ἄφοβος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm" title2="Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.">Proverbs 15:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">κρεῖσσον μικρὰ μερὶς μετὰ φόβου Κυρίου ἢ θησαυροὶ μεγάλοι μετὰ ἀφοβίας</span>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-5.htm" title2="Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto sin:">Sir 5:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">περὶ ἐξιλασμοῦ μὴ ἄφοβος γίνου</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίαν ἐφʼ ἁμαρτίαις</span>.

Spitta points out the resemblance to a passage in Enoch (chapters ii.–v.), which follows immediately on the words quoted below, <a href="/context/jude/1-14.htm" title2="And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What will you?...">Jude 1:14-15</a>. The regular order of nature is there contrasted with the disorder and lawlessness of sinners. “I observed everything that took place in the heaven, how the luminaries … do not deviate from their orbits, how they all rise and set in order, each in its season, and transgress not against their appointed order.… I observed and saw how in winter all the trees seem as though they were withered and shed all their leaves.… And again I observed the days of summer … how the trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit.… And behold how the seas and the rivers accomplish their task.

Perhaps the writer may have thought that there was an undue multiplication of causes; if the clouds were waterless, it was needless to add that they were driven past by the wind. We find the same comparison in <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm" title2="Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.">Proverbs 25:14</a> : “As clouds and wind without rain, so is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely”.

Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δένδρα φθινοπωρινὰ ἄκαρπα</span>. <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρινός</span> is an adjective derived from <span class="greekheb">τὸ φθινόπωρον</span>, which is itself, I think, best explained as a compound of <span class="greekheb">φθίνουσα ὀπώρα</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">φθίνοντος μηνός</span>), meaning the concluding portion of the <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span>. This latter word is, according to Curtius, compounded of <span class="greekheb">ὀπ</span>-, connected with <span class="greekheb">ὀπίσω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὄπισθεν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὥρα</span> = “the later prime”. We find <span class="greekheb">ὥρα</span> used by itself both for the spring with its flowers and, more rarely, for the summer with its fruits, as in Thuc. ii. 52, <span class="greekheb">ὥρα ἔτους</span>. Perhaps from this double use of the word may have come the ambiguity in the application of <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span>, of which Ideler says that “it originally indicated, not a season separate from and following after the summer, but the hottest part of the summer itself, so that Sirius, whose heliacal rising took place (in the age of Homer) about the middle of July, is described as <span class="greekheb">ἀστὴρ ὀπωρινός</span> <span class="ital">Il.</span> <a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>). In early times it would seem that the Greeks, like the Germans (Tac. <span class="ital">Germ.</span> 26), recognised only three seasons—winter, spring, summer, and that the last was indifferently named <span class="greekheb">θέρος</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span>: compare Arist. <span class="ital">Aves</span> 709, <span class="greekheb">πρῶτα μὲν ὥρας φαίνομεν ἡμεῖς ἦρος</span>, <span class="greekheb">χειμῶνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρας</span>, with Aesch. <span class="ital">Prom.</span> 453, <span class="greekheb">ἦν δʼ οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς οὔτε χείματος τέκμαρ οὔτʼ ἀνθεμώδους ἦρος οὔτε χείματος τέκμαρ οὔτʼ ἀνθεμώδους ἦρος οὔτε καρπίμου θέρους βέβαιον</span>. But though <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span> was thus used strictly for the dog-days, when the fruit ripened, it was also vaguely used for the unnamed period which ensued up to the commencement of winter. Thus Hesiod (<span class="ital">Op.</span> 674) <span class="greekheb">μηδὲ μένειν οἷνόν τε νέον καὶ ὀπωρινὸν ὄμεβρον καὶ χειμῶνʼ ἐπιόντα</span>: and <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span> appears as a definite season by the side of the others in a line ot Euripides, qnoted by Plutarch (<span class="ital">Mor.</span> 1028 F), from which it appears that he assigned four months each to summer and winter, and two to spring and <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span>:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">φίλης τʼ ὀπώρας διπτύχους ἦρος τʼ ἴσους</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(where the epithet <span class="greekheb">φίλης</span> deserves notice). It is said that the author of the treatise <span class="ital">De Diaeta</span> (c. 420 B.C.), which goes under the name of Hippocrates, was the first to introduce a definite term (<span class="greekheb">φθινόπωρον</span> or <span class="greekheb">μετόπωρον</span>) for the new season, the word <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span> being reserved for the late summer, according to the definition of Eustath. on <span class="ital">Il.</span> <a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα ὥρα μεταξὺ κειμένη θέρους καὶ τοῦ μετʼ αὑτὴν μετοπώρου</span>. And so we find it used by Aristotle (<span class="ital">Meteor</span>. ii. 5), <span class="greekheb">αἱ χάλαζαι γίνονται ἔαρος μὲν καὶ μετοπώρου μάλιστα</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἶτα τῆς ὀπώρας χειμῶνος δὲ ὀλιγάκις</span>, and by Theophrastus (<span class="greekheb">περὶ Σημείων</span>, 44), <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τὸ ἔαρ καὶ τὸ θέρος ψυχρὰ γίνηται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ὀπώρα γίνεται καὶ τὸ μετόπωρον πνιγηρόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a good deal of inconsistency about the exact limits of the seasons, as is natural enough when we remember that they were first distinguished for purposes of agriculture and navigation, as we see in Hesiod’s <span class="ital">Works and Days</span>. Each season brings its own proper work, and the farmer or merchant is reminded of the return of the season by various signs, the rising and setting of stars, especially of the Pleiades and Arcturus, the sun’s passage through the signs of the zodiac, the reappearance of the birds, etc. A more strictly accurate division was made by the astronomers, who distinguished between the various kinds of rising and setting of the stars, and divided the year into four equal parts by the solstices and equinoxes. In the year 46 B.C. Julius Caesar introduced his revised calendar, which assigned definite dates to the different seasons. Thus spring begins <span class="ital">a.d. vii. id. Feb.</span> (Feb. 7), summer <span class="ital">a.d. vii. id. Mai.</span> (May 9), autumn <span class="ital">a.d. iii. id. Sext.</span> (Aug. 11), winter <span class="ital">a.d. iv. id. Nov.</span> (Nov. 10).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To turn now to the commentators, I may take Trench as representing their view in his <span class="ital">Authorised Version</span>, p. 186, ed. 2, where he says, “The <span class="greekheb">φθινόπωρον</span> is the late autumn … which succeeds the <span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span> (or the autumn contemplated as the time of the ripened fruits of the earth) and which has its name <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τὸ φθίνεσθαι τὴν ὀπώραν</span>, from the waning away of the autumn and the autumn fruits.… The deceivers of whom St. Jude speaks are likened to trees as they show in late autumn, when foliage and fruit alike are gone.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I have stated above what I hold to be the origin of the word <span class="greekheb">φθινόπωρον</span>. Trench’s explanation is ambiguous and unsuited to the facts of the case, as will be seen from the criticisms in Lightfoot’s <span class="ital">Fresh Revision</span>, p. 135: “In the phrase ‘autumn-trees without fruit’ there appears to be a reference to the parable of the fig-tree.… At all events the mention of the season when fruit might be expected is significant.” He adds in a note, “Strange to say, the earliest versions all rendered <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρινά</span> correctly.[799] Tyndale’s instinct led him to give what I cannot but think the right turn to the expression, ‘Trees with out frute at gadringe (gathering) time,’ <span class="ital">i.e.</span> at the season when fruit was looked for. I cannot agree with Archbishop Trench, who maintains that ‘Tyndale was feeling after, though he has not grasped, the right translation,’ and himself explains <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρινὰ ἄκαρπα</span> as ‘mutually completing one another, <span class="ital">without leaves, without fruit</span>’. Tyndale was followed by Coverdale and the Great Bible. Similarly Wycliffe has ‘hervest trees without fruyt,’ and the Rheims version ‘trees of autumne unfruiteful’. The earliest offender is the Geneva Testament, which gives ‘corrupt trees and without frute’.… The Bishops’ Bible strangely combines both renderings, ‘trees withered (<span class="greekheb">φθίνειν</span>) at fruite gathering (<span class="greekheb">ὀπώρα</span>) and without fruite,’ which is explained in the margin, ‘Trees withered in autumne when the fruite harvest is, and so the Greke woord importeth’.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[799] This agreement is probably owing to their dependence on the Vulgate “<span class="ital">arbores auctumnales infructuosae</span>”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The correctness of the interpretation, given by Lightfoot alone among modern commentators, is confirmed by a consideration of the context. The writer has just been comparing the innovators, who have crept into other Churches, to waterless clouds driven past by the wind. Just as these disappoint the hope of the husbandman, so do fruitless trees in the proper season of fruit. If <span class="greekheb">φθινοπωρινά</span> were equivalent to <span class="greekheb">χειμερινά</span>, denoting the season when the trees are necessarily bare both of leaves and fruit, how could a tree be blamed for being <span class="greekheb">ἄκαρπον</span>? It is because it might have been, and ought to have been a fruit-bearing tree, that it is rooted up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δὶς ἀποθανόντα ἐκριζωθεντα</span>. Schneckenburger explains, “He who is not born again is dead in his sins (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title2=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>), he who has apostatised is twice dead,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title2="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>, <a href="/context/hebrews/6-4.htm" title2="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,...">Hebrews 6:4-8</a>, <a href="/context/2_peter/2-20.htm" title2="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning....">2 Peter 2:20-22</a>. So the trees may be called doubly dead, when they are not only sapless, but are torn up by the root, which would have caused the death even of a living tree.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jude/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">These are spots in your feasts of charity</span>] Here also, as in <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>, the MSS. vary between “deceits” (<span class="greekheb">ἀπάταις</span>) and “feasts of charity, or <span class="ital">love</span>” (<span class="greekheb">ἀγάπαις</span>), but the evidence preponderates for the latter reading. Some MSS., including the Sinaitic, insert the words “these are murmurers …,” which now stand in <a href="/jude/1-16.htm" title2="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Jude 1:16</a>, at the beginning of this verse. The word rendered “spots” (<span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span>) is not the same as that in <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a> (<span class="greekheb">σπῖλοι</span>), and in other Greek writers has the sense of “reefs” or “rocks below the sea.” It is possible that St Jude may have looked on the two words as identical in meaning, but it is obvious, on the other hand, that the word “rocks,” though it suggests a different image, gives a perfectly adequate sense to the whole passage. The false impure teachers who presented themselves undetected in the Christian love-feasts were as sunken rocks, and, if men were not on their guard, they might easily, by contact with them, “make shipwreck” of their faith (<a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm" title2="Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:">1 Timothy 1:19</a>). On these love-feasts and their relation to the life of the Apostolic Church see notes on <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear</span>] Better, <span class="bld">feasting with you without fear, pasturing themselves</span>. The adverb is more naturally joined in the Greek with the participle that precedes it, and the English “feeding,” suggesting, as it does, in this context simply the act of eating, fails to give the force of the Greek word for “feed,” which, as being that used in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title2="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title2="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>, expresses the idea of the pastoral office. What St Jude means is that these teachers of impurity, instead of submitting themselves to the true “pastors” of the Church, came in, like the false shepherds of <a href="/context/ezekiel/34-1.htm" title2="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 34:1-2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-8.htm" title2="As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;">Ezekiel 34:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-10.htm" title2="Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.">Ezekiel 34:10</a>, to “feed themselves,” i.e. to indulge their own lusts in defiance of authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">clouds they are without water</span>] The “clouds” take the place of the “wells” of <a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2 Peter 2:17</a>. The difference of imagery makes it probable that there may have been a difference of a like kind in the previous verse, and so far confirms the interpretation as to the “rocks” in the first clause of the verse. A like comparison is found in <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm" title2="Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.">Proverbs 25:14</a> (“Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain”). Men look in the hot climate of the East to the cloud as giving promise of the rain from heaven. It is a bitter disappointment when it passes away leaving the earth hard and unrefreshed as before. So men would look in vain to these false teachers, shifting alike in their movements and their teaching, borne to and fro by “every wind of doctrine” (comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title2="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>), for any spiritual refreshment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">autumn-withering trees</span>. This may mean either simply “autumnal trees,” as “in the sere and yellow leaf” that is the forerunner of decay, or “trees that wither just at the very season when men look for fruit,” and which are therefore fit symbols of the false teachers who are known “by their fruits.” The use of a cognate word in Pindar (<span class="ital">Pyth</span>. v. 161) suggests, however, that the part of the compound word that corresponds to “autumn” may, like our “harvest,” be taken as a collective expression for the fruits of that season, and so the term, as used by St Jude, would mean “trees that wither and blight their fruit instead of bringing it to maturity.” The addition of “without fruit” is accordingly not a mere rhetorical iteration, but states the fact that the withering process was complete. The parable implied in the description was familiar to the disciples from the teaching both of John the Baptist and our Lord (<a href="/matthew/3-10.htm" title2="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/7-16.htm" title2="You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?...">Matthew 7:16-20</a>; <a href="/context/luke/13-6.htm" title2="He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none....">Luke 13:6-9</a>, and the Miracle of the Barren Fig-tree, <a href="/matthew/21-19.htm" title2="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.">Matthew 21:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">twice dead</span>] Better, <span class="bld">that have died twice</span>, stress being laid on the repetition of the act of dying. It is not easy to fix the precise meaning of the phrase, either as it affects the outward imagery or the interpretation of the parable which it involves. Probably the tree is thought to die once when it ceases to bear fruit, and a second time when the sap ceases to circulate and there is no possibility of revival. So with the false teachers, there was first the blighting of the early promise of their knowledge of the truth, and then the entire loss of all spiritual life. The end of such trees was that they were “rooted up” and cast into the fire (<a href="/matthew/3-10.htm" title2="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a>). In the interpretation of the parable, this may refer to the sentence of excommunication by which such offenders were excluded from fellowship with the Christian society, or to the judgment of God as confirming, or, it may be, anticipating that sentence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/jude/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title2="And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.">Jude 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ταῖς ἀγάπαις ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">in your agapæ</span> [<span class="ital">love-feasts</span>]) in your banquets by which brotherly <span class="ital">love</span> is nourished.—<span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span>) As there is a Paronomasia between Peter and Jude on the words <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπαις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀπάταις</span>, so there is an instance of Homonymia[5] between the same writers in the words <span class="greekheb">σπῖλοι</span>, <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.

(Now the name of the city before was Luz.)">Jude 1:23</a> : whence Hesychius has <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span>, <span class="greekheb">μεμιασμένοι</span>, <span class="ital">polluted</span>, at the same time showing a Metonymia[6] in this place. But he also says, <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἱ περιεχόμεναι τῇ θαλάσσῃ πέτραι</span>, <span class="ital">the rocks which are surrounded by the sea</span>. Moreover <span class="greekheb">στιλὰς</span> also denotes <span class="ital">a storm</span>; and this very notion, of which we have remarked an example on Chrysostom, respecting the priesthood, p. 375, is approved by Œcumenius. Let the reader make his choice. This metaphor is followed by four others; from the air, the earth, the sea, the heaven.—<span class="greekheb">συνευωχούμενοι ἀφόβως</span>, <span class="ital">feasting themselves without fear</span>) Sacred feasts are to be celebrated <span class="ital">with fear</span>; [which is opposed to luxury.—V. g.] Feasting is not faulty in itself: therefore <span class="ital">without fear</span> ought to be connected with this verb.—<span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">themselves</span>) not the flock.—<span class="greekheb">δένδρα φθινοπωρινὰ</span>) <span class="greekheb">Φθίνων</span>, that is, <span class="greekheb">μὴν</span>, <span class="ital">the last part of the month:</span> thus <span class="greekheb">φθινόπωρον</span>, <span class="ital">the end of the autumn:</span> thence <span class="greekheb">δένδρον φθινοπωρινὸν</span>, <span class="ital">a tree of such art appearance as that which presents itself at the end of the autumn, without leaves and fruit</span>. There is here a gradation, consisting of four members. The first, and flowing from it the second, has reference to the fruit: the third, and flowing from it the fourth, has reference to the tree itself.—<span class="greekheb">ἄκαρπα</span>, <span class="ital">without fruit</span>) trees which produce nothing serviceable for food.—<span class="greekheb">δὶς</span>) <span class="ital">twice</span>; that is, entirely: with reference to their former state, and their Christian state.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκριζωθέντα</span>, <span class="ital">plucked up by the roots</span>) This is the last step in the process here mentioned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] For HOMONYMIA and PARONOMASIA, see Append.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] See Append.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - The next two verses carry on the description of the men in a running fire of epithets and figures, short, sharp, and piercing, corresponding also at certain points with <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13-17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear.</span> What is referred to appears not to be ordinary friendly gatherings or occasions for the interchange of affection, but the well-known <span class="accented">agapae</span>, or love-feasts, of the primitive Church, the meals provided in connection with the Lord's Supper, at which rich and poor sat down together. In adopting the rendering "spots," the English Version follows Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish, and is followed by some good interpreters on the ground that the term, though formally different, is essentially the same as that in <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>. The word itself, however, properly means "rocks," and therefore the point may be that their immoral conduct makes these men like treacherous reefs, on which their  fellows make shipwreck. So the Revised Version gives "hidden rocks" in the text, and transfers "spots" to the margin. The "without fear," which is usually attached to the third clause, is connected by some with the second, in which case it expresses the reckless, irreverent spirit in which these men joined in the sacred <span class="accented">agape.</span> The last clause, "feeding [or, 'pasturing'] themselves," describes them further as having no regard to the proper object of these love-feasts in ministering to Christian fellowship and the holy sense of brotherhood, but as using them simply as a means for the saris-faction of their own appetites and the furtherance of their own base ends. Compare the evils referred to by Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, and the description of the shepherds in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>. "They are like shepherds," says Humphry, "that have themselves for their flocks, feasting themselves, not their sheep, and doing this without fear of the chief Shepherd, who has his eye upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds;</span> or, <span class="accented">carried past by winds.</span> Like rainless clouds, the sport of the uncertain breezes, yielding nothing for the fruitfulness of earth, these empty, volatile, inconstant men disappoint the expectation of the Church and do it no service. Trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. The Authorized Version is less happy than usual in its rendering of the first clause. The Revised Version, in adopting "autumn trees" instead of "trees whose fruit withereth," returns to the renderings of the earlier versions, Wickliffe giving "harvest trees," Tyndale and Cranmer "trees without fruit at gathering-time," and the Rhemish "trees of autumn." The idea of <span class="accented">uselessness</span> and <span class="accented">unfruitfulness</span>, which was expressed in the previous figure, is repeated, but in a more absolute form, in this new figure. The late autumn is not the time, from the Eastern point of view, for the putting forth of fruit. The tree then becomes bare, barren, leafless. So is it with these men. Nor is it only that they have no fruit to show. The capacity of fruitfulness is extinct within them. The possibility of recovering it is gone from them. They are as dead to all good service as trees are which are rooted out as hopelessly useless. The phrase, "twice dead," may mean no more than "utterly dead." The point, however, is rather this - that they are dead, not only in respect of barrenness - which is a death in life - but in respect of the extinction of all vitality. <span class="cmt_word">Raging</span> (or, <span class="accented">wild</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;</span> or <span class="accented">shames</span>, as the original gives it; that is to say, <span class="accented">shameful deeds</span>, or, it may be, the <span class="accented">degrading lusts</span> which inspire their unlicensed life (Huther). This comparison recalls at once the figure in <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wandering stars, to whom is</span> (or, <span class="accented">has been</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</span> In the Book of Enoch (chapter 18:14) the angel shows the prophet "a prison for the stars of heaven, and for the host of heaven," and in the next verse it is explained that "the stars that roll over the fire are they who have transgressed the command of God before their rising, because they did not come forth in their time." It is possible that Jude had this in mind here, as the language of earlier chapters of the same book may have suggested others of Jude's figures. If the "wandering stars" are to be identified with any particular order of the heavenly bodies, it will be with the comets rather than the planets, the movements of the former seeming, to the common eye, so much the more erratic. The doom which is declared to be in reserve, no doubt takes its form so far from the immediate figure of the comet vanishing into the unseen. But the idea expressed is not so much that of suddenness as that of certainty and irreversibility. It is the doom which Christ himself pronounces to be <span class="accented">prepared</span> (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>), and, therefore, inevitable and perpetual. In confirmation of this statement of the certainty of the doom, the readers are next reminded of the Lord's judicial coming, and of that as the subject of prophecy. The prophecy in question, though not one of those recorded in the canonical Hebrew Scriptures, seems to have been familiar enough to the readers to make it a natural and pertinent thing to quote it. So Paul cites heathen authors or common popular sayings in support of his statements. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/jude/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Spots (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
