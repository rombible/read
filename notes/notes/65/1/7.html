The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heed of, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul,<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha - Notes, <a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>.<p>And the cities about them - Admah and Zeboim, <a href="/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>. There may have been other towns, also, that perished at the same time, but these are particularly mentioned. They seem to have partaken of the same general characteristics, as neighboring towns and cities generally do.<p>In like manner - "In a manner like to these," (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ton homoion toutois tropon.) The Greek word "these," is in the plural number. There has been much diversity in interpreting this clause. Some refer it to the angels, as if it meant that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah committed sin in a way similar to the angels; some suppose that it refers to the wicked teachers about whom Jude was discoursing, meaning that Sodom and Gomorrah committed the same kind of sins which they did; some that the meaning is, that "the cities round about Sodom and Gomorrah" sinned in the same way as those cities; and some that they were punished in the same manner, and were set forth like them as an example. I see no evidence that it refers to the angels, and if it did, it would not prove, as some have supposed, that their sin was of the same kind as that of Sodom, since there might have been a resemblance in some respects, though not in all. I see no reason to believe, as Macknight holds, that it refers to "false teachers," since that would be to suppose that the inhabitants of Sodom copied their example long "before" the example was set. It seems to me, therefore, that the reference is to the cities round about Sodom; and that the sense is, that they committed iniquity in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom did, and were set forth in the same way as an example.<p>Going after strange flesh - Margin: "other." The reference seems to be to the unusual sin which, from the name Sodom, has been called "sodomy." Compare <a href="/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>. The meaning of the phrase "going after" is, that they were greatly addicted to this vice. The word "strange, or other," refers to that which is contrary to nature. Doddridge, however, explains it, "going after strange and detestable gratifications of their pampered and indulged flesh."<p>Are set forth for an example - They furnish a warning against all such conduct, and a demonstration that punishment shall come upon the ungodly. The condemnation of any sinner, or of any class of sinners, always furnishes such a warning. See the notes, <a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>.<p>Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire - The word rendered "suffering" (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  hupechousai) means, properly, "holding under" - as, for example, the hand; then to hold toward any one, as the ear - to give attention; then it is used as denoting to hold a discourse toward or with any one, or to hold satisfaction to any one, to make atonement; and then as "undergoing, paying, or suffering punishment," when united, as it is here, with the word &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  dike&#772;n (punishment, or vengeance). See "Rob. Lex." Here it expresses the idea of undergoing punishment. The word properly agrees in the construction with "cities," (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  poleis,) referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them; but the things affirmed relate to the "inhabitants" of those cities. The word "vengeance" means punishment; that is, such vengeance as the Lord takes on the guilty; not vengeance for the gratification of private and personal feeling, but like that which a magistrate appoints for the maintenance of the laws; such as justice demands. The phrase "eternal fire" is one that is often used to denote future punishment - as expressing the severity and intensity of the suffering. See the notes, <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>. As here used, it cannot mean that the fires which consumed Sodom and Gomorrah were literally eternal, or were kept always burning, for that was not true. The expression seems to denote, in this connection, two things:<p>(1) That the destruction of the cities of the plain, with their inhabitants, was as entire and perpetual as if the fires had been always burning - the consumption was absolute and enduring - the sinners were wholly cut off, and the cities forever rendered desolate; and,<p>(2) that, in its nature and duration, this was a striking emblem of the destruction which will come upon the ungodly. I do not see that the apostle here means to affirm that those particular sinners who dwelt in Sodom would be punished forever, for his expressions do not directly affirm that, and his argument does not demand it; but still the "image" in his mind, in the destruction of those cities, was clearly that of the utter desolation and ruin of which this was the emblem; of the perpetual destruction of the wicked, like that of the cities of the plain. If this had not been the case, there was no reason why he should have used the word "eternal" - meaning here "perpetual" - since, if in his mind there was no image of future punishment, all that the argument would have demanded was the simple statement that they were cut off by fire.<p>The passage, then, cannot be used to prove that the particular dwellers in Sodom will be punished forever - whatever may be the truth on that point; but that there is a place of eternal punishment, of which that was a striking emblem. The meaning is, that the case was one which furnished a demonstration of the fact that God will punish sin; that this was an example of the punishment which God sometimes inflicts on sinners in this world, and a type of that eternal punishment which will be inflicted in the next. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jude/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Admah and Zeboiim, for Zoar was spared. This is a third instance of God's vengeance on sinners; and which, like that of the Israelites, and of the angels, was after great favours had been enjoyed: these places were delightfully situated, and very fruitful, as the garden of God; they were under a form of government, had kings over them, and had lately had a very great deliverance from the kings that carried them captive, being rescued by Abraham; they had a righteous Lot among them, who was a reprover in the gate, and Abraham made intercession for them with God. But they <p>in like manner giving themselves over to fornication; not as the angels, who are not capable of sinning in such a manner; though the Jews make this to be a sin of theirs, and so interpret <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a> (i), but rather the Israelites, among whom this sin prevailed, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; though it seems best of all to refer it to the false teachers that turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, and were very criminal this way; and then the sense is, that in like manner as they, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, gave themselves over to the sin of fornication; wherefore these men might expect the same judgments that fell upon them, since their sin was alike; which sin is a work of the flesh, contrary to the law of God, is against the body, and attended with many evils; exposes to judgment here and hereafter, and unfits for the communion of the saints, and for the kingdom of heaven: <p>and going after strange flesh; or "other flesh"; meaning not other women besides their own wives, but men; and designs that detestable and unnatural sin, which, from these people, is called sodomy to this day; and which is an exceeding great sin, contrary to the light of nature and law of God, dishonourable to human nature, and scandalous to a nation and people, and commonly prevails where idolatry and infidelity do, as among the Papists and Mahometans; and arose from idleness and fulness of bread in Sodom, and was committed in the sight of God, with great impudence: their punishment follows, <p>are set forth for an example; being destroyed by fire from heaven, and their cities turned into a sulphurous lake, which continues to this day, as a monument of God's vengeance, and an example to all such who commit the same sins, and who may expect the same equitable punishment; and to all who live ungodly lives, though they may not be guilty of the same crimes; and to all that slight and reject the Gospel revelation, with whom it will be more intolerable than for Sodom and Gomorrah; and to antichrist, who bears the same name, and spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt; and particularly to all false teachers, who besides their strange doctrines, go after strange flesh: <p>suffering the vengeance of eternal fire; which may be understood of that fire, with which those cities, and the inhabitants of it, were consumed; which, Philo the (k) Jew says, burnt till his time, and must be burning when Jude wrote this epistle. The effects of which still continues, the land being now brimstone, salt, and burning; and is an emblem and representation of hell fire, between which there is a great likeness; as in the matter of them, both being fire; in the efficient cause of them, both from the Lord; and in the instruments thereof, the angels, who, as then, will hereafter be employed in the delivery of the righteous, and in the burning of the wicked; and in the circumstance attending both, suddenly, at an unawares, when not thought of, and expected; and in the nature of them, being a destruction total, irreparable, and everlasting: and this agrees with the sentiments of the Jews, who say (l), that "the men of Sodom have no part or portion in the world to come, and shall not see the world to come. <p>And says R.

Since, also, <span class="greekheb">τούτοις</span> cannot refer to the false teachers, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm" title2="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jude 1:4</a>, because, as de Wette correctly remarks, the thought of <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jude 1:8</a> would be anticipated, it must refer to the <span class="ital">angels</span> who, according to the Book of Enoch, sinned in a similar way as the inhabitants of those cities (thus Herder, Schneckenburger, Jachmann, de Wette, Arnaud, Hofmann, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκπορνεύσασαι</span>, the sin of the inhabitants, is designated as the action of the cities themselves. The verb (often in the LXX. the translation of <span class="greekheb">זָנָה</span>; also in the Apocrypha) is in the N. T. a <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. The preposition <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> serves for strengthening the idea, indicating that “one by <span class="greekheb">πορνεύειν</span> becomes unfaithful to true moral conduct” (Hofmann), but not that “he goes beyond the boundaries of nature” (Stier, Wiesinger, and similarly Schott).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπελθοῦσαι ὀπίσω σαρκὸς ἑτέρας</span>] The expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπέρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀπίσω τινός</span> is found in <a href="/mark/1-20.htm" title2="And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.">Mark 1:20</a> in its literal sense; here it has a figurative meaning; comp. <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title2="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

Stier, Schott, Hofmann proceed further, referring to <a href="/context/leviticus/18-23.htm" title2="Neither shall you lie with any beast to defile yourself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion....">Leviticus 18:23-24</a>, and accordingly explaining it: “not only have they practised shame man with man, but even man with beast” (Stier). Only this explanation corresponds to <span class="greekheb">σαρκὸς ἑτέρας</span>, and only by it do the connection of <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title2="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Jude 1:7</a> with <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>, expressed by <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, and the explanation: <span class="greekheb">τὸν ὅμοιον τρόπον τούτοις</span>, receive their true meaning. The <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> of men was <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρα σάρξ</span> to the angels, as that of beasts is to men. In the parallel passage, <a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm" title2="And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample to those that after should live ungodly;">2 Peter 2:6</a>, the sin of the cities is not stated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρόκεινται δεῖγμα πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκην ὑπέχουσαι</span>] <span class="greekheb">πρόκεινται</span>: they lie before the eyes as a <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span>; not: “inasmuch as the example of punishment in its historical attestation is ever present” (Schott); but: inasmuch as the Dead Sea continually attests that punishment, which Jude considers as enduring. There is a certain boldness in the expression, as properly it is not the cities and their inhabitants who are <span class="greekheb">πρόκεινται</span>. The genitive <span class="greekheb">πυρὸς αἰωνίου</span> may grammatically depend both on <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span> and on <span class="greekheb">δίκην</span>. Most expositors (particularly Wiesinger, Schott, Brückner) consider the second construction as the correct one; but hardly rightly; as (1) <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span> would then lose its exact definition; (2) <span class="greekheb">πῦρ αἰώνιον</span> always designates hell-fire, to which the condemned are delivered up at the last judgment (see <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm" title2="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>); (3) the juxtaposition of this verse with <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>, where the present punitive condition of the angels is distinguished from that which will occur after the judgment, favours the idea that the cities (or rather their inhabitants) are here not designated as those who even now suffer the punishment of eternal fire.[23] But Jude could designate the cities as a <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span> of eternal fire, considering the fire by which they were destroyed as a figure of eternal fire. Hofmann correctly connects <span class="greekheb">πυρὸς αἰωνίου</span> with <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span>, but he incorrectly designates <span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα πυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἰων</span>. as a preceding apposition to <span class="greekheb">δίκην</span>: “it may be seen in them (<span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span> = exhibition) what is the nature of eternal fire, inasmuch as the fire that has consumed them is enduring in its after-operations;” by this explanation <span class="greekheb">πῦρ αἰώνιον</span> is deprived of its proper meaning. With <span class="greekheb">δίκην ὑπέχουσαι</span> the fact is indicated that they have continually to suffer punishment, since the period that punishment was inflicted upon them in the time of Lot;[24] corresponding to what is said of the angels in <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δεῖγμα</span> in N.

It is also entirely erroneous when it is asserted that <span class="greekheb">πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκη</span> is an evident type of hell-fire, since <span class="greekheb">πῦρ αἰώνιον</span> is itself hell-fire.

A subterranean fire was believed to exist under the Gehenna valley.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jude/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">the cities about them, in like manner … going after strange flesh</span>] The words describe the form of evil for which the cities of the plain have become a byword of infamy. In saying that this sin was like that of the angels, it is clearly implied that in the latter case also there was a degradation of nature, such as is emphasized in the words that “the sons of God went in unto the daughters of men” (<a href="/genesis/6-4.htm" title2="There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.">Genesis 6:4</a>). Impurity, and not simply or chiefly pride, as in the mediæval traditions represented in the poems of Cædmon and Milton, is thought of as the leading feature in the fall of the angels (<span class="ital">Book of Enoch</span>, c. 9).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">suffering the vengeance of eternal fire</span>] The words imply a reference to something more than the natural phenomena of the Dead Sea region. The fire which had destroyed them is thought of as being still their doom, as permanent as the “eternal fire” of <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm" title2="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>.

This example is closely connected with the immediately preceding by the even as with which the verse opens; which phrase expresses a likeness between the two cases, to wit, between the reservation of those angels in bonds for the final judgment, and the fate of those cities as subjects of the penal vengeance of God. Two of those cities of evil memory, <span class="cmt_word">Sodom and Gomorrah,</span> are mentioned by name. The other two, Admah and Zeboim, are included in the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">and the cities about them.</span> Attention is rightly called by some of the commentators to the remarkable frequency with which the case of Sodom and Gomorrah is brought forward, both in the New Testament and in the Old, and to the use which Paul makes of it (as he finds it cited by Isaiah) in the great argument of <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>. The sin charged against these cities is stated in express terms to have been the same in kind with that of the angels - the indulgence of passion contrary to nature. They are described as having in <span class="cmt_word">like manner with these</span> (that is, surely, in like manner with these angels just referred to; not, as some strangely imagine, with these men who corrupt the Church) <span class="cmt_word">given themselves over to fornication, and gone after strange flesh.</span> The verbs are selected to bring out the intense sinfulness of the sin - the one being a strong compound form expressing unreserved surrender, the other an equally strong compound form denoting a departure from the law of nature in the impurities practiced. The sin has taken its name from the city with which the Book of Genesis so fearfully connects its indulgence. It forms one of the darkest strokes in the terrible picture which Paul has given us of the state of the ancient heathen  world (<a href="/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>). With the Dead Sea probably in his view, the writer describes the doom of the cities as an <span class="accented">example</span> of or a <span class="accented">witness</span> to (the noun used being one that occurs again only in <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, and bearing either sense) the retributive justice of God. They are <span class="cmt_word">set forth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they lie before</span> us) <span class="cmt_word">for an example, suffering the vengeance</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the punishment</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of eternal fire.</span> So it is put by the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, as also by Wickliffe, Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish. There is much to be said, however, in favour of the order adopted by the Revised Version in its margin, viz. "set forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment." It could not, except in a forced manner, be said that these cities, in being destroyed as they were, suffered the penalty of <span class="accented">eternal</span> fire, and continued to serve as an instance of that. But it could be said that, in being destroyed, they suffered punishment, and that the kind of punishment was typical of the eternal retribution of God.

Some of the best modern expositors render are set forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment. This meaning seems, on the whole, more natural, though the Greek construction favors the others, since eternal fire is the standing term for the finally condemned in the last judgment, and could hardly be correctly said of Sodom and Gomorrah. Those cities are most truly an example of eternal fire. "A destruction so utter and so permanent as theirs has been, is the nearest approach that can be found in this world to the destruction which awaits those who are kept under darkness to the judgment of the great day" (Lumby). Suffering (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). Only here in New Testament. The participle is present, indicating that they are suffering to this day the punishment which came upon them in Lot's time. The verb means, literally, to hold under; thence to uphold or support, and so to suffer or undergo. </body></html>
