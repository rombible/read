Three instances of God’s vengeance: the unbelievers in the wilderness; the impure angels; Sodom and Gomorrha.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">I will therefore put you in remembrance</span>.—Or, <span class= "ital">But I wish to remind you.</span> The “but” indicates opposition to the impiety of those just mentioned.<p><span class= "bld">Though ye once knew this.</span>—The best MSS. and versions compel us to substitute “all things” for “this,” and we must translate, <span class= "ital">because ye have once for all</span> (as in <a href="/jude/1-3.htm" title2="Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.">Jude 1:3</a>) <span class= "ital">known all things. Y</span>ou have once for all been taught all that I want to say to you; so that I need only remind you, there is no need to instruct. (Comp. <a href="/context/romans/15-14.htm" title2="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14-15</a>, where see Notes; <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm" title2="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title2="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1John 2:21</a>.) “All things” probably has special reference to Old Testament history, as what follows seems to show.<p><span class= "bld">How that the</span> <span class= "bld">Lord.</span>—“How that” depends upon “remind,” not upon “have known.” There is very strong evidence in favour of substituting “Jesus” for “the Lord;” a most remarkable reading, showing how, in Christian language, the Man Jesus had become identified with the Eternal Son. The use of “Christ” in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title2="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, though less striking, is similar.<p><span class= "bld">Having saved the people.</span>—Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">having saved a people.</span> A whole nation was rescued. The order of the three examples of signal punishment is in 2 Peter chronological: impure angels, flood, Sodom and Gomorrha; here not. But the order here is quite intelligible. St. Jude’s main object is to warn his readers against that party in the Christian community who, by its abuse of Christian liberty, transformed the gospel of purity into a gospel of wantonness, and to give them a safeguard against such. And the safeguard is this: to hold fast the faith once for all delivered to them, and to remember the consequences of being unbelieving. For this purpose, no warning could be more apposite than the fate of Jude’s own nation in the wilderness. This palmary instance given, two others follow, probably suggested by 2 Peter.<p><span class= "bld">Afterward destroyed</span>.—Better, <span class= "ital">secondly destroyed.</span> Wiclif, “the secunde tyme”; Rheims, “secondly.” The Lord twice manifested His power on Israel: (1) in mercy; (2) in judgment. The reference is almost certainly to <a href="/numbers/14-35.htm" title2="I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.">Numbers 14:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-35.htm" title2="Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers.">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>, &c. The destruction of Jerusalem can scarcely be meant, whatever date we assign to the Epistle, although the striking reading, “Jesus” for “the Lord,” gives some countenance to such an interpretation. The most obvious meaning is, that the people destroyed were those who, in the first instance, were saved. Had the destruction of Jerusalem been intended, the reference would probably have been more clear.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">And the angels which kept not.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">because they kept not.</span> The construction is similar to that in <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm" title2="But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.">Matthew 18:25</a>, “Forasmuch as he had not to pay.” (See Note on <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.) This second instance of the impure angels has nothing to do with the original rebellion of Satan, or “fall of the angels.” The reference is either to <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm" title2="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a>, or (more probably), to passages in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch.</span> (See <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of this Epistle.)<p><span class= "bld">Their first estate</span>.—The Greek word has two meanings: (1) beginning, which our translators have adopted here; (2) rule or power, which would be better. Wiclif has “prinshood;” Rheims, “principalitie.” The word is translated “rule” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title2="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>) and “principality” (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title2="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title2="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title2="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title2=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title2=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title2=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm" title2="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,">Titus 3:1</a>). The term belongs to the Jewish classification of angels, and here refers rather to their <span class= "ital">power</span> over things earthly than to the <span class= "ital">beginning</span> of their state. The two meanings are but two views of the same fact: their power or dignity <span class= "ital">was</span> their first estate. Some explain the word of the power of God over the angels; but both wording and context are against this.<p><span class= "bld">Their own habitation</span>.—<span class= "ital">Their proper home.</span> By leaving heaven and coming down to earth, they lost their power over the earth. (Comp. Milton’s <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>Book 5)<p><span class= "bld">He hath reserved.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">He hath kept, </span>in ironical contrast to “which kept not” just above: the same Greek word is used in both cases. This ironical contrast does not exist in the parallel passage, <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>. Would a writer, quite willing to copy, have failed to copy this? On the other hand, what more natural than that St. Jude should add a forcible touch?<p><span class= "bld">In everlasting chains.</span>—Speculations as to how this and <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a> are to be reconciled with such texts as <a href="/luke/22-31.htm" title2="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title2="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>, which speak plainly of the freedom and activity of Satan, and <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>, <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title2="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title2=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, which imply numerous agents akin to him, are not very profitable. The reality of powers of evil may be inferred, apart from Scripture, from their effects. That some of these powers are personal, some not, some free, some not, and that all are to be defeated at last, seems to be implied in Scripture; but its silence is a rebuke to curious speculation. Enough is told us for our comfort, warning, and assurance. It consoles us to know that much of the evil of which we are conscious in ourselves is not our own, but comes from without. It puts us on our guard to know that we have such powers arrayed against us. It gives us confidence to know that we have abundant means of victory even over them.<p><span class= "bld">Under darkness.</span>—The Greek word occurs only here, <a href="/jude/1-13.htm" title2="Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.">Jude 1:13</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2Peter 2:17</a>, and possibly <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm" title2="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18</a>.

St. John’s expression is the “last day” (<a href="/context/john/6-39.htm" title2="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm" title2="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="/john/6-54.htm" title2="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>; <a href="/john/11-24.htm" title2="Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.">John 11:24</a>; <a href="/john/12-48.htm" title2="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.">John 12:48</a>; and nowhere else). “The day of judgment,” “that day,” and “the day of the Lord,” are other common expressions.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Even as.</span>—Or, possibly, <span class= "ital">how, </span>like “how that” in <a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.">Jude 1:5</a>, depending upon “put you in remembrance.” Sodom and Gomorrha are typical instances of divine vengeance both in the Old and New Testament (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm" title2="And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-40.htm" title2="As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.">Jeremiah 50:40</a>; <a href="/romans/9-29.htm" title2="And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like to Gomorrha.">Romans 9:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the cities about them.</span>—Adma and Zeboim (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title2="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm" title2="How shall I give you up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver you, Israel? how shall I make you as Admah? how shall I set you as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.">Hosea 11:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In like manner.</span>—We must read, <span class= "ital">in like manner to these, </span>and arrange the sentence thus: <span class= "ital">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them, giving themselves over to fornication in like manner to these.</span> Who are meant by “these”?

The punishment of the submerged cities is perpetual; moreover, there are appearances as of volcanic fire under them. The Greek for “undergoing” occurs here only in the New Testament; but comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-48.htm" title2="Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for the people, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.">2 Maccabees 4:48</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jude/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will therefore put you in remembrance, &c. </span>— I will remind you of some examples of God’s judgments against such persons. Œcumenius observes, that “by proposing the following examples of the destruction of sinners from the Old Testament history, the apostle designed to show, that the God of the Old Testament is the same with the God of the New, in opposition to the Manicheans, who denied this; also to prove that the goodness of God will not hinder him from punishing the wicked under the new dispensation, any more than it hindered him from punishing them under the old.” In this passage Jude has mentioned two of the instances of the divine vengeance against atrocious sinners, which Peter took notice of, <a href="/context/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;...">2 Peter 2:4-5</a>, (where see the notes,) and in place of the third instance, the destruction of the old world, he hath introduced the destruction of the rebellious Israelites in the wilderness. <span class="ital">Though ye once knew this — </span>Were informed of it, and received it as a truth; <span class="ital">that the Lord, having saved the people out of Egypt — </span>By a train of wonderful miracles; <span class="ital">afterward destroyed them that believed not </span>— That is, destroyed the far greater part of that very people, whom he had once saved in a very extraordinary manner. Let no one, therefore, presume upon past mercies, as if he were now out of danger. Jude does not mention the various sins committed by the Israelites in the wilderness, such as their worshipping the golden calf, refusing to go into Canaan, when commanded of God, their fornication with the Midianitish women, their frequent murmurings, &c., but he sums up the whole in their <span class="ital">unbelief, </span>because it was the source of all their sins.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-7 Outward privileges, profession, and apparent conversion, could not secure those from the vengeance of God, who turned aside in unbelief and disobedience. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heed of, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul,<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will therefore put you in remembrance - "To show you what must be the doom of such men, I will call certain facts to your recollection, with which you are familiar, respecting the Divine treatment of the wicked in times past."<p>Though ye once knew this - That is, you were formerly made acquainted with these things, though they may not be now fresh in your recollection. On the different significations affixed to the word "once" in this place, see Bloomfield, "Crit. Digest, in loc." The thing which seems to have been in the mind of the apostle was an intention to call to their recollection, as bearing on the case before him, facts with which they had formerly been familiar, and about which there was no doubt. It was the thing which we often endeavor to do in argument - to remind a person of some fact which he once knew very well, and which bears directly on the case.<p>How that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt - Compare the notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-12</a>. The bearing of this fact on the case, before the mind of Jude, seems to have been this - that, as those who had been delivered from Egypt were afterward destroyed for their unbelief, or as the mere fact of their being rescued did not prevent destruction from coming on them, so the fact that these persons seemed to be delivered from sin, and had become professed followers of God would not prevent their being destroyed if they led wicked lives. It might rather be inferred from the example of the Israelites that they would be.<p>Afterward - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to deuteron - "the second;" that is, the second thing in order, or again. The expression is unusual in this sense, but the apostle seems to have fixed his mind on this event as a "second" great and important fact in regard to them. The "first" was that they were delivered; the second, that they were destroyed.<p>Destroyed them that believed not - That is, "on account" of their unbelief. They were not permitted to enter the promised land, but were cut off in the wilderness.

The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, "knew all things"; but rather it is to be restrained by the following instance of, God's vengeance on unbelievers; which with others is produced, to vindicate the divine conduct in the condemnation of the above persons, and to show that that is certain, and may be expected, since God has always dealt thus with such persons; and this they knew by reading of the Scriptures; at least they had known it once, though it might now be forgotten by them; and they had known it once for all; they had been perfectly acquainted with it; which is said, lest the apostle should be thought to write to persons ignorant, and rude in knowledge, and to show that he wrote nothing new and unheard of, and so should have the more weight and influence upon them; and he thought fit to remind them of it, though they had known it: it is one part of the work of the ministers of the word to put people in mind of what they have known; which is necessary, because of the inattentiveness of hearers, their forgetfulness, and loss of knowledge, and the weakness of some capacities to take in, and retain things; and if the judgment is not more informed hereby, yet the affections may be afresh raised, and grace be drawn out into exercise, and the mind be established and confirmed. The instance follows, <p>how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt; that is, the people of Israel, who were the chosen people of God, a special people, above all others, and had peculiar privileges; these the Lord brought out of the land of Egypt, with an high hand, and a mighty arm, and saved them out of their bondage, and delivered out of their oppressions and afflictions: the Alexandrian copy, and some others, the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions, instead of "the Lord", read "Jesus": and yet, though they were a special people, and notwithstanding this wonderful deliverance, and great salvation, he <p>afterward destroyed them that believed not; their carcasses fell in the wilderness by one judgment or another upon them; so that of all that came out of Egypt, but two entered into the land of Canaan: this shows the evil nature of unbelief; and that God will not suffer sin to go unobserved in any; no outward privileges and profession will screen any from divine vengeance; God sometimes makes severe examples of mere nominal professors; nor must false teachers, deniers of Christ, and perverters of his Gospel, expect to go free: moreover, it may be observed, that God may do great things for persons, and yet after all destroy them; great riches and honours may be conferred on some, great natural gifts on others; some may seem as if they had the grace of God, and were brought out of spiritual Egypt, and enjoy great mercies and favours, and have many deliverances wrought for them, and yet at last perish. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jude/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</span><p>(4) He presents the horrible punishment of those who have abused the grace of God to follow their own lusts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/jude/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>.

The name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΗΣΟῦς</span></span></span>, by which Christ is designated in His earthly and human personality, is, however, surprising; but Jude might have so used it from the consciousness that the eternal Son of God and He who was born of Mary is the same Person (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title2="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm" title2="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:">Php 2:5</a>).

It indicates that what was said in the preceding participial sentence, namely, the divine deliverance of the people from Egypt, is considered as a first deed, to which a second followed. The definite statement of what this second is, is usually derived from the preceding <span class="greekheb">σώσας</span>, and by it is accordingly understood a second deliverance; but there are different views as to what deliverance is meant. In this commentary the deliverance of the people from the wilderness was designated as this second deliverance, which certainly occurred to the people, yet only so that those who believed not did not attain to it, but were destroyed by God in the wilderness (so in essentials, Stier, Brückner, Wiesinger). On the other hand, Schmidt (<span class="ital">bibl. Theologie</span>, II.), Luthardt, Schott, Hofmann understand by it the deliverance effected by Christ; whilst they regard as the punishment falling on unbelievers, the destruction of Jerusalem, or the overthrow of the Jewish state. But both explanations are arbitrary; for, first, it is unauthorized to refer <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεύτερον</span> only to <span class="greekheb">σώσας</span> and not to <span class="greekheb">ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σώσας</span>; and, secondly, in the principal sentence a deliverance is not at all indicated.[17] Whilst, then, Jude thinks on the deliverance from Egypt as a first deed, he does not mention a deliverance, but the destruction of those who believed not, as the second deed following the first. But this second is not indicated as a single deed, and therefore by it is to be understood generally what befell the unbelieving in the wilderness after the deliverance from Egypt; what this was is expressed in the words <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μὴ πιστεύσαντας ἀπώλεσεν</span>. It is arbitrary to refer this, with Ritschl, only to the history recorded in <a href="/context/numbers/25-1.htm" title2="And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab....">Numbers 25:1-9</a>; and still more arbitrary to refer it, with Fronmüller, to the Babylonish captivity (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm" title2="But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.">2 Chronicles 36:16</a> ff.).

The judgment impending Over these men is borne witness to by well-known facts of the past, and may be illustrated from the phenomena of nature. God showed His mercy in delivering the Israelites from Egypt, but that was no guarantee against their destruction in the wilderness when they again sinned by unbelief. The angels were blessed beyond all other creatures, but when they proved unfaithful to their trust they were imprisoned in darkness, awaiting there the judgment of the great day. The men of Sodom (lived in a land of great fertility, they had received some knowledge of God through the presence and teaching of Lot, they had been lately rescued from captivity by Abraham, yet they) followed the sinful example of the angels, and their land is still a prey to the fire, bearing witness to the eternal punishment of sin. In spite of these warnings the heretics, who are now finding their way into the Church, persist in their wild hallucinations, giving themselves up to the lusts of the flesh, despising authority, and railing at angelic dignities. They might have been taught better by the example of the archangel Michael, of whom we are told that, when disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, he uttered no word of railing, but made his appeal to God. These men however rail at that which is beyond their knowledge, while they surrender themselves like brute beasts to the guidance of their appetites, and thus bring about their own destruction, following in the wake of impious Cain, of covetous Balaam, and rebellious Korah. When they take part in your love-feasts they cause the shipwreck of the weak by their wantonness and irreverence. In greatness of profession and smallness of performance they resemble clouds driven by the wind which give no rain; or trees in autumn on which one looks in vain for fruit, and which are only useful for fuel. By their confident speaking and brazen assurance they seem to carry all before the; yet like the waves bursting on the shore, the deposit they leave is only their own shame.

They are cited as typical examples of the Divine retribution, with which the readers can be taken to be familiar, and which they will recognize to give point to the terror of the condemnation overhanging the men in question. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The first is taken from the history of Israel. It is introduced, not as a contrast with what precedes, but as a natural transition from it. It is given, too, as a matter quite within their knowledge, and of which consequently they need only to be reminded. The Authorized Version is short of the mark in several respects here. What the writer expresses is not the mere fact that he is to do a certain thing, but that he has the wish to do so. Hence the <span class="cmt_word">now I desire to put you in remembrance</span> of the Revised Version is preferable to the <span class="accented">I will therefore</span>, etc., of the Authorized Version. The next clause is more decidedly astray. For the term rendered" once" means "once for all," and the knowledge is given as a present possession. Hence the rendering should be <span class="cmt_word">though ye know once for all;</span> or better, <span class="accented">knowing as ye do</span> once <span class="accented">for all</span> - a form of expression which might be paraphrased in our English idiom, as Mr. Humphry rightly observes, "though ye have known all along." There is, however, very considerable difficulty in the reading here. It varies between "ye know <span class="accented">this"</span> which is accepted by the Authorized Version, "ye know <span class="accented">all things"</span> which is preferred by the Revised Version, and "ye <span class="accented">all</span> know" which, though poorly accredited, is yet supposed by Professor Herr to be not improbably the original. The documentary evidence is, on the whole, on the side of "all things;" and if this is adopted, the universal term will naturally be limited by the context to a knowledge of all that is pertinent to the point in question. This knowledge of the principles at issue in the case of these evil men, and of the retributive deeds of God by which these principles have been signally vindicated, is a reason why Jude needs simply to refresh the memories of his readers, and not to tell them anything new. In the second half of the verse there is a still more serious difficulty in the text. Instead of the term "Lord," some of the very best authorities read "Jesus." If this must be accepted, we have an act of the Jehovah of the Old Testament ascribed to the <span class="accented">Jesus</span> of the New Testament. But this would be an entirely unexampled usage. For, while the New Testament not unfrequently introduces the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> when it refers to deeds of grace or claims of honour which the Old Testament connects with the name of Jehovah (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, etc.), it never does this with that name of the Redeemer of the New Testament which specially marks his human nature and origin. Hence Professor Herr speaks of the reading "Jesus" here as a blunder, however supported. The ordinary reading may, therefore, be adhered to, especially as it is by no means ill accredited, having on its side two of the primary uncials and other weighty authorities. These clauses are peculiar in other respects. They speak not of "the people" as the Authorized Version puts it, but rather of "a people." And this is not without its purpose. For the idea is not simply that the ancient Israel experienced both redemption and judgment at the hands of their Lord, but that Israel's Lord, by bringing Israel out of Egypt, secured a people for himself, though he had also to destroy unbelievers among them. Again, the phrase rendered "afterward" by the Authorized Version means strictly "the second time," as is noticed by the margin of the Revised Version. What is intended, therefore, may be that Israel was the subject of two great deeds on Jehovah's part  - in the first instance a redeeming deed, in <span class="accented">the second instance</span> a punitive deed. And his purpose in seeking a people for himself was not inconsistent with his doing what he did in this second instance. What, then, is referred to? Those seem to interpret it best who take it to be a general reference to the wilderness-fate of unbelieving Israel, rather than to any single instance of the terrors of the Divine judgment, such as that reported in <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-9</a>. It is far-fetched to suppose that the event in view is one so remote from the deliverance of Israel from Egypt as the Babylonian captivity. We may compare with this verse, therefore, such passages as <a href="/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12-21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-4:5</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/jude/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye once knew (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;)<p>Entirely wrong.
