Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now.

The Targum distinguishes them, and makes Nebuchadnezzar the ungodly to be the adversary; and Nebuzaradan the enemy, who entered to slay the people of the house of Israel, in the gates of Jerusalem; this was a marvellous thing to the nations round about.

The preaching of Isaiah, supported as it was by the overthrow of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-34.htm" title="For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.">2 Kings 19:34</a> f.), led to the belief, in spite of Jeremiah’s warnings, that Jerusalem could not be absolutely overthrown, a belief which the writer here evidently had shared. This circumstance of itself throws doubt upon Jeremiah’s authorship of this book. Jerusalem’s fortifications, in fact, had been much strengthened by Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>), Jotham (<span class="ital">ib</span>. <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>), and Manasseh (<span class="ital">ib</span>. <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm" title="Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth,</span> etc. And yet Jerusalem had been taken twice before its capture by Nebuchadnezzar (see <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>:131. How is the language of the second part to be accounted for? It will help us to an answer if we observe that the later Jews seem to have acquired an exorbitant confidence in their national future ever since the Book of Deuteronomy had become as it were canonical in the reign of Josiah. "The temple of Jehovah" was ever in their mouths (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>), and the strong outward regard paid to the directions of the Law seemed to them to justify their believing in the fulfilment of its promises. And, in fact, the grand deliverance of Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah might, even without this misunderstanding of Deuteronomy, have inspired a firm faith in the security of Jerusalem. A sacred poet had already, on the occasion of that deliverance, declared of the holy city that "God upholdeth the same forever" (<a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), and also (in vers. 4, 5) used the same hyperbole as the author of this lamentation to express the wide reaching interest felt in the fortunes of Jerusalem. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The greatness of their guilt is seen in this misery. The &#1493; consecutive joined with &#1497;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; here marks the result, so far as this manifests itself: "thus the offence (guilt) of the daughter of my people has become greater than the sin of Sodom." Most expositors take &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; dna  here in the sense of punishment; but this meaning has not been established. The words simply mean "offence" and "sin," sometimes including their consequences, but nowhere do they mean unceremonious castigation. But when Thenius is of opinion that the context demands the meaning "punishment" (not "sin"), he has inconsiderately omitted the &#1493; consec., and taken a wrong view of the context. &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; is the usual word employed in connection with the destruction of Sodom; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>, <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, etc. '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is translated by Thenius, et non torquebatur in ea manus, i.e., without any one wringing his hands. However, &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (to go in a circle) means to writhe with pain, but does not agree with &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, to wring the hands. In <a href="/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a> &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is used of the sword, which "circles" in the cities, i.e., cuts and kills all round in them. In like manner it is here used of the hands that went round in Sodom for the purpose of overthrowing (destroying) the city. Ngelsbach wrongly derives &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, to become slack, powerless. The words, "no hands went round (were at work) in her," serve to explain the meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, "as in a moment," without any need for the hands of men being engaged in it. By this additional remark, not merely is greater prominence given to the sudden destruction of Sodom by the hand of God; but it is also pointed out how far Jerusalem, in comparison with that judgment of God, suffers a greater punishment for her greater sins: for her destruction by the hand of man brings her more enduring torments. "Sodom's suffering at death was brief; for there were no children dying of hunger, no mothers who boiled their children" (Ngelsbach). Sodom was spared this heartrending misery, inasmuch as it was destroyed by the hand of God in an instant.</body></html>
