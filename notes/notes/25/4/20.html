The original reference seems to have been to Josiah (2Ch 35:25), killed in battle with Pharaoh-necho; but the language is here applied to Zedekiah, who, though worthless, was still lineal representative of David, and type of Messiah, the "Anointed."

We promised ourselves that though the land of Judah was encompassed with pagan nations, yet through Zedekiah’s valour and good conduct in government we should live comfortably, he being a covering and refreshing to us; but, saith the prophet, he also is fallen into the enemies’ hands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits,.... Or "the Messiah", or "the Christ of the Lord" (n); not Josiah, as the Targum; and so Jarchi and others; for though he was the Lord's anointed, and the life of the people, being the head of them, as every king is, especially a good one; yet he was slain, and not taken, and much less in their pits, and that not by the Chaldeans, but by the Egyptians; nor did the kingdom cease with him, or the end of the Jewish state then come, which continued some years after: but rather Zedekiah, as Aben Ezra and others, the last of the kings of Judah, with whom all agrees; he was the Lord's anointed as king, and the preserver of the lives and liberties of the people, at least as they hoped; but when the city was taken by the Chaldeans, and he fled for his life, they pursued him, and took him; he fell into their hands, their pits, snares, and nets, as was foretold he should; and which are sometimes called the net and snare of the Lord; see <a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>; See Gill on <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>. Many of the ancient Christian writers apply this to Christ; and particularly Theodoret takes it to be a direct prophecy of him and his sufferings. Vatablus, who interprets it of Josiah, makes him to be a type of Christ; as Calvin does Zedekiah, of whom he expounds the words; and the Targum, in the king of Spain's Bible, is, <p>"the King Messiah, who was beloved by us, as the breath of the spirit of life, which is in our nostrils.'' <p>What is here said may be applied to Christ; he is the life of men, he gives them life and breath, and in him they live and move; their spiritual life is from him, and is maintained and preserved by him; he lives in his people, and they in him, and they cannot live without him, no more than a man without his breath: he is the Christ of God, anointed with the Holy Ghost to the offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; and from whom Christians have their holy unction and their name: he was taken, not by the Chaldeans, but by the wicked Jews; who looked upon him as a very mischievous person, as if he had been an evil beast, a beast of prey, though the pure spotless Lamb of God; and they dug pits, laid snares, and formed schemes to take him, and at last did, and with wicked hands crucified him, and slew him; though not without his own and his Father's will and knowledge, <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <p>of whom we said, under his shadow we shall live among the Heathen; in the midst of the nations round about them, unmolested by them, none daring to meddle with them; at least safe from being carried captive, as now they were. Though Jeconiah was taken and carried into Babylon, yet Zedekiah being placed upon the throne, the Jews hoped to live peaceable and quiet lives under his government, undisturbed by their neighbours; the wise and good government of a prince, and protection under it, being sometimes compared in Scripture to the shadow of a rock or tree, <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; but now it was all over with them; their hope was gone, he being taken. Something like this may be observed in the disciples of Christ; they hoped he would have restored the kingdom to Israel, and they should have lived gloriously under his government; they trusted that it was he that should have redeemed Israel; but, when he was taken and crucified, their hope was in a manner gone, <a href="/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>. True believers in Christ do live peaceably, comfortably, and safely under him; they are among the Heathen, among the men of the world, liable to their reproaches, insults, and injuries; Christ is a tree, to which he is often compared, one and another, that casts a delightful, reviving, refreshing, and fructifying shadow, under which they sit with great delight, pleasure, and profit, Sol 2:3; he is a rock, the shadow of which affords rest to weary souls, and shelters from the heat of divine wrath, the fiery law of God, and darts of Satan, and persecutions of men, <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; and under his government, protection, and power, they dwell safely, that sin cannot destroy them, nor Satan devour them, nor the world hurt them; here they live spiritually, and shall never die eternally, <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>. <p>(n)  , Sept.

Cp. Seneca (<span class="ital">ad Neronem de Clementia</span>, I. 4) “He (the Emperor) is the breath of life, which these many thousand (subjects) draw.” As regards its application to Zedekiah individually we are to remember that whatever may have been his personal weaknesses (and he was weak rather than vicious), he was the one on whom the whole of the people’s hopes depended for the continuance of their national life. So “the romantic enthusiasm of Cavaliers and Non-jurors for the Stuarts was not to be accounted for by the merits and attractions of the various successive sovereigns and pretenders towards whom it was directed,” Adeney, <span class="ital">op. cit</span>. p. 298.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Of whom we said</span> …] The reference may very possibly be to a hope entertained by the fugitives that by escaping to the mountainous region of Moab or Ammon they might maintain in some sort their national existence under Zedekiah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breath of our nostrils.</span> The theocratic king was the direct representative of the people with Jehovah, and to him the promises of <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. were conveyed. He was also, in a sense, the representative of Jehovah with the people. His throne was "the throne of Jehovah" (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>). A similar conception of the king was generally prevalent in antiquity. Most of all among the Egyptians; but, even in imperial Rome, we find Seneca ('De Clementia,' 1:4, quoted by Archbishop Seeker, in Blayney) declaring, "Ille (Princeps) est spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt." For the Jewish, or Old Testament, conception, see <a href="/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>, where (as the Septuagint shows) "his people" and "his anointed" are used almost synonymously. <span class="cmt_word">Was taken in their pits.</span> A figure from hunting (comp. <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>).

The capture of Jerusalem by enemies (an event which none in all the world thought possible) has been brought on through the sins of the prophets and priests. The words, "the kings of the earth...did not believe that an enemy would come in at the gates of Jerusalem," are well explained by C. B. Michaelis, thus: reputando fortitudinem urbis, quae munitissima erat, tum defensorem ejus Jehovam, qui ab hostibus, ad internecionem caesis, urbem aliquoties, mirifice liberaverat, e.g., 2 Reg. 19:34. The words certainly form a somewhat overdrawn expression of deep subjective conviction; but they cannot properly be called a hyperbole, because the remark of Ngelsbach, that Jerusalem had been taken more than once before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>.; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>.), seems incorrect. For the occasions upon which Jerusalem was taken by Shishak and by Joash king of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14.htm">1 Kings 14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>) belong to those earlier times when Jerusalem was far from being so strongly fortified as it afterwards became, in the times of Uzziah, Jotham, and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>, on the other hand, there is nothing said of Jerusalem being taken; and the capture by Pharaoh-Necho does not call for consideration, in so far as it forms the beginning of the catastrophe, whose commencement was thought impossible. Ewald wrongly connects <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> with <a href="/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a> into one sentence, thus: "that an enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem because of the sins of her prophets," etc. The meaning of these verses is thereby not merely weakened, but also misrepresented; and there is ascribed to the kings and inhabitants of the world an opinion regarding the internal evils of Jerusalem, which they neither pronounced nor could have pronounced.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12-14</a><p><a href="/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a> contains an exclamation over the incredible event that has happened, and <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> assigns the cause of it: the mediating and combining thought, "this incredible thing has happened," suggests itself. It has taken place on account of the sins of her prophets and priests, who have shed the blood of righteous men in Jerusalem. A historic proof of this is furnished in <a href="/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>., where priests and prophets indicted Jeremiah on a capital charge, because he had announced that Jerusalem and the temple would suffer the fate of Shiloh; from this, Ngelsbach rightly concludes that, in any case, the burden of the guilt of the martyr-blood that was shed falls on the priests and prophets. Besides this, cf. the denunciations of the conduct of the priests and prophets in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-10.htm">Jeremiah 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-15.htm">Lamentations 4:15</a>, there is described the fate of these priests and prophets, but in such a way that Jeremiah has, throughout, mainly the priests before his mind. We may then, without further hesitation, think of the priests as the subject of &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, inasmuch as they are mentioned last. Kalkschmidt wrongly combines <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, thus: "because of the sins of the prophets...they wander about," etc.; in this way, the Israelites would be the subject to &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, and in <a href="/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a> the calamitas ex sacerdotum prophetarumque sceleribus profecta would be described. This, however, is contradicted, not merely by the undeniable retrospection of the expression, "they have polluted themselves with blood" (<a href="/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>), to the shedding of blood mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a>, but also by the whole contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, especially the impossibility of touching their clothes, which does not well apply to the people of Israel (Judah), but only to the priests defiled with blood. Utterly erroneous is the opinion of Pareau, Ewald, and Thenius, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14-16</a> there is "presented a fragment from the history of the last siege of Jerusalem," - a rupture among the besieged, headed by the most eminent of the priests and prophets, who, filled with frenzy and passion against their fellow-citizens, because they would not believe in the speedy return of the exiles, became furious, and caused their opponents to be murdered. Regarding this, there is neither anything historical known, nor is there any trace of it to be discovered in these verses. The words, "prophets and priests hesitated (or wavered) like blind men on the streets, soiled with blood, so that none could touch their clothes," merely state that these men, smitten of God in consequence of their blood-guiltiness, wandered up and down in the streets of the city, going about like blind men. This description has been imitated from such passages as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:28</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>, where the people, and especially their leaders, are threatened, as a punishment, with blind and helpless staggering; but it is not to be referred to the time of the last siege of Jerusalem. &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean caedium perpetrandarum insatiabili cupiditate occaecati (Rosenmller), nor "as if intoxicated with blood that has been shed" (Ngelsbach), but as if struck with blindness by God, so that they could no longer walk with firm and steady step. "They are defiled with blood" is a reminiscence from <a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>. As to the form &#1504;&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;, compounded of the Niphal and Pual, cf. Ewald, 132, b, and Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, without one being able, i.e., so that one could not. As to the construction of &#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500; with a finite verb following, instead of the infinitive with &#1500;, cf. Ewald, 285, c, c, and Gesenius, 142, 3, b.</body></html>
