Or, O ye "unclean" (e); that is, the people said so to the priests, being polluted with blood; they abhorred them, did not care they should come nigh them, but bid them keep at distance; they that cleansed others of leprosy were treated as leprous persons themselves, and proclaimed unclean, and shunned as such: and, to show their vehement abhorrence of them, repeated the words, <p>depart, depart, touch not: that is, touch us not; they who had used to say; to others, stand by yourselves, we are more holy than you, being the Lord's priests and prophets, are treated after the same manner themselves: <p>when they fled away, and wandered; fled from the city, and wandered among the nations; or when they were swiftly carried away captives, and became vagabonds in other countries: <p>they said among the Heathens, they shall no more sojourn there; being among the Heathens, they took notice of them as very wicked men, and said concerning them, now they are carried out of their own land, they shall never return there any more, and dwell in Jerusalem, and officiate in the temple, as they had formerly done. <p>(e) "immunde", Montanus; "immundi", Strigelius.

Theirs was a moral leprosy. The <span class="ital">v</span>., as it stands, is too long from the metrical point of view and so probably includes one or more glosses. Moreover the Heb. for “fled away” occurs here only. By the change of a consonant we get the root rendered (R.V.) “wanderer” in <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm" title="When you till the ground, it shall not from now on yield to you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth.">Genesis 4:12</a>. “The fate of Cain falls upon those who were guilty of his sin.” Pe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">When</span>] perhaps as mg. <span class="ital">Yea</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they fled away and wandered, etc</span>.] <span class="ital">when they fled away</span>, <span class="bld">then they</span> <span class="ital">wandered</span>.

It is <span class="cmt_word">unclean</span>. The cry with which the leper was directed to warn off passengers, lest they should become infected (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>). There may be an allusion to this, but, though commonly accepted, the view is not certain, as the" leper" in the present case is not the person who raises the cry, but those who meet him. <span class="cmt_word">When they fled away and wandered.</span> The clause is difficult. If the text is correct, Keil's explanation may perhaps pass, "When they fled away, (there) also they wandered," alluding to the "wandering" ascribed to them with a somewhat different shade of meaning in the preceding verso. In any case there ought to be a fuller stop than a comma after "touch not," which words close the first of the two parallel lines of which the verse consists. But very probably "when" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ki</span>) is an intrusion, and we should begin the second line thus: "They fled, they also wandered about." <span class="cmt_word">They said among the heathen,</span> etc. Even in their place of exile they found no rest (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>). This is better than understanding "the heathen" (literally, <span class="accented">the nations</span>) to mean "the Chaldean army," and the place of sojourn prohibited to be Jerusalem. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This pining away with hunger is much more horrible than a speedy death by the sword. &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501;, "for they"  equals  qui ipsi; &#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, prop. flow away, i.e., pine away as those pierced through (&#1502;&#1491;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/37-10.htm">Jeremiah 37:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-4.htm">Jeremiah 51:4</a>).

The free rendering of the Vulgate, consumpti a sterilitate terrae, gives no support to the conjecture.</body></html>
