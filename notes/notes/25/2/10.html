The liver is the proper seat of the bile, where its secretions are carried on. Hence the prophet’s meaning in this place seems to be, that he felt as if his whole liver was dissolved and carried off in bile, on account of the copious discharge brought on by continual vexation and fretting. Job expresses the same thing, <a href="/job/16-13.htm" title="His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.">Job 16:13</a>, where he says, <span class="ital">He poureth out my gall upon the ground.” Because the children and sucklings swoon in the streets — </span>For want of sustenance. <span class="ital">As the wounded — </span>As those who are not presently despatched, but die a lingering death. <span class="ital">What thing shall I take to witness for thee? — </span>What instance can I bring of any calamity like thine, that such an example may be some mitigation of thy complaints. <span class="ital">For thy breach is great, like the sea, </span>&c. — The breach made in thee is like the breaking in of the sea that overflows a whole country, where no stop can be put to the inundation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her gates are sunk into the ground - So completely destroyed, that one might suppose they had been swallowed up in an abyss.<p>Her king - The prophet's lamentation, occupied before chiefly with the buildings of the city and temple, now turns to the people, beginning with their temporal rulers.<p>The law is no more - The Jewish Law, the Torah, came to an end when it no longer had a local habitation.

The meaning of this whole verse is, that the whole city of Jerusalem was in a very sad state and condition, and all persons in it in a mournful posture; not the common people only, but the gravest of their magistracy and ministry, those who were wont to sit in the chairs of magistracy and of teachers. Their young women also, which used to be most brisk and frolic, those whose condition was furthest off from sorrow, and who were least disposed to it, were now all of them drowned in floods of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, and keep silence,....

Thenius utterly mistakes the poetic character of the description given, and evidently finds in it the several events that occurred up to the taking of the city, all mentioned in their natural order; according to this, the perfects would require to be translated as preterites. But this view can be made out only by giving an arbitrary meaning to the several figures used; e.g., it is alleged that "every horn" means the frontier fortresses, that the expression "before the enemy" refers to the time when the latter turned his face against Jerusalem, and so on. The three members of <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a> contain a climax: deprivation of the power to resist; the withdrawal of aid; the necessary consequence of which was the burning like a flame of fire. "To cut down the horn" means to take away offensive and defensive power; see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>. "Every horn" is not the same as "all horns," but means all that was a horn of Israel (Gerlach). This included not merely the fortresses of Judah, but every means of defence and offence belonging to the kingdom, including men fit for war, who are neither to be excluded nor (with Le Clerc) to be all that is understood by "every horn." In the expression &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;...&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, the suffix, as in &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>, refers to Jahveh, because the suffix joined to &#1497;&#1491; always points back to the subject of the verb &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;; cf. <a href="/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11</a>. God drew back His hand before the enemy, i.e., He withdrew from the people His assistance in the struggle against the enemy. Such is the meaning given long ago by the Chaldee: nec auxiliatus est populo suo coram hoste. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; does not mean "He consumed Jacob;" but He burned (i.e., made a conflagration) in Jacob; for, in every passage in which &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is construed with &#1489;&#1468;, it does not mean to "burn something," but to burn in or among, or to kindle a fire (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>, where the burning up is only expressed by &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="/numbers/11-3.htm">Numbers 11:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-18.htm">Psalm 106:18</a>), or to set something on fire, <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>. The burning represents devastation; hence the comparison of &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; with "like fire of flame ( equals  flaming, brightly blazing fire, cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>) that devours round about." The subject of &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; is Jahveh, not ira Jovae (Rosenmller), or &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492; (Neumann), or the enemy (Gerlach). The transition from the perfect with &#1493; consec. does not cause any change of the subject; this is shown by <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a>, where also the second clause is connected with the first by means of &#1493; consec. But the statement of Gerlach - that if Jahveh and not the enemy be the subject, then the consecutive sentence (the burning among Jacob as the result of the withdrawal of Jahveh's hand before the enemy) would be inexplicable - gives no evidence of its truth. The kindling or making of the fire in Jacob is, of course, represented as a result of what is previously stated, yet not as the consequence merely of the withdrawal of his hand, but also of the cutting off of every horn. In both of these ways, God has kindled in Jacob a fire which grows into a destructive conflagration. - In <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a> the idea is still further developed: God not merely delivered up His people to the enemy, leaving them defenceless and helpless, but also came forward Himself to fight against them as an enemy. He bent His bow like a warrior, showing Himself, in reference to His claims, as an adversary or oppressor. The specification "His right hand" is added, not so much for the purpose of defining more exactly the activity of the right hand (using it to shoot the arrows or wield the sword; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>., <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>.), as rather with the view of expressing more precisely the hostile attitude of God, since the right hand of God is at other times represented as the instrument of help. The expression "and He slew," which follows, does not require us to think of a sword in the right hand of God, since we can also kill with arrows. God slew as an enemy; He destroyed everything that was precious in men's sight, i.e., to merely omnes homines aetate, specie, dignitate conspicuos (C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Thenius); for, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>, &#1495;&#1512;&#1490; is also used with reference to the effect of hail on the vine; and the arrows shot from the bow are merely named by synecdoche, and by way of specification, as instruments of war for destruction. Still less can &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; signify omnia ea templi ornamenta, quibus merito gloriabatur populus (Kalkschmidt), since it is not till <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>. that the temple is spoken of. "The word is to be taken in its widest generality, which is indicated by 'all;' accordingly, it comprehends everything that can be looked upon as dear," including children (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25</a>) and the sanctuary, though all these do not exhaust the meaning of the word (Gerlach). Upon the tent of the daughter of Zion He poured out His fury in fire. The daughter of Zion means the inhabitants of Jerusalem: her tent is not the temple (Kalkschmidt, Ewald), which is never called the tent of the daughter of Zion, but only that of Jahveh (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>, etc.); but her house, i.e., the city as a collection of dwellings. The figure of the outpouring of wrath is often used, not only in <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>, etc., but also in <a href="/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>, etc.</body></html>
