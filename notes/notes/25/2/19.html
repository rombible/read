Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done.

The second was called "the middle watch" (Jud 7:19), from ten till two o'clock. The third, "the morning watch," from two to sunrise (Ex 14:24; 1Sa 11:11).

That is, O daughter of Zion, or congregation of Israel, as the Targum; who are addressed and called upon by the prophet to arise from their beds, and shake off their sleep, and sloth, and stupidity, and cry to God in the night season; and be earnest and importunate with him for help and assistance. Aben Ezra rightly observes, that the word used signifies a lifting up of the voice both in singing and in lamentation; here it is used in the latter sense; and denotes great vehemency and earnestness in crying unto God, arising from deep distress and sorrow, which prevents sleep: <p>in the beginning of the watches; either at the first of them; so Broughton renders it, "at the first watch"; which began at the time of going to bed: or at the beginning of each of them; for with the ancient Jews there were three of them; in later times four: or in the beginning of the morning watch, as the Targum; very early in the morning, before sun rising; as they are called upon to pray late at night, so betimes in the mottling: <p>pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord; use the utmost freedom with him; tell him, in the fullest manner, thy whole case, fit thy complaints; unbosom thyself to him; keep nothing from him; speak out freely all lily soul needs; do all this publicly, and in the most affectionate way and manner, thy soul melted in floods of tears, under a sense of sin, and pressing evils for it. The Targum is, <p>"pour out as water the perverseness of thine heart, and return by repentance, and pray in the house of the congregation (or synagogue) before the face of the Lord:'' <p>lift up thine hands towards him; in prayer, as the Targum adds; for this is a prayer gesture, as in <a href="/lamentations/3-41.htm">Lamentations 3:41</a>; <p>for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street; pray for them, that they might have food and sustenance, to preserve them alive; who, for want of it, were ready to swoon and die the public streets; in the top of them, where they met, and where was the greatest concourse of people, and yet none able to relieve them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

In New Testament times the Jews had adopted the Roman division of the night into four watches of three hours each (see <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm" title="And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="/mark/13-35.htm" title="Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:">Mark 13:35</a>). Up to that time the division was threefold, each consisting of four hours. Cp. <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,">Exodus 14:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-6.htm" title="When I remember you on my bed, and meditate on you in the night watches.">Psalm 63:6</a>, etc. The watchman’s cry would rouse the sleeper to realise afresh the miseries of the situation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Pour out thine heart like water</span>] Cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm" title="My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.">Lamentations 2:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Lift up thy hands</span>] in supplication.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the watches</span>. This would seem to be most naturally explained as referring to the first watch of the night. When most are wrapped in their first and sweetest sleep, the daughter of Zion is to "arise and cry." Others explain, "at the beginning of each of the night watches;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the night through. Previously to the Roman times, the Jews had divided the night into three watches (comp. <a href="/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Pour out thine heart like water;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> give free course to thy complaint, shedding tears meanwhile. The expression is parallel partly to phrases like "I am poured out like water" (<a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>), partly to "Pour out your heart before him" (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the top of every street;</span> rather, <span class="accented">at every street corner</span> (and so <a href="/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Against such terrible misery, human power can give neither comfort nor help. "What shall I testify to you?" the Kethib &#1488;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498; is a mistake in transcription for &#1488;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; (Qeri), because &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is not commonly used in the Kal. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;, to bear witness, is mostly construed with &#1489;&#1468;, against or for any one, but also with acc., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>, in malam, and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-11.htm">Job 29:11</a>, in bonam partem. Here it is used in the latter sense: "give testimony to thee" for the purpose of instruction and comfort, - not of a calamity that has happened elsewhere, as Calvin and Thenius explain, though against the construction of the verb with the accus.; still less "to make one swear" (Gesenius, Ewald). That the prophetic witness is meant here in the sense of encouragement by instruction, warning, and comfort, is evident from the mention of the testimony of the false prophets in <a href="/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>. "What shall I compare to thee?" i.e., what kind of misfortune shall I mention as similar to yours? This is required by the principle derived from experience: solamen miseris socios habuisse malorum. &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1498;, "that I may comfort thee." The reason assigned, viz., "for thy destruction is great, like the sea" (i.e., immense), follows the answer, understood though not expressed, "I can compare nothing to thee." The answer to the last question, "Who can heal thee?" (&#1512;&#1508;&#1488; with &#1500;) is, "no man;" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/30-12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12</a>. Reasons are assigned for this in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14-16</a>.</body></html>
