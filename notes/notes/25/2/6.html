It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them.

The natural sense of the Eng. would be that He has taken away His tabernacle (the Temple) out of Jerusalem as unconcernedly as a pleasure booth might be removed from a garden (cp. <a href="/job/27-18.htm" title="He builds his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper makes.">Job 27:18</a>). But <span class="ital">as a garden</span> is a better rendering of the Heb., and so we get the thought that the Temple was destroyed and broken up with as much ease as a garden that had failed to please its owner. The fact that the LXX has <span class="ital">as a vine</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">gephen</span>) while the Heb. as it stands has <span class="ital">gan, a garden</span>, has led to the conjecture (so de Hoop Scheffer) that <span class="ital">gannab, a thief</span>, was the original reading. On this hypothesis the MT. might easily have been altered, if considered as an indecorous comparison, into one of the other two words. If we accept Scheffer’s view we must understand that Jehovah has broken through the <span class="ital">hedge</span> (see mg.) which protected Zion, as a thief would make his way through a hedge in order to steal property which it protected. Secrecy rather than violence, however, is what we associate with theft (cp. <a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm" title="If grape gatherers come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.">Jeremiah 49:9</a>), and so far the comparison is inappropriate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">place of assembly</span>] The same word in the Heb. as that which is immediately afterwards rendered <span class="ital">solemn assembly</span> (mg. <span class="ital">appointed feast</span>) which is its usual sense, although the former one occurs <a href="/psalms/64-8.htm" title="So they shall make their own tongue to fall on themselves: all that see them shall flee away.">Psalm 64:8</a>. The occurrence of the same word in somewhat different senses in two consecutive clauses is suspicious, but no very satisfactory emendation has been suggested.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the king</span>] associated here with the priest by virtue of his theocratic character. Cp. <a href="/lamentations/4-20.htm" title="The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.">Lamentations 4:20</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violently taken away;</span> rather, <span class="accented">violently treated; i.e.</span> broken up. <span class="cmt_word">His tabarnacle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his booth.</span> "Tent" and "dwelling" are interchangeable expressions (see ver. 4); and in the Psalms "booth" is used as a special poetic synonym for tent when God's earthly dwelling place, the sanctuary of the temple, is spoken of (so <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>). The Authorized Version, indeed, presumes an allusion to the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, as if the poet compared the sanctuary of Jehovah to a pleasure booth in a garden. It is, however, more natural to continue, <span class="accented">as a garden</span>, the sense of which will be clear from <a href="/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12, 13</a>. The Septuagint has, instead, "as a vine" - a reading which differs from the Massoretic by having one letter more (<span class="accented">kaggefen</span> instead of <span class="accented">kaggan</span>). This ancient reading is adopted by Ewald, and harmonizes well with <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>); but the received text gives a very good sense. "Garden" in the Bible means, of course, a plantation of trees rather than a flower garden. <span class="cmt_word">His places of the assembly;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his place of meeting</span> (<span class="accented">with God</span>). The  word occurs in the same sense in <a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>. It is the temple which is meant, and the term is borrowed from the famous phrase, <span class="accented">ohel mo'edh</span> (<a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; comp. 25:22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since neither comfort nor advice is to be found with men, Jerusalem makes her complaint of need to God the Lord. "See, Jahveh, that I am distressed. My bowels glow." &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, the passive enhancing form, from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, is found, besides, only in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, where the clause before us is repeated, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>, where it is used of the countenance, and can only mean to be glowing red; it is scarcely legitimate to derive it from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, Arab. h[mr, to be made red, and must rather be referred to Arab. chmr, to ferment, rise into froth; for even in <a href="/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a> &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; does not mean to be red, but to rise into froth. &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, "bowels," are the nobler portions of the internal organs of the body, the seat of the affections; cf. Delitzsch's Biblical Psychology (Clark's translation), p. 314ff. "My heart has turned within me" is an expression used in <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a> to designate the feeling of compassion; but here it indicates the most severe internal pain, which becomes thus agonizing through the consciousness of its being deserved on account of resistance to God. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; ekil, <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>, etc. Both forms occur together in other verbs also; cf. Olshausen, Gram. 245, h [Ewald, 238, e; Gesen., 75, Rem. 2]. But the judgment also is fearful; for "without (&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, foris, i.e., in the streets and the open country) the sword renders childless," through the slaughter of the troops; "within (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, in the houses) &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, like death." It is difficult to account for the use of &#1499;&#1468;; for neither the &#1499; of comparison nor the so-called &#1499;veritatis affords a suitable meaning; and the transposition of the words into sicut mors intus (Rosenm&#1516;ller, after L&#1510;we and Wolfsohn) is an arbitrary change. Death, mentioned in connection with the sword, does not mean death in general, but special forms of death through maladies and plagues, as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>, not merely the fever of hunger, <a href="/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a>; on the other hand, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>, "the sword without, pestilence and hunger within." But the difficulty connected with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is not thereby removed. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; belongs to both clauses; but "the sword" cannot also be the subject of the second clause, of which the nominative must be &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, "all that is like death," i.e., everything besides the sword that kills, all other causes of death, - pestilences, famine, etc. &#1499;&#1468; is used as in &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. That this is the meaning is shown by a comparison of the present passage with <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>, which must have been before the writer's mind, so that he took the words of the first clause, viz., "without, the sword bereaves," almost as they stood, but changed &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  into &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, - thus preferring "what is like death," instead of "terror," to describe the cause of destruction. Calvin long ago hit the sense in his paraphrase multae mortes, and the accompanying explanation: utitur nota similitudinis, quasi diceret: nihil domi occurrere nisi mortale (more correctly mortiferum). Much light is thrown on the expression by the parallel adduced by Kalkschmidt from Aeneid, ii. 368, 369: crudelis ubique Luctus, ubique pavor, et plurima mortis imago.<p>From speaking of friends, a transition is made in <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> to enemies. Regarding the explanation of Rosenmller, audiverunt quidem amici mei, a me implorati <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>, quod gemens ego...imo sunt omnes hostes mei, Thenius observes that it introduces too much. This remark is still more applicable to his own interpretation: "People (certainly) hear how I sigh, (yet) I have no comforter." The antithesis introduced by the insertion of "yet" destroys the simplicity of arrangement among the clauses, although C. B. Michaelis and Gerlach also explain the passage in the same manner. The subject of the words, "they have heard," in the first clause, is not the friends who are said in <a href="/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a> to have been called upon for help, nor those designated in the second clause of <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> as "all mine enemies," but persons unnamed, who are only characterized in the second clause as enemies, because they rejoice over the calamity which they have heard of as having befallen Jerusalem. The first clause forms the medium of transition from the faithless friends (<a href="/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>) to the open enemies (<a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>); hence the subject is left undefined, so that one may think of friends and enemies. The foes rejoice that God has brought the evil on her. The words '&#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, which follow, cannot also be dependent on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; ("that Thou hast brought the day which Thou hast announced"), inasmuch as the last clause, "and they shall be like me," does not harmonize with them. Indeed, Ngelsbach and Gerlach, who assume that this is the connection of the clause "Thou hast brought," etc., take '&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499; adversatively: "but they shall be like me." If, however, "they shall be," etc., were intended to form an antithesis to "all mine enemies have heard," etc., the former clause would be introduced by &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;. The mere change of tense is insufficient to prove the point. It must further be borne in mind, that in such a case there would be introduced by the words "and they shall be," etc., a new series of ideas, the second great division of the prayer; but this is opposed by the arrangement of the clauses. The second portion of the prayer cannot be attached to the end of the verse. The new series of thoughts begins rather with "Thou hast brought," which the Syriac has rendered by the imperative, venire fac. Similarly Luther translates: "then (therefore) let the day come." C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Pareau, etc., also take the words optatively, referring to the Arabic idiom, according to which a wish is expressed in a vivid manner by the perfect. This optative use of the perfect certainly cannot be shown to exist in the Hebrew; but perhaps it may be employed to mark what is viewed as certain to follow, in which case the Germans use the present. The use of the perfect shows that the occurrence expected is regarded as so certain to happen, that it is represented as if it had already taken place. The perfects in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56-61</a> are taken in this sense by nearly all expositors. Similarly we take the clause now before us to mean, "Thou bringest on the day which Thou hast proclaimed (announced)," i.e., the day of judgment on the nations, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>, "so that they become like me," i.e., so that the foes who rejoice over my misfortune suffer the same fate as myself. "The day [which] Thou hast proclaimed" has been to specifically rendered in the Vulgate, adduxisti diem consolationis, probably with a reference of the proclamation to <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>. - After this expression of certainty regarding the coming of a day of punishment for her enemies, there follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-22.htm">Lamentations 1:22</a>, the request that all the evil they have done to Jerusalem may come before the face of God, in order that He may punish it (cf. <a href="/psalms/109-15.htm">Psalm 109:15</a> with <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>), - do to them as He has done to Jerusalem, because of her transgressions. The clause which assigns the reason ("for many are my sighs," etc.) does not refer to that which immediately precedes; for neither the request that retribution should be taken, nor the confession of guilt ("for all my transgressions"), can be accounted fore by pointing to the deep misery of Jerusalem, inasmuch as her sighing and sickness are not brought on her by her enemies, but are the result of the sufferings ordained by God regarding her. The words contain the ground of the request that God would look on the misery (<a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>), and show to the wretched one the compassion which men refuse her. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;  is exactly the same expression as that in <a href="/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>; cf. also <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>. The reason thus given for making the entreaty forms an abrupt termination, and with these words the sound of lamentation dies away. </body></html>
