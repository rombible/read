Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Literally, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#774;dona&#772;y has become "as an enemy." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. an enemy&#8212;(Jer 30:14).<p>mourning and lamentation&#8212;There is a play of similar sounds in the original, "sorrow and sadness," to heighten the effect (Job 30:3, Hebrew; Eze 35:3, Margin).<p>Vau.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm" title="The LORD has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied: he has thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has brought them down to the ground: he has polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.">Lamentations 2:2</a></span>. Several pathetical expressions signifying the same things, properly imitating the dialect of mourners, whose passion suffers them not to speak according to art, but frequently they say the same things over and over. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord was as an enemy,.... Who formerly was on their side, their God and guardian, their protector and deliverer, but now against them; and a terrible thing it is to have God for an enemy, or even to be as one; this is repeated, as being exceeding distressing, and even intolerable. Mr. Broughton renders it, "the Lord is become a very enemy"; taking "caph" for a note of reality, and not of similitude; <p>he hath swallowed up Israel; the ten tribes, or the Jewish nation in general; as a lion, or any other savage beast, swallows its prey, and makes nothing of it, and leaves none behind: <p>he hath swallowed up all her palaces: the palaces of Zion or Jerusalem; the palaces of the king, princes, nobles, and great men; as an earthquake or inundation swallows up whole streets and cities at once; See Gill on <a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>; <p>he hath destroyed his strong holds: the fortified places of the land of Israel, the towers and castles: <p>and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation; exceeding great lamentation, for the destruction of its cities, towns, villages, and the inhabitants of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">her palaces … his strong holds</span>] In “her” Jeremiah was thinking of the city, in “his” of the people at large; hence the change in the gender of the pronouns.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mourning and lamentation</span>] <span class="ital">groaning and moaning</span>, or better (as Cheyne) <span class="ital">moaning and bemoaning</span>.

In the first case the poet is thinking of the city; in the second, of the people of Israel. The rendering "moaning and bemoaning" is designed to reproduce, to some extent, the Hebrew phrase, in which two words, derived from the same root, and almost exactly the same, are placed side by side, to give a more intense expression to the idea. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since neither comfort nor advice is to be found with men, Jerusalem makes her complaint of need to God the Lord. "See, Jahveh, that I am distressed. My bowels glow." &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, the passive enhancing form, from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, is found, besides, only in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, where the clause before us is repeated, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>, where it is used of the countenance, and can only mean to be glowing red; it is scarcely legitimate to derive it from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, Arab. h[mr, to be made red, and must rather be referred to Arab. chmr, to ferment, rise into froth; for even in <a href="/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a> &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; does not mean to be red, but to rise into froth. &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, "bowels," are the nobler portions of the internal organs of the body, the seat of the affections; cf. Delitzsch's Biblical Psychology (Clark's translation), p. 314ff. "My heart has turned within me" is an expression used in <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a> to designate the feeling of compassion; but here it indicates the most severe internal pain, which becomes thus agonizing through the consciousness of its being deserved on account of resistance to God. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; ekil, <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>, etc. Both forms occur together in other verbs also; cf. Olshausen, Gram. 245, h [Ewald, 238, e; Gesen., 75, Rem. 2]. But the judgment also is fearful; for "without (&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, foris, i.e., in the streets and the open country) the sword renders childless," through the slaughter of the troops; "within (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, in the houses) &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, like death." It is difficult to account for the use of &#1499;&#1468;; for neither the &#1499; of comparison nor the so-called &#1499;veritatis affords a suitable meaning; and the transposition of the words into sicut mors intus (Rosenm&#1516;ller, after L&#1510;we and Wolfsohn) is an arbitrary change. Death, mentioned in connection with the sword, does not mean death in general, but special forms of death through maladies and plagues, as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>, not merely the fever of hunger, <a href="/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a>; on the other hand, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>, "the sword without, pestilence and hunger within." But the difficulty connected with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is not thereby removed. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; belongs to both clauses; but "the sword" cannot also be the subject of the second clause, of which the nominative must be &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, "all that is like death," i.e., everything besides the sword that kills, all other causes of death, - pestilences, famine, etc. &#1499;&#1468; is used as in &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. That this is the meaning is shown by a comparison of the present passage with <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>, which must have been before the writer's mind, so that he took the words of the first clause, viz., "without, the sword bereaves," almost as they stood, but changed &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  into &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, - thus preferring "what is like death," instead of "terror," to describe the cause of destruction. Calvin long ago hit the sense in his paraphrase multae mortes, and the accompanying explanation: utitur nota similitudinis, quasi diceret: nihil domi occurrere nisi mortale (more correctly mortiferum). Much light is thrown on the expression by the parallel adduced by Kalkschmidt from Aeneid, ii. 368, 369: crudelis ubique Luctus, ubique pavor, et plurima mortis imago.<p>From speaking of friends, a transition is made in <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> to enemies. Regarding the explanation of Rosenmller, audiverunt quidem amici mei, a me implorati <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>, quod gemens ego...imo sunt omnes hostes mei, Thenius observes that it introduces too much. This remark is still more applicable to his own interpretation: "People (certainly) hear how I sigh, (yet) I have no comforter." The antithesis introduced by the insertion of "yet" destroys the simplicity of arrangement among the clauses, although C. B. Michaelis and Gerlach also explain the passage in the same manner. The subject of the words, "they have heard," in the first clause, is not the friends who are said in <a href="/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a> to have been called upon for help, nor those designated in the second clause of <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> as "all mine enemies," but persons unnamed, who are only characterized in the second clause as enemies, because they rejoice over the calamity which they have heard of as having befallen Jerusalem. The first clause forms the medium of transition from the faithless friends (<a href="/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>) to the open enemies (<a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>); hence the subject is left undefined, so that one may think of friends and enemies. The foes rejoice that God has brought the evil on her. The words '&#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, which follow, cannot also be dependent on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; ("that Thou hast brought the day which Thou hast announced"), inasmuch as the last clause, "and they shall be like me," does not harmonize with them. Indeed, Ngelsbach and Gerlach, who assume that this is the connection of the clause "Thou hast brought," etc., take '&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499; adversatively: "but they shall be like me." If, however, "they shall be," etc., were intended to form an antithesis to "all mine enemies have heard," etc., the former clause would be introduced by &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;. The mere change of tense is insufficient to prove the point. It must further be borne in mind, that in such a case there would be introduced by the words "and they shall be," etc., a new series of ideas, the second great division of the prayer; but this is opposed by the arrangement of the clauses. The second portion of the prayer cannot be attached to the end of the verse. The new series of thoughts begins rather with "Thou hast brought," which the Syriac has rendered by the imperative, venire fac. Similarly Luther translates: "then (therefore) let the day come." C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Pareau, etc., also take the words optatively, referring to the Arabic idiom, according to which a wish is expressed in a vivid manner by the perfect. This optative use of the perfect certainly cannot be shown to exist in the Hebrew; but perhaps it may be employed to mark what is viewed as certain to follow, in which case the Germans use the present. The use of the perfect shows that the occurrence expected is regarded as so certain to happen, that it is represented as if it had already taken place. The perfects in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56-61</a> are taken in this sense by nearly all expositors. Similarly we take the clause now before us to mean, "Thou bringest on the day which Thou hast proclaimed (announced)," i.e., the day of judgment on the nations, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>, "so that they become like me," i.e., so that the foes who rejoice over my misfortune suffer the same fate as myself. "The day [which] Thou hast proclaimed" has been to specifically rendered in the Vulgate, adduxisti diem consolationis, probably with a reference of the proclamation to <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>. - After this expression of certainty regarding the coming of a day of punishment for her enemies, there follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-22.htm">Lamentations 1:22</a>, the request that all the evil they have done to Jerusalem may come before the face of God, in order that He may punish it (cf. <a href="/psalms/109-15.htm">Psalm 109:15</a> with <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>), - do to them as He has done to Jerusalem, because of her transgressions. The clause which assigns the reason ("for many are my sighs," etc.) does not refer to that which immediately precedes; for neither the request that retribution should be taken, nor the confession of guilt ("for all my transgressions"), can be accounted fore by pointing to the deep misery of Jerusalem, inasmuch as her sighing and sickness are not brought on her by her enemies, but are the result of the sufferings ordained by God regarding her. The words contain the ground of the request that God would look on the misery (<a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>), and show to the wretched one the compassion which men refuse her. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;  is exactly the same expression as that in <a href="/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>; cf. also <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>. The reason thus given for making the entreaty forms an abrupt termination, and with these words the sound of lamentation dies away. </body></html>
