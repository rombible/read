Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Habitations - The dwellings of the shepherds in the pastures <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>.

As he regarded not his own habitation the temple, nor the ark his footstool, it is no wonder he should be unconcerned about the habitations of others; as of the inhabitants of the land of Judea and of Jerusalem, particularly of the king, his nobles, and the great men; these the Lord swallowed up, or suffered to be swallowed up, as houses in an earthquake, and by an inundation, so as to be seen no more; and this he did without showing the least reluctance, pity, and compassion; being so highly incensed and provoked by their sins and transgressions: <p>he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; not only the dwelling houses of the people, but the most fortified places, their castles, towers, and citadels: <p>he hath brought them down to the ground; and not only battered and shook them, but beat them down, and laid them level with the ground; and all this done in the fury of his wrath, being irritated to it by the sins of his people; even the daughter of Judah, or the congregation thereof, as the Targum: <p>he hath polluted the kingdom, and the princes thereof; what was reckoned sacred, the kingdom of the house of David, and the kings and princes of it, the Lord's anointed; these being defiled with sin, God cast them away, as filth to the dunghill, and gave them up into the hands of the Gentiles, who were reckoned unclean; and thus they were profaned.

By this contemplative digression he breaks in on the lamentation of the city, as if the voice of the weeping one were choked with tears, thus he introduces into the complaint a suitable pause, that both serves to divide the lamentation into two, and also brings a turn in its contents. It is in vain that Zion stretches out her hands (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;, to make a spreading out with the hands) for comforters and helpers; there is none she can embrace, for Jahveh has given orders against Jacob, that those round about him should act as oppressors. &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; are the neighbouring nations round about Israel. These are all of hostile disposition, and strive but to increase his misery; cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a>. Jerusalem has become their abomination (cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>), since God, in punishment for sins, has exposed her before the heathen nations (cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, "between them," the neighbouring nations, who live round about Judah. The thought that Jahveh has decreed the suffering which has come on Jerusalem, is laid to heart by her who makes complaint, so that, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a>, she owns God's justice, and lets herself be roused to ask for pity, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19-22</a>.<p>Starting with the acknowledgment that Jahveh is righteous, because Jerusalem has opposed His word, the sorrowing one anew (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a>, as in <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>) calls on the nations to regard her sorrow, which attains its climax when her children, in the bloom of youth, are taken captives by the enemy. But she finds no commiseration among men; for some, her former friends, prove faithless, and her counsellors have perished (<a href="/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>); therefore she turns to God, making complaint to Him of her great misery (<a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>), because the rest, her enemies, even rejoice over her misery (<a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>): she prays that God may punish these. Gerlach has properly remarked, that this conclusion of the chapter shows Jerusalem does not set forth her fate as an example for the warning of the nations, nor desires thereby to obtain commiseration from them in her present state (Michaelis, Rosenmller, Thenius, Vaihinger); but that the apostrophe addressed to the nations, as well as that to passers-by (<a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>), is nothing more than a poetic turn, used to express the boundless magnitude of this her sorrow and her suffering. On the confession "Righteous is Jahveh," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-6.htm">2 Chronicles 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>, etc. "Because I have rebelled against His mouth" (i.e., His words and commandments), therefore I am suffering what I have merited.

In order to indicate the greatness of her grief, the sorrowing one mentions the carrying into captivity of the young men and virgins, who are a mother's joy and hope.</body></html>
