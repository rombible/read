Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done.

Thou hast made me as a great mother to bring Up many inhabitants that were my children, and now the enemy hath consumed the far greater number of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast called, as in a solemn day, my terrors round about,.... Terrible enemies, as the Chaldeans; these came at the call of God, as soldiers at the command of their general; and in as great numbers as men from all parts of Judea flocked to Jerusalem on any of the three solemn feasts of passover, pentecost, and tabernacles. The Targum paraphrases it very foreign to the sense; <p>"thou shall proclaim liberty to thy people, the house of Israel, by the Messiah, as thou didst by Moses and Aaron on the day of the passover:'' <p>so that in the day of the Lord's anger none escaped or remained; in the city of Jerusalem, and in the land of Judea; either they were put to death, or were carried captive; so that there was scarce an inhabitant to be found, especially after Gedaliah was slain, and the Jews left in the land were carried into Egypt: <p>those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed; or "whom I could span", as Broughton; or "handled"; whose limbs she had stroked with her hands, whom she had swathed with bands, and had carried in her arms, and had most carefully and tenderly brought up: by those she had "swaddled" are meant the little ones; and by those she had "brought up" the greater ones, as Aben Ezra observes; but both the enemy, the Chaldeans, consumed and destroyed without mercy, without regard to their tender years, or the manner in which they were brought up; but as if they were nourished like lambs for the day of slaughter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>22. <span class="ital">Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side</span>] i.e. Jehovah has summoned for my destruction the sword, famine, and pestilence.

The LXX (and similarly Targ.) render instead of “terrors” (from a similar Heb. root) <span class="ital">neighbouring villages</span> (so Löhr), which, if this be the sense, are spoken of as sharing in Jerusalem’s calamities. The former view, however, is preferable, both as harmonizing better with the thought expressed in the last line, and as having probable reference to Jeremiah’s favourite expression (see on <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm" title="Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.">Jeremiah 6:25</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast called as in a solemn day.</span> The passage is illustrated by <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>, according to which the instruments of Jehovah's vengeance are "summoned" by him to a festival when starting for the holy war. <span class="cmt_word">My terrors round about.</span> Almost identical with one of the characteristic phrases of Jeremiah's prophecies, "fear [or rather, 'terror'] on every side" (see on Jeremiah 6:25). <span class="cmt_word">Have swaddled;</span> rather, have borne <span class="accented">upon the hands</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The enemy in triumph express their joy over the fall of Jerusalem.

The gnashing of the teeth (<a href="/psalms/35-16.htm">Psalm 35:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>; <a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>) is here an expression of rage that has burst out. The object of "we have swallowed" is to be derived from the context ("against thee"), viz., the city of Jerusalem. Surely this" is a strong asseveration - "this is the very day." The asyndetic collection of the three verbs accords with the impassioned character of the enemy's speech. "To see" is here equivalent to living to see.</body></html>
