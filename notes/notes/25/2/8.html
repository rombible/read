Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them.

According to its etymology, &#1504;&#1493;&#1492; means a place where shepherds or nomads rest, or stay, or live; here, it is not to be understood specially of the dwellings as contrasted with, or distinguished from the pasture-grounds, but denotes, in contrast with the fortresses (&#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), the open, unfortified places of the country in which men and cattle enjoy food and rest. "The strongholds of the daughter of Judah" are not merely the fortifications of Jerusalem, but the fortresses generally of the country and kingdom of Judah; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-17.htm">Jeremiah 5:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, "to cast down to the ground" (used of the pulling down of walls, cf. <a href="/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>), is an epexegesis of &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>, and is not to be joined (in opposition to the accents) with what succeeds, and taken figuratively.
