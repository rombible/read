Let him pray; and let him in prayer pour out his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better as in the margin cometh to us for price.

Gerlach has correctly given the sense of these verses thus: "They still cling to their hopes, and are nevertheless completely in the power of the enemy, from whom they cannot escape. All their movements are closely watched; it is impossible for any one to deceive himself any longer: it is all over with the nation, now that all attempts at flight have failed (<a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>), and that the king, 'the life's breath' of the nation, has fallen into the hands of the enemy." Gerlach and Ngelsbach have already very properly set aside the strange and fanciful idea of Ewald, that in <a href="/lamentations/4-18.htm">Lamentations 4:18</a> it is still Egypt that is regarded, and that the subject treated of is, - how Egypt, merely through fear of the Chaldeans, had at that time publicly forbidden the fugitives to go to Palestine for purposes of grace and traffic. These same writers have also refuted the arbitrary interpretation put upon '&#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; by Thenius and Vaihinger, who imagine there is a reference to towers used in a siege, from which the besiegers could not merely perceive all that was going on within the city, but also shoot at persons who showed themselves in exposed places. In reply to this, Ngelsbach appropriately remarks that we must not judge of the siege-material of the ancients by the range of cannon. Moreover, &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; does not mean to spy out, but to search out, pursue; and the figure is taken from the chase. The idea is simply this: The enemy (the Chaldeans) watch us in our every step, so that we can no longer move freely about. Our end is near, yea, it is already come; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-2.htm">Ezekiel 7:2-6</a>. A proof of this is given in the capture of King Zedekiah, after he had fled in the night, <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>. For an elucidation of the matters contained in these verses, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>. The comparison of the enemy to eagles is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, whence Jeremiah has already derived <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> and <a href="/lamentations/48-40.htm">Lamentations 48:40</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511;, prop. to burn, metaph. to pursue hotly, is here (poet.) construed with acc., but elsewhere with &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;; cf. <a href="/genesis/31-36.htm">Genesis 31:36</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-53.htm">1 Samuel 17:53</a>. "On the hills and in the wilderness," i.e., on every side, even in inaccessible places. "In the wilderness" alludes to the capture of Zedekiah; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>. "The breath of our nostrils" is an expression founded on <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, and signifying "our life's breath." Such is the designation given to the king, - not Zedekiah in special, whose capture is here spoken of, because he ex initio magnam de se spem concitaverat, fore ut post tristia Jojakimi et Jechoniae fata pacatior res publica esset (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Vaihinger), but the theocratic king, as the anointed of the Lord, and as the one who was the bearer of God's promise, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. In elucidation of the figurative expression, Pareau has appropriately reminded is of Seneca's words (Clement. i.:4): ille (princeps) est spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt. "What the breath is, in relation to the life and stability of the body, such is the king in relation to the life and stability of the nation" (Gerlach). "Of whom we said (thought), Under his shadow (i.e., protection and covering) we shall live among the nations." It is not implied in these words, as Ngelsbach thinks, that "they hoped to fall in with a friendly heathen nation, and there, clustering around their king, as their protector and the pledge of a better future, spend their days in freedom, if no more," but merely that, under the protection of their king, they hoped to live even among the heathen, i.e., to be able to continue their existence, and to prosper as a nation. For, so long as there remained to them the king whom God had given, together with the promises attached to the kingdom, they might cherish the hope that the Lord would still fulfil to them these promises also. But this hope seemed to be destroyed when the king was taken prisoner, deprived of sight, and carried away to Babylon into captivity. The words "taken in their pits" are figurative, and derived from the capture of wild animals. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; as in <a href="/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>. On the figure of the shadow, cf. <a href="/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-17.htm">Ezekiel 31:17</a>.</body></html>
