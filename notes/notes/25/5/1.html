It would seem as if Jeremiah first wrote freely what was in his mind, and then set to work as an artist to bring it under the alphabetic scheme.

All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence.

This chapter is called, in some Greek copies, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, "the prayer of Jeremiah". Cocceius interprets the whole of the state of the Christian church after the last destruction of Jerusalem; and of what happened to the disciples of Christ in the first times of the Gospel; and of what Christians have endured under antichrist down to the present times: but it is best to understand it of the Jews in Babylon; representing their sorrowful case, as represented by the prophet; entreating that the Lord would remember the affliction they were under, and deliver them out of it, that which he had determined should come upon them. So the Targum, <p>"remember, O Lord, what was decreed should be unto us;'' <p>and what he had long threatened should come upon them; and which they had reason to fear would come, though they put away the evil day far from them; but now it was come, and it lay heavy upon them; and therefore they desire it might be taken off: <p>consider, and behold our reproach: cast upon them by their enemies; and the rather the Lord is entreated to look upon and consider that, since his name was concerned in it, and it was for his sake, and because of the true religion they professed; also the disgrace they were in, being carried into a foreign country for their sins; and so were in contempt by all the nations around. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> consider, and behold our reproach.</span><p>(a) This prayer as is thought, was made when some of the people were carried away captive, others such as the poorest remained, and some went into Egypt and other places for comfort, though it seems that the prophet foreseeing their miseries to come, thus prayed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

In this way, <a href="/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17</a> is attached to what precedes, - not merely to <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>, but also the series of thoughts developed in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12-16</a>, viz., that in the capture of Jerusalem (which nobody thought possible) there is plainly made known the judgment of God upon the sins of His people and their leaders. It is with special emphasis that &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; stands at the beginning of the verse: "still do our eyes continue to waste away." The form &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (Kethib), in place of which the Qeri subtitles &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is abnormal, since &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; does not take plural forms of the suffix in any other instance, and &#1470;&#1504;&#1492; does not occur elsewhere as a noun-suffix. The form is evidently copied from &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, and must be third fem. pl., as distinguished from the singular suffix &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/1_kings/1-22.htm">1 Kings 1:22</a>. The Qeri &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which is preferred by Michaelis, Pareau, Rosenmller, and Thenius, has for its basis the idea "we still were;" this is shown by the translation &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; of the lxx, and cum adhuc subsisteremus of Jerome. But this view of the word, like most of the Qeris, is a useless attempt at explanation; for &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; alone cannot have the meaning attributed to it. and the supplements proposed, in statu priori, or "in the city," are but arbitrary insertions into the text. The combination &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, which is a rare one, evidently means, "our eyes are still pining (consuming) away," so that the imperfect is used with the meaning of the participle; cf. Ewald, 306, c, Rem. 2. The combination of &#1499;&#1500;&#1492; with &#1488;&#1500; is pregnant: "they consume away (while looking out) for our help;" cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; is not an exclamation, "in vain!" (Thenius), but stands in apposition to "our help;" thus, "for our help, a help of vanity," i.e., for a vain help; cf. Ewald, 287, c. The vain help is more distinctly specified in the second member of the verse, as a looking out for a nation that will not help. &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; does not mean "the watch-tower" (Chald., Syr., etc.), - because "on the watch-tower" would require to be expressed by &#1506;&#1500;; cf. <a href="/isaiah/21-8.htm">Isaiah 21:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-24.htm">2 Chronicles 20:24</a>, - but "watching." By the "nation that does not help," expositors, following <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>, think that Egypt is intended. But the words must by no means be referred to the event there described, inasmuch as we should then be obliged to take the verbs as preterites-a course which would not accord with the interchange of the imperfect (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;) with the perfect (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;). A strange confusion would also arise, such as is made out by Vaihinger: for we would find the prophet placing his readers, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, in the time of the siege of Jerusalem; then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-15.htm">Lamentations 4:15</a>, into the conquered city; and in <a href="/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-18.htm">Lamentations 4:18</a>, back once more into the beleaguered city, which we again, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>, see conquered (Gerlach). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-18.htm">Lamentations 4:18-20</a>, Judah is completely in the power of the Chaldeans; hence the subject treated of in <a href="/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17</a> is the looking out for the assistance of some nation, after the enemy had already taken Jerusalem and laid it in ashes. What the prophet denounces, then, is that help is still looked for from a nation which nevertheless will not help. In this, perhaps, he may have had Egypt before his mind; for, that the Jews, even after the destruction of Jerusalem, still looked for deliverance or help from Egypt, may be inferred partly from the fact that those who were left in the country fled thither for refuge, and partly from <a href="/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>. Only, the words are not to be restricted merely to this.</body></html>
