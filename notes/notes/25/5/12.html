Let him pray; and let him in prayer pour out his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Laid the yoke - The yoke in the Bible is an emblem of slavery or bondage <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>; of afflictions and crosses <a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>; of punishment for sin <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>; of God's commandments <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>.

According to some, as Aben Ezra observes, by the hand of the servants before mentioned; however, by the hand of the Chaldeans or Babylonians; see <a href="/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a>. Some understand it of their own hands, as if they laid violent hands upon themselves, not being able to bear the hardships and disgrace they were subjected to but I should rather think this is to be understood of hanging them, not by the neck, but by the hand, could any instance be given of such a kind of punishment so early used, and by this people; which has been in other nations, and in more modern times: <p>the faces of elders were not honoured; no reverence or respect were shown to elders in age or office, or on account of either; but were treated with rudeness and contempt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Princes were hung up by <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</span><p>(f) That is, by the enemies hand.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. The reference may either be to impalement after death, or to torture in order, as Pe. suggests, to obtain information as to hidden treasure. Both death by crucifixion and subsequent impalement were regarded with the utmost abhorrence by the Jews. For the former see <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Princes are hanged up by their hand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the hand of the enemy. Impalement after death was a common punishment with the Assyrians and Babylonians. Thus Sennacherib says that, after capturing rebellious Ekron, he hung the bodies of the chief men on stakes all round the city ('Records of the Past,' 1:38). Benomi gives a picture of such an impalement from one of the plates in Botta's great work ('Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 192). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; is more exactly defined by the superadded &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, which belongs to both members of the verse. "In order to satisfy ourselves with bread (so as to prolong our lives), we give the hand to Egypt, to Assyria." &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; are local accusatives. To give the hand is a sign of submission or subjection; see on <a href="/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>. Pareau has correctly given the meaning thus: si victum nobis comparare velimus, vel Judaea nobis relinquenda est atque Aegyptii sunt agnoscendi domini, vel si hic manemus, Chaldaeis victoribus nos subjiciamus necesse est; quocunque nos vertamus, nihil superest nisi tristissima servitus. This complaint shows, moreover, that it is those in Judea who are speaking. &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "we give the hand," shows that the assumption of Thenius, - that the writer here brings to remembrance the fate of two other companies of his fellow-countrymen who were not carried away into exile, - -is an arbitrary insertion. Asshur, as the name of the great Asiatic empire, stands for Babylon, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>.</body></html>
