Let him pray; and let him in prayer pour out his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Servants - i. e.

Servants &#8230; ruled &#8230; us&#8212;Servants under the Chaldean governors ruled the Jews (Ne 5:15). Israel, once a "kingdom of priests" (Ex 19:6), is become like Canaan, "a servant of servants," according to the curse (Ge 9:25). The Chaldeans were designed to be "servants" of Shem, being descended from Ham (Ge 9:26).

Cp.

Budde suggests that such persons may have seized upon property (cp. <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6</a>) and forced the Jews to earn their bread under them as day-labourers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Servants have ruled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">slaves.</span> The Babylonians in general might be called slaves, by comparison with the "kingdom of priests" (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), and the "sons" of Jehovah (<a href="/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>).

The quest made in <a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a> refers to the oppression depicted in what follows. The words, "Remember, O Lord, what hath happened (i.e., befallen) us," are more fully explained in the second member, "Look and behold our disgrace." It is quite arbitrary in Thenius to refer the first member to the past, the second to the present, described in what follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12-16</a>. The Qeri &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; is an unnecessary alteration, after <a href="/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>. - With <a href="/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2</a> begins the description of the disgrace that has befallen them. This consists, first of all, in the fact that their inheritance has become the possession of strangers. Rosenm&#1516;ller rightly explains &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; to mean, terra quae tuo nobis dono quandam est concessa. &#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1498; is used of the transference of the property to others, as in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>. Many expositors would refer &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; to the houses in Jerusalem which the Chaldeans had not destroyed, on the ground that it is stated, in <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>, that the Chaldeans destroyed none but large houses. There is no foundation, however, for this restriction; moreover, it is opposed by the parallel &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. Just as by &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; we are to understand, not merely the possession of Jerusalem, but of the whole country, so also &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; are the dwelling-houses of the country in towns and villages; in this case, the question whether any houses still remained standing in Jerusalem does not demand consideration at all. Ngelsbach is wrong in his remark that &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; respectively mean immovable and portable property, for houses are certainly not moveable property.</body></html>
