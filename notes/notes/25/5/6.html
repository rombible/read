If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"To give the hand" means to submit oneself. Absolutely it was Babylon that had just destroyed their national existence, but Jeremiah means that all feelings of patriotism were crushed, and the sole care that remained was the desire for personal preservation.

Let the enemy triumph; the guilt of the daughter of Zion will come to an end, and then the guilt of the daughter of Edom will be punished. With this "Messianic hope," as Ewald rightly characterizes the contents of these verses, the lamentation resolves itself into joyous faith and hope regarding the future of Israel. There is no external sign to mark the transition from the depths of lamentation over the hopeless condition of Judah, to new and hopeful confidence, just as in the Psalms there is frequently a sudden change from the deepest lamentation to joyful confidence of final victory. But these transitions have their origin in the firm conviction that Israel has most assuredly been chosen as the nation with whom the Lord has made His covenant, which He cannot break. This truth has already been clearly and distinctly expressed in the threatenings and promises of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, and is reiterated by all the prophets. The Lord will assuredly visit His ever-rebellious people with the heaviest punishments, until they come to acknowledge their sin and repent of their apostasy; but He will afterwards again take pity on the penitent remnant, gather them from among the heathen, and fulfil all His promises to them. The words "exult and rejoice" are ironical, and signify: "Rejoice as much as you please; you will not, for all that, escape the punishment for your sins." "The daughter of Edom," i.e., the people of Edom, is named as the representative of the enemies of God's people, on account of their implacable hatred against Israel; see on <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>. From the designation, "dwelling in the land of Uz," it does not follow that the Edomite had at that time spread themselves widely over their original territory; for the land of Uz, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>, lay on the confines of Idumea. As to the form &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, "towards thee also (sc., as now to Judah) shall the cup pass." On this figure, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, to make oneself naked, or to become naked in consequence of drunkenness (<a href="/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>), is a figurative expression indicative of the disgrace that will befall Edom; cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;, "Thy guilt is ended." The perfect is prophetic. The guilt is ended when it is atoned for; the punishment for it has reached its end, or grace begins. That this will take place in the Messianic times (as was pointed out long ago in the Chaldee paraphrase, et liberaberis per manum Messiae), is not indeed implied in the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, but it is a necessary product of the Messianic hope of Israel; cf, for instance, <a href="/jeremiah/50-20.htm">Jeremiah 50:20</a>. To this it cannot be objected (with Gerlach), that it is inadmissible to transfer into the Messianic time also the punishment of Edom threatened in the second member: for, according to the prophetic mode of viewing things, the judgment on the heathen world falls, as a matter of course, in the Messianic age; and to refer the words to the chastisement of the Edomites by Nebuchadnezzar is against the context of both verses. "To reveal (discover) sins" means to punish them; for God uncovers the sins in order to punish them, quemadmodum Deus peccata tegere dicitur, cum eorum paenam remittit (Rosenmller); cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a>, etc. </body></html>
