Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither does God approve of wanton cruelty inflicted by one man on another. Three examples are given: the treatment of prisoners of war; the procuring an unjust sentence before a legal tribunal acting in the name of God (see <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>); and the perversion of justice generally. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. subvert&#8212;to wrong.<p>Mem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here are three things mentioned, of all which it is said that God <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">approveth</span> them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">not</span> neither all, nor any of them. The first is, <span class="ital">to crush the prisoners of the earth</span>: he hath power to crush all men in the world, they are his prisoners, and cannot flee from him, but he delighteth not in it. Some think it spoken with special reference to the Jews, who now were all captives. A second thing which it is said God approveth not is, <span class="ital">turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High</span>. Some by <span class="ital">the Most High</span> understand God, and make the sense to be, <span class="ital">in the sight of God</span>. Others think that a superior magistrate is understood, who, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm" title="If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a></span>, is called the <span class="ital">highest</span>; and that seemeth the most probable sense. The turning away the right of a man before them, signifieth the use of any arts to deprive them of their just right by misrepresenting their cause, aspersing their persons, &c. The third thing mentioned is, the <span class="ital">subverting</span> a man in his cause, either by art and rhetoric, making it to appear bad when it is not so, or by mere will and power, overruling it contrary to right and justice. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To subvert a man in his cause,.... A poor man, as the Targum, which aggravates it; as by courses and methods taken in an open court, so by secret underhand ways, to get the cause from him, and injure him in his property: <p>the Lord approveth not; or, "seeth not" (g); which some understand as spoken by wicked men, who do the above things, and flatter themselves that God sees not, and takes no notice of them, <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>; and others read it interrogatively, "doth not the Lord see?" (h) he does; he sees all the actions of men, nothing is hid from him; but he sees not with approbation; he do not look upon such things with delight and pleasure, but with abhorrence, <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>. The Targum is, <p>"is it possible that it should not be revealed before the Lord?'' <p>(g)  "non vidit, vel videt", Pagninus, Montanus, Calvin. (h) "Non videret?"

The sense is an excellent one, but it is very doubtful whether it can be obtained without altering one of the letters of the word in the text (reading <span class="accented">racah</span> for <span class="accented">ra'ah</span>). The text reading is, "the Lord seeth not." This may be explained either as "the Lord regardeth not (such thing)," or as a question, "Doth not the Lord regard (this)?" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Let him also learn patiently to bear abuse and reviling from men. Let him present his cheek to him who smites him, as was done by Job (<a href="/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>) and the servant of Jahveh (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>); cf. <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>. On <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3</a>, etc. There is a certain gradation in the three verses that it quite unmistakeable. The sitting alone and in silence is comparatively the easiest; it is harder to place the mouth in the dust, and yet cling to hope; it is most difficult of all to give the cheek to the smiter, and to satiate oneself with dishonour (Ngelsbach). In <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a> follow the grounds of comfort. The first is in <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a> : the sorrow will come to an end; the Lord does not cast off for ever; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. The second is in <a href="/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a> : when He has caused sorrow, He shows pity once more, according to the fulness of His grace. Compassion outweighs sorrow. On this subject, cf. <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>. The third ground of comfort is in <a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a> : God does not send affliction willingly, as if it brought Him joy (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>), but merely because chastisement is necessary to sinful man for the increase of his spiritual prosperity; cf. <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;: cf. Ewald, 232, f; Gesenius, 69, 3, Rem. 6.<p>That he may bring home to the hearts of God's people the exhortation to bear suffering with patience and resignation, and that he may lead them to see that the weight of sorrow under which they are sighing has been sent from the Lord as a chastisement for their sins, the prophet carries out the thought, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-39</a>, that every wrong committed upon earth is under the divine control (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-36</a>), and generally that nothing happens without God's permission; hence man ought not to mourn over the suffering that befalls him, but rather over his sins (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-39</a>).</body></html>
