Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Translate:<p>Let him sit alone and keep silence;<p>For He (God) hath laid the yoke upon him.<p>Let him place his mouth in the dust;<p>Perchance there is hope.<p>Let him offer his cheek to him that smiteth him;<p>Let him be filled to the full with reproach.<p>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, but only if he bear it rightly.

Some render the words in connection with the preceding, it is good "that he sit alone" (b); it is good for a man to be alone; in his closet, praying to God; in his house or chamber, reading the word of God; in the field, or elsewhere, meditating upon it, and upon the works of God, of nature, providence, and grace: <p>and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it on him: or, "took it on him"; either because he took it upon him willingly, and therefore should bear it patiently; or because he (God) hath put it upon him (c), and therefore should be silent, and not murmur and repine, since he hath done it, <a href="/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>. <p>(b)  "ut sedeat solus", Gataker.

Following in the wake of Luther ("Thou wilt assuredly think thereon"), C. B. Michaelis, Pareau, Rosenmller, and Kalkschmidt take it as second pers.: "Think, yea, think wilt Thou, that my soul is bowed down in me," or "that my soul is at rest within me" (Ngelsbach). But it is impossible to maintain either of these views in the face of the language employed. To take the &#1493; before &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; in the meaning of quod is characterized by Ngelsbach as an arbitrary procedure, unwarranted either by <a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a> or <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; but neither can the meaning of resting, being at east, which is attributed to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; by that writer, be established. The verb means to sink down, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>, and metaphorically, to be bowed down, <a href="/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>. The latter meaning is required in the present passage, from the simple fact that the sentence undeniably refers to <a href="/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>.<p>(Note: Luther's translation, "for my soul tells me," is founded on the circumstance that the lxx have mistaken &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; for &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;.)<p>&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; expresses the consequence of &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, which therefore can only be the third pers., and "my soul" the subject of both clauses; for there is no logical consecution of the meaning given by such a rendering as, "If Thou wilt remember, my soul shall be bowed within me." The expression, "If my soul duly meditates thereon (on the deep suffering), it becomes depressed within me," forms the foundation of the request that God would think of his distress, his misery; and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>, "I will lay this to heart," connects itself with the leading thought set forth in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>, the reason for which is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-20.htm">Lamentations 3:20</a>, viz., that my soul is only bowed down within me over the thought of my distress, and must complain of it to God, that He may think of it and alleviate it: This will I lay to heart and set my hope upon. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is a strong inferential expression: "therefore," because God alone can help, will I hope. This self-encouragement begins with <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>, inasmuch as the prophet strengthens his hope by a consideration of the infinite compassion of the Lord. (It is) &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;, "the mercies of God," i.e., proofs of His mercy (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-43.htm">Psalm 107:43</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), "that we are not utterly consumed," as Luther and similarly our English translators have excellently rendered &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. This form stands for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :28, not for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, third pers., as Pareau, Thenius, Vaihinger, and Ewald, referring to his Grammar, 84, b, would take it. The proofs of the grace of God have their foundation in His compassion, from which they flow. In <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a> we take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;  as the subject of &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;; it is the proofs of the grace of God that are new every morning, not "His compassions," although the idea remains the same. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, every morning, as in <a href="/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>. Ubi sol et dies oritur, simul et radii hujus inexhaustae bonitatis erumpunt (Tarnovius in Rosenmller). The consciousness of this constant renewal of the divine favour impels to the prayerful exclamation, "great is Thy faithfulness;" cf. <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>.</body></html>
