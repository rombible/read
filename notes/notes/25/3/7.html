It is a metaphor taken from malefactors that have heavy chains put upon their legs, that they may not make their escape out of prison: or, "my brass" (g); that is, chains, or a chain made of brass; so the Targum, <p>"he hath made heavy upon my feet fetters of brass.'' <p>(g)  Sept.

The author of these sufferings is not, indeed, expressly named in the whole section, but it is unmistakeably signified that God is meant; moreover, at the end of <a href="/lamentations/3-18.htm">Lamentations 3:18</a> the name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is mentioned. The view thus given of the sufferings shows, not merely that he who utters the complaint perceives in these sufferings a chastisement by God, but also that this chastisement has become for him a soul-struggle, in which he may not take the name of God into his mouth; and only after he has given vent in lamentations to the deep sorrow of his soul, does his spirit get peace to mention the name of the Lord, and make complaint to Him of his need. Nothing certain can be inferred from the lamentations themselves regarding the person who makes complaint. It does not follow from <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-1.htm">Lamentations 3:1-3</a> that he was burdened with sorrows more than every one else; nor from <a href="/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a> that he was a personage well known to all the people, so that one could recognise the prophet in him. As little are they sufferings which Jeremiah has endured alone, and for his own sake, but sufferings such as many godly people of his time have undergone and struggled through. Against the Jeremianic authorship of the poem, therefore, no argument can be drawn from the fact that the personality of him who utters the complaint is concealed.<p><a href="/lamentations/3-1.htm">Lamentations 3:1</a><p>In the complaint, "I am the man that saw (i.e., lived to see) misery," the misery is not specified; and we cannot, with Rosenmller, refer &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; (without the article) to the misery announced by the prophet long before. "The rod of His wrath," as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>, is the rod of God's anger; cf. <a href="/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>; <a href="/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, etc. The suffix in &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is not to be referred, with Aben Ezra, to the enemy.</body></html>
