"Pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord," i.e., utter the sorrow of thine heart in tears to the Lord. The uplifting of the hands is a gesture indicative of prayer and entreaty (cf. <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>, etc.), not "of the deepest distress" (Thenius). &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean pro vita parvulorum tuorum, that God may at least preserve them (Rosenmller, Gerlach), but "on account of the soul of thy children," which is more distinctly stated, in the following relative sentence, to mean that they have breathed out their soul through hunger. On this matter, cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a> and the exposition of that verse. Ewald has placed the last member of the verse within parentheses, as an interpolation, on the ground that a fourth member offends against the law observed in these verses; on the other hand, Thenius is of opinion that the words do not form a member of the verse by themselves, but are a mere prolongation of the third, "because the conclusion of the prophet's address, begun in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>, was certainly intended to be a complete finish." But the deviation from the rule is not thereby accounted for. Inasmuch as the words are essential to the expression of the thought, we must simply acknowledge the irregularity, and not arbitrarily cast suspicion on the genuineness of the words.</body></html>
