Though during the siege they were far from peace in a strict sense, yet in their captivity they had that peace; but both their minds were far off from quiet, and their persons from prosperity: the prophet owneth God as the cause of this.

From the time the city was besieged by the Chaldeans, and now the people was carried captive; who could have no true peace, being in a foreign land, in an enemy's country, and out of their own, and far from the place of divine worship; nor could the prophet have any peace of soul, in the consideration of these things, the city, temple, and nation, being desolate, though he himself was not in captivity. <p>I forgat prosperity; or "good" (q); he had been so long from the enjoyment of it, that he had lost the idea of it, and was thoughtless about it, never expecting to see it any more. <p>(q) "bonorum", V.

On the figure of a bear lying in wait, cf. <a href="/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>; <a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>. It is more usual to find enemies compared to lions in ambush; cf. <a href="/psalms/10-19.htm">Psalm 10:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>. The last-named passage seems to have been present to the writer's mind. The prophets frequently compare enemies to lions, e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>. - In <a href="/lamentations/3-11.htm">Lamentations 3:11</a> the figure of the lion is discontinued; for cowreer &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; cannot be said of a beast. The verb here is not to be derived from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;, to be refractory, but is the Pilel of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to go aside, deviate, make to draw back. To "make ways turn aside" may signify to make a person lose the right road, but not to drag back from the road (Thenius); it rather means to mislead, or even facere ut deficiant viae, to take away the road, so that one cannot escape. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in Hebrew; in Aramean it means to cut or tear in pieces: cf. [the Targum on] <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>, "Samuel  &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495; Agag," hewed him in pieces; and on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>, where the word is used for the Heb. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, to tear in pieces (of a lion); here it signifies to tear away (limbs from the body, boughs from trees). This meaning is required by the context; for the following expression, &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, does not lead us to think of tearing in pieces, lacerating, but discerpere, plucking or pulling to pieces.
