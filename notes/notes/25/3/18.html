There was “no help for him from his God;” even that hope had left him. But, as the sequel shows, this despair was the beginning of a reaction.

In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe.

Some understand it of spiritual strength to do good, and of hope of having good things, or deliverance from the hand of God, which they were despairing of; for the words are the language of despondency, and betray great, weakness and infirmity; for in the Lord is everlasting strength, and he is the hope of his people, and the Saviour of them in time of trouble, <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>. <p>(r) "duratio mea", Montanus; "perennitas mea", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I said, My strength and my <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> hope hath perished from the LORD:</span><p>(g) Thus with pain he was driven to and fro between hope and despair, as the godly often are, yet in the end the spirit gets the victory.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He hath bent His bow," as in <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>.
