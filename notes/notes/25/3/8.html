In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe.

I take the ordinary course in that case, which is prayer, I pray fervently and aloud, as those that are serious and importunate for what they desire (for shouting here signifies no more than making a loud noise, not a loud noise of joy and rejoicing, as it mostly signifies); but he deals with me as great persons that have no mind to listen to suitors, and shut their gates against them, he shutteth out my supplications: which made their case wholly desperate and remediless. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also when I cry and shout,.... Cry, because of the distress of the enemy within; "shout", or cry aloud for help from others without; as persons in a prison do, to make them hear and pity their case: thus the prophet in his affliction cried aloud to God; was fervent, earnest, and importunate in prayer; and yet not heard: <p>he shutteth out my prayer; shuts the door, that it may not enter; as the door is sometimes shut upon beggars, that their cry may not be heard. The Targum is, <p>"the house of my prayer is shut.'' <p>Jarchi interprets it of the windows of the firmament being shut, so that his prayer could not pass through, or be heard; see <a href="/lamentations/3-44.htm">Lamentations 3:44</a>. The phrase designs God's disregard, or seeming disregard, of the prayer of the prophet, or of the people; and his shutting his ears against it. Of this, as the Messiah's case, see <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> prayer.</span><p>(c) This is a great temptation for the godly when they do not see the fruit of their prayers and causes them to think that they are not heard, which thing God uses so that they might pray more earnestly and often.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shutteth out my prayer.</span> There is a kind of barrier through which these futile prayers cannot penetrate (comp. on ver. 44). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Me hath He (God) led and brought through darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, local accus.), and not light," is a combination like that in <a href="/job/12-25.htm">Job 12:25</a> and <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>. The path of Jeremiah's life certainly lay through darkness, but was not wholly devoid of light, because God had promised him His protection for the discharge of his official functions.
