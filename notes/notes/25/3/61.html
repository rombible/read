Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution.

But could he possibly think that the Lord had forgotten this? What, we should like to know, would be the use of this reminder, even if '&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>, could be taken as the words of address to the Lord? For we can discover no thanksgiving in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-58</a>. This whole mode of viewing the passage breaks down before <a href="/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a> : "Thou hast seen mine oppression; judge me!" For, if the perfects in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-58</a> are preterites, then also &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a>, can only be a preterite; and the prophet can only be speaking of injustice that has been done him previously: hence he cannot add thereto the request, "Judge me," inasmuch as the Lord  (according to Ngelsbach) has already judged him by delivering him from the pit. Moreover, it is quite arbitrary to understand the perfects in <a href="/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3-62.htm">Lamentations 3:62</a> as referring to what has been done and is still being done to the speaker by his enemies, if it be agreed that the perfects in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-58</a> refer only to past events.)<p>but expresses what has already happened, and still happens. This is evident from the fact that the corresponding perfect, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>, is continued by the optative &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is taken from <a href="/psalms/88-7.htm">Psalm 88:7</a> : "pit of the lower regions of the earth,"-the &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, i.e., Sheol, essentially the same with &#1502;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-6.htm">Lamentations 3:6</a>, which is thereby connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88-7.htm">Psalm 88:7</a>, - the dark regions of the depth, whose open mouth is the grave for every one (see Delitzsch on Psalms, l.c.), hence the symbol of mortal danger.</body></html>
