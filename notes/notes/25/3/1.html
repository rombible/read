Had a much experience of it, especially ever since he had been a prophet; being reproached and ill used by his own people, and suffering with them in their calamities; particularly, as Jarchi observes, his affliction was greater than the other prophets, who indeed prophesied of the destruction of the city and temple, but did not see it; whereas he lived to see it: he was not indeed the only man that endured affliction, but he was remarkable for his afflictions; he had a large share of them, and was herein a type of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs: <p>by the rod of his wrath; that is, by the rod of the wrath of God, for he is understood; it is a relative without an antecedent, as in Sol 1:1; unless the words are to be considered in connection <a href="/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>.

In order to turn the thoughts of the people in this direction, the prophet lays emphasis on the fact that God has now executed this destruction which He has threatened long before, and has prepared for the triumph of the enemy. "Jahveh hath done what He hath purposed," has now performed the word which He has commanded all along from the days of yore. Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/1-6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>) also lays this truth before the heart of his contemporaries. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;, to cut off, is used metaphorically in the sense of finishing, completing, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>. To fulfil a word that has been ordered, signifies to execute it. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; does not mean to announce, but to command, order; the word has been chosen, not merely with reference to the fact that the threatened rejection of Israel was announced in the law, but also with regard to the circumstance that the threat of punishment for sins is an evidence of the moral government of the world, and the holiness of the Lord and Ruler of the world demands the punishment of every act of rebellion against the government and decrees of God. "The days of old" are the times of Moses; for Jeremiah has before his mind the threatenings of the law, <a href="/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23</a>., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>. "Without sparing," as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>) has announced to the people. In the following clause, "He hath made thine enemy rejoice over thee," thoughts are reproduced from <a href="/psalms/89-43.htm">Psalm 89:43</a>. To "exalt the horn" means to grant power and victory; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5</a>.</body></html>
