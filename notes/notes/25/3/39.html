And from the doctrine of God’s sovereign and universal providence, which he had asserted in the last two verses, he draws this inference, <span class="ital">Wherefore doth a living man complain? a man for the punishment of his sins? — </span>No calamity or trouble befalls us, but what is the due reward of our sins; and is designed as a chastisement for them, in order to our purification and amendment, or for the trial of our grace, and in order to the exercise and increase of it. If we view our afflictions in this light, it will prevent all murmuring and repining against the providence of God. We shall learn to be patient and resigned under his chastising hand, and even thankful that he condescends to correct and try us for our profit, and by preserving us alive in the body still gives us space for repentance. “There seems,” says Blaney, “to be a peculiar emphasis laid on the words <span class="greekheb">חי</span>, [<span class="ital">living,</span>] and <span class="greekheb">גבר</span>, [<span class="ital">man,</span>] in this passage. <span class="greekheb">גבר</span>is said to denote <span class="ital">a man, </span>because of his excellence and superiority over all other earthly beings. While a man therefore <span class="ital">lives, </span>and is possessed of those privileges of his nature, whatever he undergoes must be less than his sins have deserved, because death, which implies the loss of all those privileges, is the allotted wages of sin.” Mark well, reader, though we may pour out our complaints before God, we must never complain against or of God. How cogent are the reasons here suggested against such a conduct! We are <span class="ital">men, </span>let us herein show ourselves men. Shall a <span class="ital">man complain? </span>Shall a reasonable creature act contrary to all reason, and an immortal being forget or disregard his immortality? Shall he be so insensible of the value of the privileges of his nature, and of his obligations to God for them, as to abuse them to God’s dishonour, instead of using them to his glory? Shall he take upon him to censure or call in question the dispensations of infinite wisdom, justice, and goodness toward him, and act as if he thought he knew better than his Maker what is good for him? <span class="ital">Shall a living man complain — </span>a man who has a thousand times forfeited his life, with all the blessings of it, but to whom it is still continued, and with it many of its comforts, and particularly the means of attaining life everlasting — a hope, or a foundation whereon to build a hope, of felicity and glory for ever? <span class="ital">A man for the punishment of his sins? </span>A punishment infinitely less than his sins have deserved? and a punishment, or <span class="ital">chastisement, </span>rather, which the omniscient God knows to be absolutely necessary to bring him to repentance and reformation, if he will by any means whatever be brought thereto? Surely, reader, if we be suffering for our sins, instead of spending our time in complaining and repining, we ought to be employed in repenting and reforming, and, that we may have at least one evidence that God is reconciled to us, we should endeavour to reconcile ourselves to his holy and gracious will. Or, to consider the matter in another point of view: Are we <span class="ital">punished for our sins? </span>It is then our wisdom to submit, and kiss the rod; for if we still walk contrary to God, he will punish us still seven times more, for <span class="ital">when he judgeth he will overcome; </span>but if we accommodate ourselves to him, though we be chastened of the Lord, we shall not be condemned with the world.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:37-41 While there is life there is hope; and instead of complaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with the hope they will be better. We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers.

But the word is noted most generally to signify complaining or murmuring. The word also which we translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sin</span> sometimes signifieth that oblique act which we call sin; and those who interpret the former grieve or vex, thus understand the word translated sin, supplying some such words as these, <span class="ital">Let him mourn for his sin</span>.

It does not become "a man", a reasonable creature, a man grown up, to behave in this manner; as such should quit themselves like men, and conduct as such; a "man" that God is so mindful of, and cares for, and visits every moment, and follows with his goodness continually; a "man", sinful man, that has rendered himself unworthy of the least favour; and yet such is the lovingkindness, favour, and good will of God to man, that he has provided his own Son to be his Saviour; and therefore man, of all God's creatures, has no reason to complain of him; and is a "living" man too, in a natural sense; is upheld in life by the Lord, and has the common mercies of life; is in health, or however in the land of the living; out of hell, where he deserves to be; and therefore should praise, and not complain, <a href="/isaiah/38-19.htm">Isaiah 38:19</a>; especially if he is a living man in a spiritual sense; has a principle of spiritual life implanted in him; Christ lives in him, and his life is hid with him in God, and has a right and title to eternal life: <p>a man for the punishment of his sins? the word "punishment" is not in the text; but, admitting the supplement, if a man is a wicked man (and so the Targum interprets it), and is punished for his sins, no injustice is done him; he has no reason to complain; and especially of his punishment in this world, which is greatly less than his sins deserve, <a href="/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>; and if he is a good man, and is chastised for his sins, he ought not to complain "for the chastisement" of them; since it is the chastisement of a father, is in love, and for his good: but the words may be rendered literally, "a man for", or "of his sins" (l); and be considered as a distinct clause, and as an answer to the former, so Jarchi; if a man will complain, let him complain of his sins; of the corruptions of his heart; of the body of sin and death he carries about with him of his daily iniquities; let him mourn over them, and bemoan himself for them; and if he does this in an evangelic manner, he is happy; for he shall be comforted. <p>(k) Sept.
