The acknowledgment of guilt implies to prayer, to which also there is a summons in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40</a>, <a href="/lamentations/3-41.htm">Lamentations 3:41</a>. The transitional idea is not, "Instead of grumbling in a sinful spirit, let us rather examine our conduct" (Thenius); for the summons to examine one's conduct is thereby placed in contrast with <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-39.htm">Lamentations 3:39</a>, and the thought, "let every one mourn over his own sins," transformed into a prohibition of sinful complaint. The real transition link is given by Rosenmller: quum mala nostra a peccatis nostris oriantur, culpas nostras et scrutemur et corrigamus. The searching of our ways, i.e., of our conduct, if it be entered on in an earnest spirit, must end in a return to the Lord, from whom we have departed. It is self-evident that &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; does not stand for &#1488;&#1500; &#1497;&#1497;, but means as far as (even to) Jahveh, and indicates thorough conversion - no standing half-way. The lifting up of the heart to the hands, also, - not merely of the hands to God, - expresses earnest prayer, that comes from the heart. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, to the hands (that are raised towards heaven). "To God in heaven," where His almighty throne is placed (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>), that He may look down from thence (<a href="/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a>) and send help. With <a href="/lamentations/3-42.htm">Lamentations 3:42</a> begins the prayer, as is shown by the direct address to God in the second member. There is no need, however, on this account, for supplying &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before the first member; the command to pray is immediately followed by prayer, beginning with the confession of sins, and the recognition of God's chastisement; cf. <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is contrasted with &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. "Thou hast not pardoned," because Thy justice must inflict punishment.</body></html>
