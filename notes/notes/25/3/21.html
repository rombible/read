God’s mercy and truth, or fidelity, are usually joined together. Blaney connects these three verses thus: “This I revolve in my heart, therefore will I have hope; the mercies of Jehovah, that they are not exhausted, that they fail not; new are his compassions every morning; great is thy faithfulness.” According to our translation the prophet represents himself as calling to mind that, as a sinner, he deserved to be cut off, and delivered up to future punishment, and should certainly have been thus destroyed but for the mercies of God; while his people, for their sins, would have been so totally consumed that no remnant of them would have been left. “As, however, the Lord had mercifully spared him, and had not utterly destroyed them; as his compassions were plenteous and unfailing, and every morning renewed to him, in the continuance of his life, and many unmerited benefits; and as God had given many precious promises to Israel, and to every believer, and, in his great faithfulness, had always performed them to those who trusted in them; so he found there was yet encouragement to hope, and to exercise patience and repentance in expectation of returning comfort.” — Scott.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-36 Having stated his distress and temptation, the prophet shows how he was raised above it. Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This I recall - Rather, "This will I bring back to my heart, therefore will I hope."

This&#8212;namely, what follows; the view of the divine character (La 3:22, 23). Calvin makes "this" refer to Jeremiah's infirmity. His very weakness (La 3:19, 20) gives him hope of God interposing His strength for him (compare Ps 25:11, 17; 42:5, 8; 2Co 12:9, 10).<p>Cheth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This, not what was already said, that made them despair, and their souls to bow down; but this, that which followeth, concerning the nature of God, and other good providences. I see nothing in the circumstances of my condition to comfort me, but I see something in God’s nature, and in some other dispensations of his providence, which gives me ground to hope for better things than an utter ruin and destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This I recall to my mind,.... Not affliction and misery, but the Lord's remembrance of his people; what he had been used to do, and would do again; and particularly what follows, the abundant mercy of God, and his great faithfulness; these things the prophet fetched back to his mind; and revolved them in his heart; says he, <p>and therefore have I hope; this revived his hope, which he was ready to say was perished from the Lord, and there was no foundation for it; but now he saw there was, and therefore took heart, and encouraged himself in the grace and mercy of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>.

But the structure of the poem, <span class="ital"><a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm" title="This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.">Lamentations 3:21</a></span> being the third (and last) of its group, and the previous context form an argument that the last words of <span class="ital"><a href="/lamentations/3-20.htm" title="My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.">Lamentations 3:20</a></span> are what the prophet recalls for his comfort. The humility arising from sin dwelt upon and acknowledged produces in due course a sense that contrition will be accepted and deliverance granted. Hence arises the change of tone in the section which follows.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This I recall to my mind,</span> etc.; viz. that thou wilt remember me, or, thy faithfulness (ver. 20). Here again there appears to be a reminiscence of a passage in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>. (ver. 4). Others suppose that "this" refers to the following verses; but in this case a new section would begin in the middle of a triad (the triad of verses beginning with <span class="accented">zayin</span>), which is certainly improbable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He fills me with bitternesses" is a reminiscence from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-18.htm">Job 9:18</a>, only &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; being exchanged for &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. Of these two forms, the first occurs only in Job, l.c.; the latter denotes, in <a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-11.htm">Numbers 9:11</a>, "bitter herbs," but here "bitternesses." The reality (viz., bitter sorrow) is what Jeremiah threatens the people with in <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>. The figure employed in <a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a> is still stronger. "He made my teeth be ground down on gravel." &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; means a gravel stone, gravel, <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (which occurs only in <a href="/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a> as well as here, and is allied to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, from which comes &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, something crushed, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/2-16.htm">Leviticus 2:16</a>) signifies to be ground down, and in Hiphil to grind down, not to cause to grind; hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1510;&#1509; cannot be taken as a second object, "He made my teeth grind gravel" (Ewald); but the words simply mean, "He ground my teeth on the gravel," i.e., He made them grind away on the gravel. As regards the application of the words, we cannot follow the older expositors in thinking of bread mixed with stones, but must view the giving of stones for bread as referring to cruel treatment. The lxx have rendered &#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, the Vulgate by cibavit me cinere. This translation has not been lexically established, but is a mere conjecture from <a href="/psalms/102-10.htm">Psalm 102:10</a>.

Buxtorf, Lex. Rabb. s.v. Similarly, the Chaldee had previously explained the words to mean humiliavit ( )&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;me in cinere; and Raschi, &#1499;&#1508;&#1492; inclinavit s. subegit me. Luther follows these in his rendering, "He rolls me in the ashes," which is a figure signifying the deepest disgrace and humiliation, or a hyperbolical expression for sprinkling with ashes (<a href="/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>), as a token of descent into the depths of sorrow.</body></html>
