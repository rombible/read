In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup.

Or caused me to depart or go back from the way I was in, and so fall into the hand of the enemy that lay in wait, as before. Jarchi interprets the word of thorns, and of scattering the way with thorns, and hedging it up with them, so that there was no passing, <a href="/hosea/2-6.htm">Hosea 2:6</a>; the sense seems to be the same with <a href="/lamentations/3-9.htm">Lamentations 3:9</a>; <p>and pulled me in pieces: as any creature that falls into the hands of a bear or lion. Jarchi says it signifies a stopping of the feet, so that the traveller cannot go on in his way; and in the Talmudic language it is used for the breaking off of branches of trees, which being strowed in the way, hinder passengers from travelling; and this sense agrees with what goes before: <p>he hath made me desolate; or brought me into a desolate condition, into ruin and destruction, as the Jews were in Babylon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

Gesenius, 142, 3, b. "His hand" is the smiting hand of God. &#1488;&#1498;, "only upon me," expresses the feeling which makes him on whom grievous sufferings have fallen to regard himself as one smitten in a special manner by God. "The whole day," i.e., continually; cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. - From <a href="/lamentations/3-4.htm">Lamentations 3:4</a> onwards this divine chastisement is more minutely set forth under various figures, and first of all as a wasting away of the vital force. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; means to wear out by rubbing, cause to fall away, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to be worn out, which is applied to clothes, and then transferred to bodies, <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>. "Flesh and skin" are the exterior and soft constituents of the body, while the bones are the firmer parts. Skin, flesh, and bones together, make up the substance of the human body. <a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> forms the foundation of the first clause. "He hath broken my bones" is a reminiscence from the lamentation of Hezekiah in <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>. The meaning is thus excellently given by Pareau: indicantur animi, fortius irae divinae malorumque sensu conquassati, angores. - The figure in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-5.htm">Lamentations 3:5</a>, "He builds round about and encircles me," is derived from the enclosing of a city by besieging it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is to be repeated after wayaqeep. The besieging forces, which encompass him so that he cannot go out and in, are &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;. That the former of these two words cannot mean &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (lxx), is abundantly evident. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is a plant with a very bitter taste, hence a poisonous plant; see on <a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>. As in that passage &#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, so here the simple &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is an emblem of bitter suffering. The combination with &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, "toil," is remarkable, as a case in which a figurative is joined with a literal expression; this, however, does not justify the change of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (Castell, Schleussner, etc.). The combination is to be explained on the ground that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; had become so common a symbol of bitter suffering, that the figure was quite lost sight of behind the thing signified.</body></html>
