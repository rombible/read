By <span class="ital">the prisoners of the earth, </span>or <span class="ital">of the land, </span>as the words may be properly rendered, Blaney thinks are meant the poor insolvent debtors, whom their creditors among the Jews, as well as in other nations, were empowered to cast into prison, and to oblige to work out their debts; a power too often exerted with great rigour and inhumanity: see <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm" title="Why have we fasted, say they, and you see not? why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors.">Isaiah 58:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-30.htm" title="And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.">Matthew 18:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-34.htm" title="And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.">Matthew 18:34</a>. <span class="ital">To turn aside the right of a man — </span>To prevent his obtaining, or to deprive him of, his just rights; <span class="ital">before the face of the Most High </span>— In the presence of the just and holy God, and under his all-seeing eye, who takes particular notice of all acts of injustice, and will severely punish them. The word <span class="greekheb">עליון</span>, here used, undoubtedly often means the <span class="ital">most high God, </span>and is so understood here, both by the LXX. and the Vulgate. Many commentators, however, prefer the marginal reading, <span class="ital">a superior, </span>understanding thereby a magistrate. And Blaney thinks it cannot here mean God, because, “though a person may be made to suffer greatly by having his judgment turned aside, that is, by being calumniated and misrepresented before an earthly superior, yet all such malicious attempts must fail and come to nothing where God is the judge, who cannot be deceived or imposed upon.” This is certainly true: but it does not appear that the prophet referred to this circumstance, but rather to the effrontery and daring wickedness of those who could be guilty of such injustice, when they knew they were before the omnipresent God, and that his eye was upon them, thus, as it were, bidding him defiance. <span class="ital">To subvert a man in his cause — </span>That is, to prevent his having justice done him, in a law-suit or controversy, by any undue interference; as by bearing or suborning false witness, or exerting any kind of influence in opposition to truth and right: <span class="ital">the Lord approveth not — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לא ראה</span>, <span class="ital">seeth not: </span>that is, hates such conduct, and turns away his face from it with abhorrence and disgust. Thus we read, <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm" title="You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity: why look you on them that deal treacherously, and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he?">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, <span class="ital">Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil; and canst not look on iniquity. </span>The general sense of the passage is, as God takes no pleasure in oppressing the poor and helpless, so neither will he suffer any men to escape unpunished that are guilty of such acts of injustice and cruelty, who never consider that all the wrongs they do are committed in the sight of the Supreme Judge of the world; and although for a time he thinks fit to prosper such oppressors, yet, in due time, he will call them to a severe account for their wickedness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-36 Having stated his distress and temptation, the prophet shows how he was raised above it. Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither does God approve of wanton cruelty inflicted by one man on another.

This triplet has an infinitive in the beginning of each verse, the governing finite verb being in the end of La 3:36, "the Lord approveth not," which is to be repeated in each verse. Jeremiah here anticipates and answers the objections which the Jews might start, that it was by His connivance they were "crushed under the feet" of those who "turned aside the right of a man." God approves (literally, "seeth," Hab 1:13; so "behold," "look on," that is, look on with approval) not of such unrighteous acts; and so the Jews may look for deliverance and the punishment of their foes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

The expression is based on <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>, where the Lord says to Aaron, "I am thy portion and thine inheritance;" i.e., Jahveh will be to the tribe of Levi what the other tribes receive in their territorial possessions in Canaan; Levi shall have his possession and enjoyment in Jahveh. The last clause, "therefore will I hope," etc., is a repetition of what is in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>, as if by way of refrain.<p>This hope cannot be frustrated, <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>. The fundamental idea of the section contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-33</a> is thus stated by Ngelsbach: "The Lord is well disposed towards the children of men under all circumstances; for even when He smites them, He seeks their highest interest: they ought so to conduct themselves in adversity, that it is possible for Him to carry out His designs." On <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>; and on the general meaning, also <a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a>. If the Lord is kind to those who hope in Him, then it is good for man to wait patiently for His help in suffering. Such is the mode in which <a href="/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a> is attached to <a href="/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>, followed by &#1500; dat., means to be good for one, i.e., beneficial. Some expositors (Gesenius, Rosenmller, Maurer, Ngelsbach) take &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as a noun-form, substantive or adjective; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; is then also taken in the same way, and &#1493; - &#1493; as correlative: "it is good both to wait and be silent." But although there are analogous cases to support the view that &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; is a noun-form, the constant employment of &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; as an adverb quite prevents us from taking it as an adjective. Moreover, "to be silent for the help of the Lord," would be a strange expression, and we would rather expect "to be silent and wait for;" and finally, waiting and silence are so closely allied, that the disjunctive &#1493; - &#1493; et - et appears remarkable. We prefer, then, with Ewald (Gram. &#1431;235, a) and others, to take &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as a verbal form, and that, too, in spite of the i in the jussive form of the Hiphil for &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, in the meaning of &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, to wait, tarry. "It is good that he (man) should wait, and in silence too (i.e., without complaining), for the help of the Lord." On the thought presented here, cf. <a href="/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>. Hence it is also good for man to bear a yoke in youth (<a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>), that he may exercise himself in calm waiting on the help of the Lord. In the present context the yoke is that of sufferings, and the time of youth is mentioned as the time of freshness and vigour, which render the bearing of burdens more easy. He who has learned in youth to bear sufferings, will not sink into despair should they come on him in old age. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, Theodotion has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, which is also the reading of the Aldine edition of the lxx; and some codices have &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;. But this reading is evidently a correction, prompted by the thought that Jeremiah, who composed the Lamentations in his old age, had much suffering to endure from the time of his call to the prophetic office, in the earlier portion of his old age; nor is it much better than the inference of J. D. Michaelis, that Jeremiah composed this poem when a youth, on the occasion of King Josiah's death. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-28.htm">Lamentations 3:28-30</a>, the effect of experience by suffering is set forth, yet not in such a way that the verses are to be taken as still dependent on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a> (Luther, Pareau, De Wette, Maurer, and Thenius): "that he should sit alone and be silent," etc. Such a combination is opposed to the independent character of each separate alphabetic strophe. Rather, the result of early experience in suffering and patience is developed in a cohortative form. The connection of thought is simply as follows: Since it is good for man that he should learn to endure suffering, let him sit still and bear it patiently, when God puts such a burden on him. Let him sit solitary, as becomes those in sorrow (see on <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>), and be silent, without murmuring (cf. <a href="/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>), when He lays a burden on him. There is no object to &#1504;&#1496;&#1500; expressly mentioned, but it is easily understood from the notion of the verb (if He lays anything on him), or from &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a> (if He lays a yoke on him). We are forbidden to consider the verbs as indicatives ("he sits alone and is silent;" Gerlach, Ngelsbach) by the apocopated form &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-29.htm">Lamentations 3:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, which shows that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; are also cohortatives.</body></html>
