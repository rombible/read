Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope?

It is not because God had not power enough utterly to have consumed us, nor because we had not guilt enough to have provoked his justice to have put an end to our lives, as well as to the lives of many thousands of our countrymen, but it is merely from the Lord’s free love and pity to us in our miseries. If God had not a blessing in store for us, how is it that we are captives, and not slain as many others were during the siege? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed,.... It was true of the prophet, that he died not in prison, or in the dungeon; and of the people of the Jews, who though many of them perished by the sword, famine, and pestilence, yet God did not make a full end of them, according to his gracious promise, <a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; but left them a seed, a remnant, from whence the Messiah, the mercy promised, should come, and to which it was owing they were not utterly cut off for their sins: nor are any of the Lord's special people ever consumed; their estates may be consumed, and so may their bodies by wasting diseases, and at last by death; but not their souls, not only as to their being, but as to their well being, here and hereafter; though their peace, joy, and comfort, may be gone for a while, through temptation, desertion, and the prevalence of corruption; and they may be in declining circumstances, as to the exercise of grace, yet the principle itself can never be lost; faith, hope, and love, will abide; nor can they eternally perish, or be punished with an everlasting destruction: all which is to be ascribed not to their own strength to preserve themselves, nor to any want of desert in them to be destroyed, or of power in God to consume them; but to his "mercies" and "goodnesses", the multitude of them; for there is an abundance of mercy, grace, and goodness in God, and various are the instances of it; as in the choice of his people to grace and glory; in the covenant of grace, and the blessings of it they are interested in; in redemption by Christ; in regeneration by his Spirit; in the forgiveness of their sins; and in their complete salvation; which are all so many reasons why they are not, and shall not be, consumed. The words may be rendered, "the mercies" or "goodnesses of the Lord, for they are not consumed", or, "that the mercies of the Lord", &amp;c. (w) Jarchi observes, that "tamnu" is as "tammu"; the "nun" being inserted, according to Aben Ezra, instead of doubling the letter "mem"; and the former makes the sense to be this, in connection with the <a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>; "this I recall to mind the mercies of the Lord, that they are not consumed"; to which agrees the Targum, <p>"the goodnesses, of the Lord, for they cease not;'' <p>and so the Septuagint, "the mercies of the Lord, for they have not left me"; and to the same sense the Syriac version is, "the mercies of the Lord, for they have no end", and Aben Ezra's note on the text is almost in the same words, <p>"for there is no end to the mercies of God;'' <p>because his compassions fail not; or, "his tender mercies" (x); of which he is full, and which are bestowed in a free and sovereign way, and are the spring of all good things, and a never failing one they are; and this is another reason why the Lord's people are not consumed, and never shall, because of the mercies of the Lord, since these shall never fail; for though they are, yet should they fail, they might be consumed; but these are from everlasting to everlasting, and are kept with Christ their covenant head; see <a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>. <p>(w)     "quod misericordiae Jehovae deficiunt", vel "defecerunt", so some in Vatablus; "studia Jehovae quod non defecerunt", Cocceius.

There are metrical irregularities in these <span class="ital">vv</span>. as they stand. We should probably (with Löhr) read the first, “The Lord’s compassion ceaseth not”; “His love is not spent,” and the second, which is now too short in its first part, we may safely extend by supplying from the former clause “New is thy compassion every morning.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-36.</span> - RESIGNATION AND HOPEFULNESS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - It is of <span class="cmt_word">the Lord's mercies</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">The Lord's mercies that we are not consumed.</span> But the "we" is difficult, especially considering that in ver. 23 (which is clearly parallel) the subject of the sentence is, not "we," but "the Lord's mercies." Hence it is probable that the reading of the Targum and the Peshite (adopted by Thenius, Ewald, and Bickell) is correct, "The Lord's mercies, verily they cease not" (<span class="accented">tammu</span> for <span class="accented">tamnu</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He fills me with bitternesses" is a reminiscence from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-18.htm">Job 9:18</a>, only &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; being exchanged for &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. Of these two forms, the first occurs only in Job, l.c.; the latter denotes, in <a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-11.htm">Numbers 9:11</a>, "bitter herbs," but here "bitternesses." The reality (viz., bitter sorrow) is what Jeremiah threatens the people with in <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>. The figure employed in <a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a> is still stronger. "He made my teeth be ground down on gravel." &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; means a gravel stone, gravel, <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (which occurs only in <a href="/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a> as well as here, and is allied to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, from which comes &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, something crushed, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/2-16.htm">Leviticus 2:16</a>) signifies to be ground down, and in Hiphil to grind down, not to cause to grind; hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1510;&#1509; cannot be taken as a second object, "He made my teeth grind gravel" (Ewald); but the words simply mean, "He ground my teeth on the gravel," i.e., He made them grind away on the gravel. As regards the application of the words, we cannot follow the older expositors in thinking of bread mixed with stones, but must view the giving of stones for bread as referring to cruel treatment. The lxx have rendered &#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, the Vulgate by cibavit me cinere. This translation has not been lexically established, but is a mere conjecture from <a href="/psalms/102-10.htm">Psalm 102:10</a>.

Buxtorf, Lex. Rabb. s.v. Similarly, the Chaldee had previously explained the words to mean humiliavit ( )&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;me in cinere; and Raschi, &#1499;&#1508;&#1492; inclinavit s. subegit me. Luther follows these in his rendering, "He rolls me in the ashes," which is a figure signifying the deepest disgrace and humiliation, or a hyperbolical expression for sprinkling with ashes (<a href="/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>), as a token of descent into the depths of sorrow.</body></html>
