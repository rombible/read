"Thou summonest, as for a feast-day (viz., for the enemy, cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>), all my terrors round about." &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is to be explained in conformity with the formula &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, so frequent in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, etc.): &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is therefore to be derived from &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, but not to be confined in its reference to the enemy (as in the Vulgate, qui terrent); it is rather to be understood as applying to all the terrible powers that had come upon Judah, - sword, famine, plagues (cf. <a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>). On the ground that &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; elsewhere means wandering, pilgrimage, and that, moreover, the sing. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a> signifies a dwelling, Ewald translates the expression in the text, "my hamlets round about," understanding by that the inhabitants of the defenceless country towns and villages, which stand to the capital that gave them its protection in the relation of settlers in its neighbourhood (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). According to this view, the verse alludes to an important event which took place in those days of the siege, when all the inhabitants of the country towns fled to the capital, thinking that a great festival was going to be held there, as on former occasions; but this became at last for them the great festival of death, when the city was taken. But the translation of the lxx is of no authority, since they have given a false rendering of &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; also; and the whole explanation is so artificial and unnatural, that it needs no further refutation. Raschi, indeed, had previously explained &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; to mean &#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, vicinos meos, but added improbos, ut sese congregarent adversus me ad perdendum. Notwithstanding this, &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "wandering" and "place of sojourn," cannot denote the country towns as distinguished from the capital; nor can the flight of the inhabitants of the low-lying regions into the capital be fitly called a summoning together of them by the Lord. The combination &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496; &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; is used as in <a href="/jeremiah/42-17.htm">Jeremiah 42:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14</a>. For &#1496;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, see on <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>. With the complaint that no one could escape the judgment, - that the enemy dared to murder even the children whom she Jerusalem had carefully nourished and brought up, - the poem concludes, like the first, with deep sorrow, regarding which all attempts at comfort are quite unavailing (Gerlach). </body></html>
