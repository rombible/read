We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers.

Some think they are brought in to check the blasphemy of some that spake of what had befallen the Jews as a thing which God had no hand in. Others think they are brought in as expounding that term that went before, <span class="ital">The Lord seeth not</span>. Though God doth not approve of sinful actions, nor incline any man’s heart or will to them, yet God hath a hand in the permission of the most cruel and unjust actions, which he could easily hinder. I should rather incline to interpret them as an argument brought by the prophet in the name of the people of God, arguing themselves into a quiet submission to the afflictive providences under which they laboured from the consideration of the superior hand of God in them; as Christ told Pilate, Thou couldst not have had any power against me, if it had not been given thee from above. <span class="ital">Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it</span>? <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/3-6.htm" title="Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?">Amos 3:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass?....

On <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3</a>, etc. There is a certain gradation in the three verses that it quite unmistakeable. The sitting alone and in silence is comparatively the easiest; it is harder to place the mouth in the dust, and yet cling to hope; it is most difficult of all to give the cheek to the smiter, and to satiate oneself with dishonour (Ngelsbach). In <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a> follow the grounds of comfort. The first is in <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a> : the sorrow will come to an end; the Lord does not cast off for ever; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. The second is in <a href="/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a> : when He has caused sorrow, He shows pity once more, according to the fulness of His grace. Compassion outweighs sorrow. On this subject, cf. <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>. The third ground of comfort is in <a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a> : God does not send affliction willingly, as if it brought Him joy (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>), but merely because chastisement is necessary to sinful man for the increase of his spiritual prosperity; cf. <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;: cf. Ewald, 232, f; Gesenius, 69, 3, Rem. 6.<p>That he may bring home to the hearts of God's people the exhortation to bear suffering with patience and resignation, and that he may lead them to see that the weight of sorrow under which they are sighing has been sent from the Lord as a chastisement for their sins, the prophet carries out the thought, in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-39</a>, that every wrong committed upon earth is under the divine control (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-36</a>), and generally that nothing happens without God's permission; hence man ought not to mourn over the suffering that befalls him, but rather over his sins (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-39</a>).</body></html>
