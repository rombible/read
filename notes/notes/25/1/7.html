If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case.

Maurer translates it "ruin." But English Version better expresses the point of their "mocking," namely, their involuntary "Sabbaths," that is, the cessation of all national movements.

When carried captive, and in exile in a foreign land; when surrounded with distresses and calamities of various kinds; which are a means sometimes of rubbing up and refreshing the memories of persons with those good things they take little notice of in the times of prosperity; the worth of such things being best known and prized by the want of them: even <p>all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old; her civil and religious liberties; the word, worship, and ordinances of God; the temple, altars, and courts of the Lord; the ark of the testimony, the symbol of the divine Presence; and the revelation of the will of God by the prophets; their peace, prosperity, and enjoyment of all good things: these were remembered <p>when her people fell into the hand of the enemy; the Chaldeans. The Targum is, <p>"into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, and he oppressed them:'' <p>and none did help her; not the Egyptians, her allies and confederates, in whom she trusted: <p>her adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths; as the Heathens used to do; calling the Jews Sabbatarians (o); by way of derision; representing them as an idle lazy people, who observed a seventh day merely out of sloth, and so lost a seventh part of time (p); or they mocked at them for keeping them in vain; since, notwithstanding their religious observance of them, they were suffered to be carried captive out of their land; or, as Jarchi thinks, the Chaldeans mocked at them for keeping their sabbaths strictly, now they were in other lands, when they neglected them in their own country; or they jeered them with their weekly and yearly sabbaths; suggesting to them that now they had leisure enough to observe them; and that their land ceased from tillage with a witness now: some think, that because of the observance of a sabbath, they were obliged to by their law, therefore the Heathens made them work the harder, and imposed greater tasks upon them on that day than on others, like the Egyptians of old; though the words may be rendered, "they mocked at her cessations" (q); from joy and pleasure, peace and comfort, and the enjoyment of all good things; so the Targum, <p>"the enemies saw her when she went into captivity; and they mocked at the good things which ceased out of the midst of her.'' <p>(o) "Quod jejunia sabbatariorum".

In these verses the prophet, in the name of the godly, pours out his heart before the Lord. The dreadful turn that things have taken is briefly declared in <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a> in two clauses, which set forth the fall of Jerusalem from its former glory into the depths of disgrace and misery, in such a way that the verse contains the subject unfolded in the description that follows. We have deviated from the Masoretic pointing, and arranged the verse into three members, as in the succeeding verses, which nearly throughout form tristichs, and have been divided into two halves by means of the Athnach; but we agree with the remark of Gerlach, "that, according to the sense, &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1502;&#1505; and not &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; is the proper antithesis to &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;." &#1488;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; is here, as in <a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-2</a>, an expression of complaint mingled with astonishment; so in <a href="/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>. "She sits solitary" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>) is intensified by "she has become like a widow." Her sitting alone is a token of deep sorrow (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>), and, as applied to a city, is a figure of desolation; cf. <a href="/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>. Here, however, the former reference is the main one; for Jerusalem is personified as a woman, and, with regard to its numerous population, is viewed as the mother of a great multitude of children. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; is a form of the construct state, lengthened by Yod compaginis, found thrice in this verse, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, elegiac composition; such forms are used, in general, only in poetry that preserves and affects the antique style, and reproduces its peculiar ring.<p>(Note: On the different views regarding the origin and meaning of this Yod compaginis, cf. Fr. W. M. Philippi, Wesen u. Ursprung des Status constr. im Hebr. S. 96ff. This writer (S. 152ff.) takes it to be the remnant of a primitive Semitic noun-inflexion, which has been preserved only in a number of composite proper names of ancient origin e.g., &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1511;, etc.]; in the words &#1488;&#1489;, &#1488;&#1495;, and &#1495;&#1501;, in which it has become fused with the third radical into a long vowel; and elsewhere only between two words standing in the construct relation see Ges. 90; Ewald, 211.)<p>According to the twofold meaning of &#1512;&#1489; (Much and Great), &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in the first clause designates the multiplicity, multitude of the population; in the second, the greatness or dignity of the position that Jerusalem assumed among the nations, corresponding to the &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, "a princess among the provinces." &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (properly, the circuit of judgment or jurisdiction), is the technical expression for the provinces of the empires in Asia (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-22.htm">Esther 1:22</a>, etc.), and hence, after the exile, was sued of Judah, <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a>, and in <a href="/1_kings/20-17.htm">1 Kings 20:17</a> of the districts in the kingdom of Israel. Here, however, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are not the circuits or districts of Judah (Thenius), but the provinces of the heathen nations rendered subject to the kingdom of Israel under David and Solomon (corresponding to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;), as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>. Jerusalem was formerly a princess among the provinces, during the flourishing period of the Jewish kingdom under David and Solomon. The writer keeps this time before his mind, in order to depict the contrast between the past and present. The city that once ruled over nations and provinces has now become but dependent on others. &#1502;&#1505; (the derivation of which is disputed) does not mean soccage or tribute, but the one who gives soccage service, a soccager; see on <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> and <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. The words, "The princess has become a soccager," signify nothing more than, "She who once ruled over peoples and countries has now fallen into abject servitude," and are not (with Thenius) to be held as "referring to the fact that the remnant that has been left behind, or those also of the former inhabitants of the city who have returned home, have been set to harder labour by the conquerors." When we find the same writer inferring from this, that these words presuppose a state of matters in which the country round Jerusalem has been for some time previously under the oppression of Chaldean officers, and moreover holding the opinion that the words "how she sits..." could only have been written by one who had for a considerable period been looking on Jerusalem in its desolate condition, we can only wonder at such an utter want of power to understand poetic language.</body></html>
