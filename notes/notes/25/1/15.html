Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?

As a causeway is trodden; or as mire is trodden under foot in the streets; so were the mighty and valiant men, the soldiers and men of war, trodden under foot and destroyed by the Chaldeans in the streets of Jerusalem, and in the midst of Judea; the Lord so permitting it: <p>he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men; the army of the Chaldeans, which were brought against Jerusalem by a divine appointment and call; against whom the choicest and stoutest of them, even their young men, could not stand; but were crushed and broken to pieces by them. The word for "assembly" sometimes signifies an appointed time; a time fixed for solemn festivals, and for calling the people to them; and so the Targum here, <p>"he hath called or appointed a time to break the strength of my young men;'' <p>the time of Jerusalem's destruction by the Babylonians: <p>the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress; in the winepress of his wrath; or however in the winepress of the Babylonians, who are compared to one; into whose hands the Jews falling, were like grapes cast into a winepress, and there trodden by men, in order to squeeze and get out the wine; and in like manner were their blood squeezed out of them and shed. The Targum interprets it of the blood of virginity being poured out, as wine in a press; the virgins of Judah being ravished and defiled by the enemy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty <i>men</i> in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, <i>as</i> in a <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> winepress.</span><p>(q) He has trodden them underfoot as they tread grapes in the winepress.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">hath called a solemn assembly</span>] or, sacrificial banquet.

The choicest youth of Judah are to be cut off like grapes from the vine. "Virgin daughter" is a frequent figure to express inviolate security (so <a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a> the figure if uncleanness is further developed. Her uncleanness sticks to the hems or skirts of her garment. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; is the defilement caused by touching a person or thing Levitically unclean, <a href="/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-21.htm">Leviticus 7:21</a>; here, therefore, it means defilement by sins and crimes. This has now been revealed by the judgment, because she did not think of her end. These words point to the warning given in the song of Moses, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a> : "If they were wise, they would understand this (that apostasy from the Lord brings heavy punishment after it), they would think of their end," i.e., the evil issue of continued resistance to God's commands. But the words are especially a quotation from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a>, where they are used of Babylon, that thought she would always remain mistress, and did not think of the end of her pride; therefore on her also came the sentence, "Come down from thy glory, sit in the dust," <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>.<p>Jerusalem has now experienced this also; she has come down wonderfully, or fallen from the height of her glory into the depths of misery and disgrace, where she has none to comfort her, and is constrained to sigh, "O Lord, behold my misery!" These words are to be taken as a sign from the daughter of Zion, deeply humbled through shame and repentance for her sins. This is required by the whole tenor of the words, and confirmed by a comparison with <a href="/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a> and <a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is used adverbially; cf. Ewald, 204, b [Gesenius, 100, 2, b.] There is no need for supplying anything after &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, although &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; originally stood with it, e.g., <a href="/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>; cf. Ewald, 122, c [and Gesenius' Lexicon, s.v. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;]. The clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, which assigns the reason, refers not merely to the sighing of Jerusalem, but also to the words, "and she came down wonderfully." The boasting of the enemy shows itself in the regardless, arrogant treatment not merely of the people and their property, but also of their holy things.</body></html>
