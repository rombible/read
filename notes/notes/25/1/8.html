The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grievously sinned - literally, "Jerusalem hath sinned a sin," giving the idea of a persistent continuance in wickedness.<p>Removed - Or, become an abomination.

The poet leaves out the preliminary clause, "therefore she is grievously punished." It was the humiliation of Jerusalem, rather than her sin, which brought upon her the contempt of her neighbours. The destruction of a city is often compared to the ill treatment of a defenceless woman (<a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this sorrow of hers she has not a single comforter, since all her friends from whom she could expect consolation have become faithless to her, and turned enemies. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; &#1514;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, "weeping she weeps," i.e., she weeps very much, or bitterly, not continually (Meier); the inf. abs. before the verb does not express the continuation, but the intensity of the action Gesenius, 131, 3, a; Ewald, 312]. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, "in the night," not "on into the night" (Ewald). The weeping by night does not exclude, but includes, weeping by day; cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>. Night is mentioned as the time when grief and sorrow are wont to give place to sleep. When tears do not cease to flow even during the night, the sorrow must be overwhelming. The following clause, "and her tears are upon her cheek," serves merely to intensify, and must not be placed (with Thenius) in antithesis to what precedes: "while her sorrow shows itself most violently during the loneliness of the night, her cheeks are yet always wet with tears (even during the day)." But the greatness of this sorrow of heart is due to the fact that she has no comforter, - a thought which is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>. For her friends are faithless, and have become enemies. "Lovers" and "friends" are the nations with which Jerusalem made alliances, especially Egypt (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>.); then the smaller nations round about, - Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Phoenicians, with which Zedekiah had conspired against the king of Babylon, <a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>.
