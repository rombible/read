Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Let all our sorrows lead us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark his example, and cheerfully to follow him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have heard ... - Or, "They heard that I sigh," that I have "no comforter."<p>Thou wilt bring the day ... - literally, thou hast brought "the day thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me."

Our Saviour’s precept most certainly is not to be so interpreted, but that we may lawfully pray for such evils to the implacable enemies of the church and people of God, as may restrain and weaken their hands, and put them out of a capacity of wasting the Lord’s heritage: we are only obliged by it to wish well to their souls, and to desire no evil against them out of private revenge or malice, but only out of love to God, and zeal for his glory; but for their outward prosperity in their courses of enmity we ought no more to pray than against their eternal salvation; for this were to beg of God to encourage his enemies in their enmity against him. And though Jeremiah were a greater prophet than any of us can pretend to be, and had revelations of particular future contingencies which we have not; yet every one may prophesy a ruin to the enemies of God’s church and people, and such as rejoice in their ruin; God never using a rod against his people which he doth not at last burn, nor ever countenacing inhumanity in any, but much less when it is rooted in a malice against himself, and his interest in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let all their wickedness come before thee,....

"Because of these things" refers to the painful realities mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13-15</a>, which Jerusalem has experienced.

Ges. 75, Rem. 5. The repetition of "my eye" gives greater emphasis, and is quite in the style of Jeremiah; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a> (<a href="/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>), <a href="/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>; the second &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; is not to be expunged (Pareau and Thenius), although it is not found in the lxx, Vulgate, Arabic, and some codices.

Gesenius, in his Thesaurus, appositely cites the German "sich die Augen aus dem Kopfe weinen" with which the English corresponds: "to weep one's eyes out of his head". Still stronger is the expression in <a href="/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>. But the sorrow becomes thus grievous, because the weeping one has none to comfort her; friends who could comfort her have faithlessly forsaken her (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>), and her sons are &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., destroyed, not "astonished" (<a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>), but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>, made desolate, i.e., made so unhappy that they cannot bring their mother comfort in her misery.
