The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sigh ... seek - Are sighing ... are seeking.

Her enemies, knowing that their power is supreme, and that Judah has been completely vanquished, are quite at ease, secure (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>). This unhappy fate Zion has brought on herself through the multitude of her own transgressions. Her children (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, children of tender age) are driven away by the enemy like a flock. The comparison to a flock of lambs is indicated by &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. But Zion has not merely lost what she loves most (the tender children), but all her glory; so that even her princes, enfeebled by hunger, cannot escape the pursuers, who overtake them and make them prisoners. Like deer that find no pasture, they flee exhausted before the pursuer. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has been rendered &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; by the lxx, and ut arietes by the Vulgate; hence Kalkschmidt, Bttcher (Aehrenl. S. 94), and Thenius would read &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, against which Rosenmller has remarked: perperam, nam hirci non sunt fugacia animalia, sed cervi. Raschi had already indicated the point of the comparison in the words, quibus nullae vires sunt ad effugiendum, fame eorum robore debilitato. The objections raised against &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as the correct reading are founded on the erroneous supposition that the subject treated of is the carrying away of the princes into exile; and that for the princes, in contrast with the young, no more suitable emblem could be chosen than the ram. But &#1512;&#1493;&#1491;&#1507; does not mean "the driver," him who leads or drives the captives into exile, but "the pursuer," who runs after the fugitive and seeks to catch him. The words treat of the capture of the princes: the flight of the king and his princes at the taking of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a>.) hovered before the writer's mind. For such a subject, the comparison of the fugitive princes to starved or badly fed rams is inappropriate; but it is suitable enough to compare them with harts which had lost all power to run, because they had been unable to find any pasture, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1495; (without strength, i.e., in weakness) are pursued and caught.</body></html>
