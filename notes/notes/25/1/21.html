Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?

The second and third lines are metrically irregular, as failing to fulfil the conditions of the “limping rhythm” of the Ḳinah. (See Intr. p. 321 f.)

The Hebrew has, "Thou hast brought;" it is the perfect of prophetic certitude, which represents an event certainly foreseen as if it had already taken place.

S. 94). This meaning is not confirmed for the Piel by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, <a href="/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>. &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; does not mean to summon an assembly, i.e., the multitude of foes (Raschi, Rosenmller, Gesenius, Neumann), but to proclaim a festival (cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>), because in <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a> and <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>) &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; denotes the feast-day, and in <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a> &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  means to proclaim a day. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; means "against me;" for those invited to the feast are the nations that God has invited to destroy the youths, i.e., the young troops of Jerusalem. These celebrate a feast like that of the vintage, at which Jahveh treads the wine-press for the daughter of Judah, because her young men are cut off like clusters of grapes (<a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>), and thrown into the wine-press (<a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>).
