Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?

"Out from the height (i.e., down from heaven) hath He sent fire into my bones;" &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is rendered by Luther, "and let it have the mastery" (Ger. und dasselbige walten lassen). Thenius explains this as being correct, and accordingly seeks to point the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, while Ewald takes &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; to be cognate with &#1512;&#1514;&#1495;, and translates it "made them red-hot;" and Rosenmller, following N. G. Schrder, attributes to &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, from the Arabic, the meaning collisit, percussit lapide. All these explanations are not only far-fetched and incapable of lexical vindication, but also unnecessary. The change of vowels, so as to make it the Hiphil, is opposed by the fact that &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, in the Hiphil, does not mean to cause to manage, rule, but to read down, subdue (<a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>).  In Kal, it means to tread, tread down, and rule, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>, where Gesenius and Deitrich erroneously assume the meaning of "striding, going," and accordingly render this passage, "it stalks through them." The lexically substantiated meaning, "subdue, rule, govern, (or, more generally,) overpower," is quite sufficient for the present passage, since &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; is construed not merely with &#1489;&#1468;, but also with the accusative: the subject is &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, which is also construed as a masc. in <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>; and the suffix &#1470;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; may either be taken as a neuter, or referred to "my bones," without compelling us to explain it as meaning unumquodque os (Rosenmller, etc.). The bones are regarded as bodily organs in which the pain is most felt, and are not to be explained away allegorically to mean urbes meas munitas (Chaldee). While fire from above penetrated the bones, God from beneath placed nets for the feet which thus were caught. On this figure, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a>, etc. The consequence of this was that "He turned me back," ita ut progredi pedemque extricare non possem, sed capta detinerer (C. B. Michaelis), - not, "he threw me down backwards," i.e., made me fall heavily (Thenius). "He hath made me desolate" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;), - not obstupescentem, perturbatam, desperatam (Rosenmller); the same word is applied to Tamar, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-20.htm">2 Samuel 13:20</a>, as one whose happiness in life has been destroyed. "The whole day (i.e., constantly, uninterruptedly) sick," or ill. The city is regarded as a person whose happiness in life has been destroyed, and whose health has been broken. This miserable condition is represented in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>, under another figure, as a yoke laid by God on this people for their sins. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1491;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., is explained by Kimchi as &#1504;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493; &#1504;&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, compactum vel colligatum, according to which &#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1491; would be allied to &#1506;&#1511;&#1491;. This explanation suits the context; on the other hand, neither the interpretation based on the Talmudic &#1505;&#1511;&#1491;, punxit, stimulavit, which is given by Raschi and Aben Ezra, nor the interpretations of the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate, which are founded on the reading &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, harmonize with &#1506;&#1500;, which must be retained, as is shown by the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;. Ewald supposes that &#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1491; was the technical expression for the harnessing on of the yoke. "The yoke of my transgressions" (not "of my chastisements," as Gesenius, Rosenmller, and Ewald think) means the yoke formed of the sins. The notion of punishment is not contained in &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;, but in the imposition of the yoke upon the neck, by which the misdeeds of sinful Jerusalem are laid on her, as a heavy, depressing burden which she must bear. These sins become interwoven or intertwine themselves (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;), after the manner of intertwined vine-tendrils (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>; cf. remarks on <a href="/job/40-17.htm">Job 40:17</a>), as the Chaldee paraphrase well shows; and, through this interweaving, form the yoke that has come on the neck of the sinful city. Veluti ex contortis funibus aut complicatis lignis jugum quoddam construitur, ita h. l. praevaricationis tanquam materia insupportabilis jugi considerantur (C. B. Michaelis). &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used of the imposition of the yoke, as in <a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>. The effect of the imposition of this yoke is: "it hath made my strength to stumble (fail)." Pareau, Thenius, Vaihinger, and Ngelsbach assume God as the subject of the verb &#1492;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;; but this neither accords with the current of the description, nor with the emphatic mention of the subject &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; in the clause succeeding this. Inasmuch as, in the first member of the verse, God is not the subject, but the address takes a passive turn, it is only the leading word &#1506;&#1500; that can be the subject of &#1492;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;: the yoke of sins which, twined together, have come on the neck, has made the strength stumble, i.e., broken it. This effect of the yoke of sins is stated, in the last member, in simple and unfigurative speech: "the Lord hath given me into the hands of those whom I cannot withstand," i.e., before whom I cannot maintain my ground. On the construction &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, cf. Ewald, 333, b; Gesenius, 116, 3. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is here viewed in the sense of standing fast, maintaining ground, as in <a href="/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a>; and, construed with the accusative, it signifies, to withstand any one; its meaning is not surgere, which Thenius, following the Vulgate, would prefer: the construction here requires the active meaning of the verb.</body></html>
