at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her princes ... - Jeremiah had before his mind the sad flight of Zedekiah and his men of war, and their capture within a few miles of Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. beauty &#8230; departed&#8212;her temple, throne, and priesthood.<p>harts that find no pasture&#8212;an animal timid and fleet, especially when seeking and not able to "find pasture."<p>Zain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> All the inhabitants of Zion have lost their former beauty; whatsoever splendour the city had, whether from the multitude or gallantry of her inhabitants, it is all gone; her nobles are become thin and ill-favoured, like beasts almost starved, their enemies pursue them to destroy them, and they have no strength to oppose or resist them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/lamentations/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed,....

The difference of date, "on the twenty-fifth of the month" (<a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), and "on the twenty-seventh of the month" in 2 Kings, has arisen through the entrance of a clerical error into one text or the other. The few remaining variations of the two texts have no influence on the meaning. As to the fact itself, and its importance for the people languishing in exile, we may refer to the explanation given at <a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>. </body></html>
