In fact, what is a “gift” in its source, is “effectual working” in its actual nature. On the phrase “effectual working of power”—a divine force in the soul, not latent but energetic—see <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>. In the whole of this passage, however, the chief emphasis is laid, not on the spiritual power, but on the freedom of God’s gift to the Apostle of this high privilege of preaching the mystery of the gospel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereof I was made a minister - see the notes at <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>.<p>According to the gift of the grace of God - It was not by my own seeking or merit; it was a free gift.<p>Of the grace of God - The sentiment is, that throughout it was a mere matter of grace that he was called into the ministry, and that so important an office was entrusted to him as that of bearing the gospel to the Gentiles.<p>By the effectual working of his power - Not by any native inclination which I had to the gospel, and not by any power which I have put forth. It is by "the energy of his power;" compare notes, <a href="/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>. Locke understands this of the energy or power which God put forth in converting the Gentiles under his ministry. But it seems to me that it refers rather to the power which God put forth in the conversion of Paul himself, and putting him into the ministry. This is clear from the following verse. The meaning is, that such was his opposition to the gospel by nature, that nothing but the "energy of God" could overcome it, and that his conversion was to be traced to that alone. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The less usual form <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθην</span>, however, is given by [243] [244] [245] [246], 17, etc., and is to be preferred.

Observe the recognition, at once restful and energizing, that the actual movements of the power of God were the force behind all his apostolic activity. “By Him he moves, in Him he lives.” Cp. besides <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm" title=" Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.">Colossians 1:29</a> just cited, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

Which was given me according to the working of his power. This denotes the manner of the gift; the gift itself, apostleship to the Gentiles, would have been little had it not been accompanied with Divine power. Spiritual office without spiritual power is miserable; but in Paul's case there was the power as well as the office; not merely the power of working miracles, as some have held, but besides this, the power of spiritual insight into the meaning of Scripture - power of exposition, power of demonstration, power of persuasion (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>, etc.).
