(See this idea more fully worked out in <a href="/context/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Philippians 1:12-29</a>.) “To faint” (as in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="But you, brothers, be not weary in well doing.">2Thessalonians 3:13</a>) is “to play the coward,” as “thinking it (see <a href="/context/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12-13</a>) a strange thing” that trouble should fall on him or them. It might well seem strange, when for four years at least, at Cæsarea and Rome, the marvellous activity of St. Paul’s Apostolic career was apparently cut short.<p><span class= "bld">At my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</span>—There is a peculiar beauty in the thought suggested by the words “which is your glory.” The suffering, triumphantly borne and actually turned to the furtherance of the gospel, is certainly a “glory,” in the proof which it gives of the power of the truth and the grace of Christ. But the more obvious idea would have been to comfort the Ephesians by the declaration that St. Paul’s tribulations were to himself a cause, not of pain, but of joy and glory—as is, in fact, done in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, and in the celebrated passage, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23-31</a>. Here, however, instead of so doing, St. Paul pursues the same line of thought as in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.">1Corinthians 4:10</a>—there half ironically, here seriously—that, while the suffering falls on himself, the glory passes to the Church, for which he suffers, and in which he is content to sink himself. Hence he bids the Ephesians find encouragement and glory for themselves, instead of a cause for “fainting,” in the afflictions endured on their behalf and overcome in Christ. As he identifies himself with them, so he would have them take what might be his glory to be their own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory....">Ephesians 3:13-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— Since by my ministry you have been called to the fellowship of the gospel; <span class="ital">I desire that ye faint not </span>— Be not discouraged or disheartened; <span class="ital">at my tribulations for </span>preaching the gospel to <span class="ital">you, which is your glory </span>— A cause of glorying and rejoicing to you, inasmuch as hereby it appears how much God regards you, in that he not only sends his apostles to preach the gospel to you, but to do this notwithstanding the great variety of extreme sufferings to which they are hereby exposed. <span class="ital">For this cause </span>— That ye may not faint, either on account of my sufferings or your own, and that the great work in which I am engaged may more successfully be carried on, and the purposes of these my sufferings maybe answered in your consolation and the divine glory; <span class="ital">I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— I present my sincere and ardent supplications before him.

He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not - The connection here is this. Paul was then a prisoner at Rome. He had been made such in consequence of his efforts to diffuse the Christian religion among the Gentiles; see the notes at <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>. His zeal in this cause, and the opinions which he held on this subject, had roused the wrath of the Jews, and led to all the calamities which he was now suffering. Of that the Ephesians. he supposes, were aware. It was natural that they should be distressed at his sufferings, for all his privations were endured on their account. But here he tells them not to be troubled and disheartened. He was indeed suffering; but he was reconciled to it, and they should be also, since it was promoting their welfare. The word rendered "faint" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  egkakeo&#772; - means literally, to turn out "a coward," or to lose one's courage; then to be fainthearted, etc.; notes, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>. It is rendered "faint" in <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>, and "weary" in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>. It does not elsewhere occur. It is rendered here by Locke "dismayed." Koppe supposes it means that they should not suppose that the Christian religion was vain and false because he was suffering so much from his countrymen on account of it. But it rather means that they might be in danger of being discouraged by the fact that "he" was enduring so much. They might become disheartened in their attachment to a system of religion which exposed its friends to such calamities. Paul tells them that this ought not to follow. They were to be profited by all his sufferings, and they should, therefore, hold fast to a religion which was attended with so many benefits to them - though he should suffer.<p>Which is your glory - Which tends to your honor and welfare. You have occasion to rejoice that you have a friend who is willing thus to suffer for you; you have occasion to rejoice in all the benefits which will result to you from, his trials in your behalf. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The <span class="ital">usual</span> reference is the <span class="ital">right</span> one; the <span class="ital">sufferings</span> of the apostle for the readers were <span class="ital">a glory of the latter</span>, it redounded to their <span class="ital">honour</span> that he suffered for them,[181] and this relation could not but raise them far above the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκακεῖν</span>, else they would not have accorded with the thought brought to their consciousness by the <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶ δόξα ὑμῶν</span>. The referring of <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> to <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐκκακεῖν</span> is inconsistent with the correct explanation of the latter (see above); for if Paul had said that it was glorious for the readers <span class="ital">not to grow faint</span>, he would either have given expression to a very <span class="ital">general</span> and <span class="ital">commonplace</span> thought, or else to one of which the specific contents must first be <span class="ital">mentally supplied</span> (gloria <span class="ital">spiritualis</span>); whereas <span class="ital">the</span> proposition: “<span class="ital">my tribulations are your glory</span>,” is in a high degree appropriate alike to the ingenious mode of expression, and to the apostolic sense of personal dignity, in which is implied a <span class="ital">holy pride</span>. Comp. <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[180] Harless finds, with Rhenferd (in Wolf), the connection: “ut <span class="ital">Proverbs se</span> primum, tum <span class="ital">Proverbs Ephesiis</span> oret.” But this change of the persons would have needed to be <span class="ital">indicated</span> by emphatic pronouns, if it were not to be looked upon as imported.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[181] This assertion stands in correct connection with his high apostolic position. That the apostle as <span class="greekheb">δέσμιος τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> suffered for the Gentile-Christians, could only redound to the honour of the latter, inasmuch as they could not but appear of the higher value, the more he did not refuse to undergo afflictions for them. This we remark in opposition not only to Rückert, who finds it most advisable to leave the contents of the clause indefinite, in order not to deprive it of its <span class="ital">oratorical</span> significance, but also in opposition to Harless and Olshausen, who are of opinion that the sufferings of the apostle could not in themselves be any glory for the Gentile-Christians. They are so on account of the <span class="ital">dignity of the sufferer</span>, and of his <span class="ital">relation</span> to those <span class="ital">for whose sake</span> he suffered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὸ αἰτοῦμαι μὴ ἐγκακεῖν ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσί μου ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">wherefore I ask that ye lose not heart in my tribulations in your behalf</span>. The <span class="greekheb">διό</span> is referred by some (Mey., etc.) to the immediately preceding verse, the possession of these great privileges of “boldness and access” on the part of the Ephesians being Paul’s reason for urging on them the request which follows. It is better, however, to refer the <span class="greekheb">διό</span> to the great thought of the whole paragraph, to which the statement in <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a> is subordinate, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the dignity of the office committed to Paul and its significance for them. Because the great trust of the Apostleship among the Gentiles is what he has declared it to be for himself and for them, he puts this request before them. The <span class="greekheb">αἰτεῖν</span>, which sometimes expresses a <span class="ital">demand</span> (<a href="/luke/1-63.htm" title="And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all.">Luke 1:63</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>), has the simple sense of <span class="ital">asking</span> here; and in such connections as the present <span class="greekheb">αἰτοῦμαι</span> has the full sense of asking <span class="ital">for one’s self</span>. It is followed sometimes by the acc. and inf. (<a href="/luke/23-23.htm" title="And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.">Luke 23:23</a>; <a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>), and sometimes, as here, by the simple inf. (<a href="/acts/7-46.htm" title="Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.">Acts 7:46</a>). The idea in the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐγκακεῖν</span> is that of <span class="ital">losing courage, becoming faint of heart</span>. The form <span class="greekheb">ἐκκακεῖν</span>, which is given in the TR, appears in [309] [310]3[311] [312] [313], etc. It is doubtful, however, whether that form occurs anywhere in ordinary Greek. It may have had a place in popular, <span class="ital">oral</span> use. The <span class="ital">written</span> form was <span class="greekheb">ἐγκακεῖν</span>, and that form appears here in most of the best MSS. ([314] [315] [316] [317]1, etc.). Hence LTrRV adopt <span class="greekheb">ἐγκακεῖν</span>; TWH, <span class="greekheb">ἐνκακεῖν</span>. But what is the construction here? Some supply <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span>, and make the sense either (1) “I pray God that ye faint not,” or (2) “I pray God that I faint not”. But if the subject of the <span class="greekheb">αἰτοῦμαι</span> had been God, the <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span> could scarcely have been omitted, as there is nothing in the context clearly to suggest it. And that it is the <span class="ital">readers</span>, not Paul himself, whose possible faint-heartedness is referred to appears from the force of the <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶ δόξα ὑμῶν</span>. Paul himself rejoiced in his tribulations (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-5.htm" title="Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 12:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2 Corinthians 12:10</a> : <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, etc.), and a prayer in such circumstances as the present betraying any fear about himself would be utterly unlike him. But he might have cause enough to apprehend that these converts might not all view painful things as he did. Hence <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> is to be understood as the subject of <span class="greekheb">αἰτοῦμαι</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm" title="Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God.">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-19.htm" title="But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.">Hebrews 13:19</a>). The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> before <span class="greekheb">θλίψεσι</span> has the proper sense of <span class="ital">in</span> (not “at” as RV puts it), pointing to the circumstances, sphere, or relation <span class="ital">in</span> which the faint-heartedness ought not to show itself (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., pp. 482, 483, and Ell., <span class="ital">in loc.</span>). These <span class="greekheb">θλίψεις</span> were <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span> (the phrase <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span> going surely with the <span class="greekheb">θλίψεσί μου</span>, not with <span class="greekheb">αἰτοῦμαι</span> as Harless strangely puts it), as sufferings endured in virtue of Paul’s Apostleship among the Gentiles; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Php 1:17</a>. The defining article again is not required before <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span>, as the phrase makes in reality one idea.—<span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶ δόξα ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">which are your glory</span>. The distinction between the definite or objective rel. <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> and the indefinite, generic, or qualitative rel. <span class="greekheb">ὅστις</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Jelf, <span class="ital">Gr. Gram.</span>, 816) is not always maintained in the NT, and indeed the use of <span class="greekheb">ὅστις</span> for <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> is as old as Herod. (ii., 92) and Ionic Greek generally (Kühner, <span class="ital">Gr. Gram.</span>, ii., 906). In the Pauline Epistles, however, the distinction seems to be fairly maintained (Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 173), and <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> appears here to have the force of an <span class="ital">explanation</span>—“inasmuch as they are,” “for indeed they are”. The rel. is referred by some (Theod., Olsh., Harl.) to the <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐγκακεῖν</span>, or to the whole sentence beginning with that; in which case <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> would stand for <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>. But it is most naturally referred to the <span class="greekheb">θλίψεσι</span>. It is a case of attraction, but one in which the noun of the rel. clause gives its number (<span class="ital">cf. Dem. c. Aphob.</span>, p. 853, 31, and in the NT itself, <a href="/acts/24-11.htm" title="Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.">Acts 24:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>) as well as its gender to the rel. (Win.-Moult., p. 206; Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of NT Greek</span>, p. 281; Donald., <span class="ital">Gr. Gram.</span>, p. 362; Madvig, <span class="ital">Syn.</span>, § 98). The clause, therefore, gives the readers a reason or motive for not yielding to faintness of heart. Paul’s tribulations were endured in their behalf, and were of value for them. The greater the office of the sufferer, the more did the afflictions which he was content to endure for them redound to their honour; and the better this was understood by them, the less should they give way to weakness and discouragement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[309] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[310] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[311] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.

In the propagation of such a Gospel the messenger might well be willing to suffer for the sake of the converts; and they in their turn might well not be discouraged when they saw him suffer for them. These sufferings, far from indicating defeat or failure, were “their glory,” proofs that their Lord thought their incorporation into Himself <span class="ital">worth</span> the severest conflicts and sorrows of an Apostle. Yet the intense community of love between converts and Apostle might still tempt them to depression; and hence this request, so generous and tender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I desire</span>] I. e. probably, “I desire <span class="ital">you;</span> I ask as a boon from <span class="ital">you</span>.” It is possible to explain the words of a <span class="ital">prayer to God;</span> but the Gr. construction does not favour this, and the much stronger phrase for prayer <span class="ital">in the next verse</span> is also against it.
