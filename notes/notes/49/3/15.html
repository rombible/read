The translation is tempting, yielding a grand sense, and one thoroughly accordant with the treatment of the earthly relationship below (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>). But the usage of the word is clearly against it; and we must render it <span class= "ital">every family</span>—that is, every body of rational beings in earth or heaven united under one common fatherhood, and bearing the name (as in a family or clan) of the common ancestor. Such bodies are certainly the first germs or units of human society; what their heavenly counterparts may be, who can tell? The Apostle looks upon the fathers whose names they delight to bear as the imperfect representatives of God, and upon the family itself, with its head, as the type in miniature of the whole society of spiritual beings united in sonship to the Father in heaven. Hence he declares that it is ultimately from Him that every family derives the name of <span class= "ital">patria, </span>and by that very name bears witness to the Divine Fatherhood, on which he desires here to lay especial stress.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘THE WHOLE FAMILY’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ephesians/3-15.htm" title="Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,">Ephesians 3:15</a>Grammatically, we are driven to recognise that the Revised Version is more correct than the Authorised, when it reads ‘every family,’ instead of ‘the whole family.’ There is in the expression no reference to the thought, however true it is in itself, that the redeemed in heaven and the believers on earth make up but one family. The thought rather is, that, as has been said, ‘the father makes the family,’ and if any community of intelligent beings, human, or angelic, bears the great name of family, the great reason for that lies ‘in God’s paternal relationship.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But my present purpose in selecting this text is not so much to speak of it as to lay hold of the probably incorrect rendering in the Authorised Version, as suggesting, though here inaccurately, the thought that believers struggling here and saints and angels glorious above ‘but one communion make,’ and in the light of that thought, to consider the meaning of the Lord’s Supper. I am, of course, fully conscious that in thus using the words, I am diverting them from their original purpose; but possibly in this case, open confession, my open confession, may merit your forgiveness and at all events, it, in some degree, brings me my own.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Consider the Lord’s Supper as a sign that the Church on earth is a family.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Passover was essentially a family feast, and the Lord’s Supper, which was grafted on it, was plainly meant to be the same. The domestic character of the rite shines clearly out in the precious simplicity of the arrangements in the upper room. When Christ and the twelve sat down there, it was a family meal at which they sat. He was the head of the household; they were members of His family. The early examples of the rite, when the disciples ‘gathered together to break bread,’ obviously preserved the same familiar character, and stand in extraordinary contrast to the splendours of high mass in a Roman Catholic Cathedral. The Church, as a whole, is a household, and the very form of the rite proclaims that ‘we, being many, are one bread.’ The conception of a family brings clearly into view the deepest ground of Christian unity. It is the possession of a common life, just as men are born into an earthly family, not of their own will, nor of their own working, and come without any action of their own into bonds of blood relationship with brothers and sisters. When we become sons of God and are born again, we become brethren of all His children. That which gives us life in Him makes us kindred with all through whose veins flows that same life. It is the common partaking in the one bread which makes us one. The same blood flows in the veins of all the children.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hence, the only ground on which the Church rests is this common possession of the life of Christ, and that ground makes, and ought to be felt to make, Christian union a far deeper, more blessed, and more imperative bond than can be found in any shallow similarities of aim-or identities of opinion or feeling. The deepest fact of Christian consciousness is the foundation fact of Christian brotherhood; each is nearer to every Christian than to any besides. A very solemn view of Christian duty arises from these thoughts, familiar as they are:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘No distance breaks the tie of blood,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brothers are brothers ever more.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and every tongue is loud in condemnation of any man who is ashamed or afraid to recognise his brother and stand by him, whatever may be the difference in their worldly positions. ‘Every one who loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The Lord’s Supper as a prophecy of the family at home above.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prophetic character was stamped on the first institution of the Lord’s Supper by Christ’s own words ‘until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God,’ and by His declaration that He appointed unto them a kingdom, that they might eat and drink at His table in His kingdom. We may also recall the mysterious feast spread on the shore of the lake, where, with obvious allusion both to his earlier miracles and to the sad hour in the upper room, he came ‘and taketh the bread and gave it to them.’ Blending these two together we get most blessed, though dim, thoughts of that future; they speak to us of an eternal home, an eternal feast, and an eternal society. We have to reverse not a few of the characteristics of the upper room in order to reach those of the table in the kingdom. The Lord’s Supper was followed for Him by Gethsemane and Calvary, and for them by going out to betray and to deny and to forsake Him. From that better table there is no more going out. The servant comes in from the field, spent with toil and stained with many a splash, but the Master Himself comes forth and serves His servant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the eternal feast, which is spread above, the bread as well as the wine is new, even whilst it is old, for there will be disclosed new depths of blessing and power in the old Christ, and new draughts of joy and strength in the old wine which will make the feasters say, in rapture and astonishment, to the Master of the feast, ‘Thou hast kept the good wine until now.’ There and then all broken ties will be re-knit, all losses supplied, and no shadow of change, nor fear of exhaustion, pass across the calm hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>III. The Lord’s Supper is a token of the present union of the two.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If it thus prophesies the perfectness of heaven, it also shows us how the two communities of earth and heaven are united. They, as we, live by derivation of the one life; they, as we, are fed and blessed by the one Lord. The occupations and thoughts of Christian life on earth and of the perfect life of Saints above are one. They look to Christ as we do, when we live as Christians, though the sun which is the light of both regions shows there a broader disc, and pours forth more fervid rays, and is never obscured by clouds, nor ever sets in night. Whether conscious of us or not, they are doing there, in perfect fashion, what we imperfectly attempt, and partially accomplish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘The Saints on earth and all the Dead<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But one communion make.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Heaven and earth are equally mansions in the Father’s house.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To the faith which realises this great truth, death dwindles to a small matter. The Lord’s table has an upper and a lower level. Sitting at the lower, we may feel that those who have gone from our sides, and have left empty places which never can be filled, are gathered round Him in the upper half, and though a screen hangs between the two, yet the feast is one and the family is one. Singly our dear ones go, and singly we all shall go. The table spread in the presence of enemies will be left vacant to its last place, and the one spread above will be filled to its last place, and so shall we ever be with the Lord, and the unity which was always real be perfectly and permanently manifested at the last.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-19 The apostle seems to be more anxious lest the believers should be discouraged and faint upon his tribulations, than for what he himself had to bear. He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of whom the whole family - This expression "of whom," may refer either to "the Father," or to the Lord Jesus. Commentators have been divided in opinion in regard to it. Bloomfield, Chandler, Erasmus, Koppe, and some others, refer it to the Father. Locke, Doddridge, Calvin, and some others, refer it to the Lord Jesus. This is the more natural interpretation. The whole "family of God," means all his children; and the idea is, that they all bear the same name, derived from the Redeemer; all are Christians. No matter where they are, in heaven or in earth; no matter from what nation they are converted, whether Jews or Gentiles, they all have one name, and one Redeemer, and all belong to one family; see <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>.<p>In heaven - Spirits of just people made perfect. It does not properly refer to angels, for he is not speaking of them but of the family of the redeemed. If the phrase "in heaven," could "ever" be taken to denote the Jews as contradistinguished from the Gentiles, I should think that this was one of the places. Many expositors have supposed that it is frequently so used in this Epistle, but I see no clear evidence of it, and no instance where it seems very probable, unless this should be one. And it is not necessary here, for it may mean "all" the redeemed, whether in heaven or earth, though the connection would seem rather to have suggested a reference to the Jews and the Gentiles. An expression similar to this occurs in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>. "To reconcile all things to himself, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven." The passage before us is one that is commonly explained by a reference to Jewish opinions. The Jews were accustomed to call the angels in heaven God's "upper family," and his people on earth his "lower family." See the passages cited from the rabbinical writers in Wetstein.<p>Is named - This means substantially the same as is. They are all of one family. They all have one father, and are all of one community. The expression is taken from the custom in a family, where all bear the name of the "head" of the family; and the meaning is, that all in heaven and on earth are united under one head, and constitute one community. It does not mean that all are "called" by the same name, or that the name "Christian" is given to the angels, but that they all pertain to the same community, and constitute the same great and glorious brotherhood. Part are in heaven, near his throne; part in distant worlds; part are angels of light; part redeemed and happy spirits; part are in the church on earth; but they are all united as one family, and have one head and Father. This glorious family will yet be gathered together in heaven, and will encompass the throne of their common Father rejoicing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. the whole family&#8212;Alford, Middleton, and others translate, "every family": alluding to the several families in heaven and in earth supposed to exist [Theophylact, &AElig;cumenius, in Suicer, 2.633], the apostle thus being supposed to imply that God, in His relation of Father to us His adopted children, is the great prototype of the paternal relation wherever found. But the idea that "the holy angels are bound up in spiritual families or compaternities," is nowhere else in Scripture referred to. And Ac 2:36, where the article is similarly omitted, and yet the translation is, "All the house of Israel," shows that in New Testament Greek the translation is justifiable, "all the family," or "the whole family": which accords with Scripture views, that angels and men, the saints militant and those with God, are one holy family joined under the one Father in Christ, the mediator between heaven and earth (Eph 1:10; Php 2:10). Hence angels are termed our "brethren" (Re 19:10), and "sons of God" by creation, as we are by adoption (Job 38:7). The Church is part of the grand family, or kingdom, which comprehends, besides men, the higher spiritual world, where the archetype, to the realization of which redeemed man is now tending, is already realized. This universal idea of the "kingdom" of God as one divine community, is presented to us in the Lord's Prayer. By sin men were estranged, not only from God, but from that higher spiritual world in which the kingdom of God is already realized. As Christ when He reconciled men to God, united them to one another in a divine community (joined to Himself, the one Head), breaking down the partition wall between Jew and Gentile (Eph 2:14), so also He joins them in communion with all those who have already attained that perfection in the kingdom of God, to which the Church on earth is aspiring (Col 1:20) [Neander].<p>is named&#8212;derives its origin and its name as sons of God. To be named, and to be, are one with God. To bear God's name is to belong to God as His own peculiar people (Nu 6:27; Isa 43:7; 44:5; Ro 9:25, 26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of whom; </span> either of God, or rather of Christ, last mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The whole family, </span> or kindred, the church of God being his household, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In heaven and earth; </span> all the saints, both which are already in glory, and which yet live upon the earth, wherever or whoever they be, Jews or Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is named:</span> to be named, or called, implies the thing as well as the name, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a> <a href="/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a></span>.

The sense, therefore, is “the Father, from whom all the related orders of intelligent beings, human and angelic, each by itself, get the significant name of <span class="ital">family, community</span>”. The various classes of men on earth, Jewish, Gentile, and others, and the various orders of angels in heaven, are all related to God, the common Father, and only in virtue of that relation has any of them the name of <span class="ital">family</span>. The <span class="ital">father</span> makes the family; God is the Father of all; and if any community of intelligent beings, human or angelic, bears the great name of <span class="ital">family</span>, the reason for that lies in this relation of God to it. The significant name has its origin in the spiritual relationship. It is not possible, however, to give proper expression to the thought in English. In the Greek there is a play upon the words <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span>, which cannot be reproduced. Some have supposed that Paul has certain Rabbinical notions in view here, or that he is glancing at certain Gnostic theories, or at the vain worship of angels. But there is no ground for such far-fetched suppositions. The Rabbinical conceits regarding angels and the Gnostic speculations were both very different from anything suggested here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">of whom … is named</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">out of Whom</span>, &c.” The <span class="ital">derivation</span> of the “name” is from His Fatherhood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the whole family</span>] Gr., <span class="ital">patria</span>. It is difficult to preserve in English the point of the Gr. here. “Father” and “family” have no verbal kinship, while <span class="ital">patêr</span> and <span class="ital">patria</span> have. “The whole fatherhood,” or “every fatherhood,” would scarcely convey a clear idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An interesting question of interpretation arises here. The Revisers render “<span class="ital">every family</span>,” or (margin) “<span class="ital">every fatherhood</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> and in this they have the concurrence of many commentators, modern and ancient. Indeed, there could be no doubt of their rendering were the usages of Greek in the N. T. and in the classics the same; the absence here of the article before <span class="ital">patria</span> would be decisive in Xenophon, for example. But the law of the Gr. article is in some respects less precise in the N. T., as was observed on <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> (where see note); and we are at liberty here, as there, though of course with caution, to take the context into account, before surrendering the A. V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The alternatives then are, (1) to understand the Apostle to diverge to the thought that God’s spiritual Fatherhood is the Archetype of all family unions, in earth and heaven; the source from which every other “father” draws his “name,” his title and idea; (2) to understand the Apostle to dwell on the thought of the oneness of the family union of saints and angels under the Eternal Father of Spirits Who gives “name,” designation as His children, to the whole company.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We feel the difficulty of the question. And we are willing to own that there <span class="ital">may</span> be communities in the heavenly world to which the idea of family may attach. But if so this is the solitary hint of it in Scripture. And meanwhile the context as a whole seems to us to plead strongly for the idea of oneness as against particularity. And the phrase “in heaven and earth,” compared with <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a> (where carefully observe the connexion), suggests to us far rather the idea of the Great Family “gathered up” in Christ than the extraneous and new idea of many families, connected or not connected with Him. We plead accordingly for the A. V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And we thus see presented in the passage the great truth, so characteristic of the whole Epistle—the spiritual oneness of the holy Community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is worth observing that the word “family” was used by the Rabbis in a sense somewhat akin to the sense (thus explained) of this passage. With them “the upper family” and “the lower family” meant, respectively, the Angels and Israel. Wetstein here quotes a Rabbinic comment on <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm" title="Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?">Jeremiah 30:6</a> :—“<span class="ital">All faces;</span> even the faces of the upper and lower family; of the angels and of Israel.” And again; “God does nothing without counsel taken with His upper family.” This is not a perfect parallel here, where, as we take it, the idea is strictly of one united brotherhood; but it is near enough to have had, possibly, a share in moulding the phrase here.—The suggestion to translate the Greek, “the whole family in heaven, and that on earth,” oversteps, we think, the limits of the grammar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-15.htm" title="Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,">Ephesians 3:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξ οὗ</span>) <span class="ital">of Whom</span>, viz. the Father of Jesus Christ.

But as in <a href="/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>; <a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>; <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.36; 7:22, and <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; so here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> without the article may denote the totality of the thing; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> corresponding <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>. And this seems more in accord with the scope of the passage, for here the apostle is not distributing into groups, but gathering into one. But what is the precise import of the statement, and for what reason is it introduced? The apostle recognizes all saints, whether in heaven or on earth, as forming one family, and as the whole family derives its name from God, so God may ha expected and appealed to to make full and corresponding provision for the wants of its various sections. The implied appeal is not to the fact that the family is God's family, but to the fact, less important in itself but really including the other, that it is named after him. Among men, one would be held emphatically bound to take an interest in those who are not only his relations but bear his very name. Now, that part of the family which is housed in heaven is gloriously provided for; the apostle proceeds to intercede for the portion still on earth. As the whole family is named after the same Father, is conspicuous before the eyes of all as God's, so it may well be expected that the more needy, feeble, exposed, and tempted part of the family will be treated in every way worthy of its Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Let saints on earth unite to sing<br />With those to glory gone;<br />For all the servants of our King,<br />In earth and heaven, are one.<br />"One family we dwell in him,<br />One Church above, beneath;<br />Though now divided by the stream,<br />The narrow stream, of death."</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of whom (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;)<p>After whom.<p>The whole family (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;)<p>Rev., more correctly, every family. &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; is, more properly, a group of families - all who claim a common &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;. father. Family, according to our usage of the term, would be &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; house. The Israelites were divided into tribes (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;), and then into &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, each deriving its descent from one of Jacob's grandsons; and these again into &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; houses. So Joseph was both of the house (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) and family (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;) of David. We find the phrase &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; houses of the families, <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>. The word occurs only three times in the New Testament: here, <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>. In the last-named passage it is used in a wide, general sense, of nations. Family is perhaps the best translation, if taken in its wider meaning of a body belonging to a common stock - a clan. Fatherhood (Rev., in margin), following the Vulgate paternitas, means rather the fact and quality of paternity. Observe the play of the words, which can scarcely be reproduced in English, pater, patria.<p>In heaven and earth<p>To the angelic hosts and the tribes of men alike, God is Father. There may be a suggestion of the different ranks or grades of angels, as principalities, thrones, powers, etc. See <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>. "Wherever in heaven or in earth beings are grouped from their relation to a father, the name they bear in each case is derived from the Father" (Riddle). </body></html>
