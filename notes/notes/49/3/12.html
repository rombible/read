Probably here it is suggested in its original sense by the reference in the preceding verse to the charge of proclaiming the mystery of God, and accordingly means that boldness of thought and utterance before men and angels which Christians, in virtue of that charge, ought to assume. The “access (see <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) in confidence” is, on the other hand, that confidence before God, as presented to Him in the Lord Jesus Christ, which belongs to Christians as no longer servants but sons. (On this confidence see <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-4.htm" title="And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:">2Corinthians 3:4-6</a>.) Both these gifts depend on “faith in Him:” in the one case, faith in His teaching and grace; in the other, faith in His atonement and His gift of the new life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-12 Those whom God advances to honourable employments, he makes low in their own eyes; and where God gives grace to be humble, there he gives all other needful grace. How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have boldness - The word used here - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  parre&#772;sian - means, properly, boldness of speaking; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>; <a href="/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>, <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>.

The second <span class="greekheb">τήν</span>, which is inserted by the TR, has the support of some good authorities, [301] [302]3 [303] [304] [305], Chrys., etc.; but is not found in [306] [307] [308] 17, etc., and is to be omitted (with LTTrWHRV). As the <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> and the <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγή</span> meet in one idea the <span class="greekheb">τήν</span> does not require to be repeated.

The conjunction of the <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγή</span> with the intrans. <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> makes the intrans. sense of <span class="ital">access</span> more appropriate here than the trans. sense of <span class="ital">introduction; cf.</span> under <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πεποιθήσει</span>: <span class="ital">in confidence</span>.

In the LXX it occurs once (<a href="/2_kings/18-19.htm" title="And Rabshakeh said to them, Speak you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?">2 Kings 18:19</a>); in the NT it is found only in Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2 Corinthians 1:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-4.htm" title="And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:">2 Corinthians 3:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-4.htm" title="Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.

It indicates the disposition in which the <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> and <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγή</span> are made good.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">through our faith in Him</span>. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is best taken as the <span class="ital">gen. objecti; cf.</span> <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>.

It was “purposed in Him” that we His saints should be unspeakably near to the Father; and so we now <span class="ital">are</span>, and angels see it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">boldness</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">the</span> (or <span class="bld">our</span>) <span class="bld">freedom of speech</span>, the boldness of intimate <span class="ital">intercourse</span>. Here and there (perhaps <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, where A. V. “openly”; <a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>; where A. V. “confidence”) the original word seems to lose its special reference to speech; but certainly not here. The saint (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>) “comes with <span class="ital">free utterance</span> to the throne of grace”; to <span class="ital">speak</span> a child’s every thought, desire, and fear.—On the definite article here (“<span class="ital">the</span> boldness”) Monod remarks that it indicates “une hardiesse <span class="ital">bien connue</span>”, a familiar characteristic of experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">access</span>] Better, <span class="bld">introduction</span>; see on <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with confidence</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">in</span>. This holy confidence with God is illustrated often in the Acts, and in the Epistles. Meyer refers to <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a> &c. Still more in point is the passage just following this, and St Paul’s other prayers for his converts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the faith of him</span>] So lit, but the better English equivalent for the Greek is (R. V.) <span class="bld">through our faith in Him</span>. The same construction with the same meaning occurs <a href="/mark/11-22.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.">Mark 11:22</a> (“have faith <span class="ital">of</span> God”); <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>. See too <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> (“faith <span class="ital">of</span> the operation of God”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the persistent recurrence of the idea of faith. The entrance into one-ness with Christ is, on our side, by faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>), and (here) the life lived in that sacred one-ness is realized in the exercise of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὴν παῤῥησίαν</span>, <span class="ital">liberty</span>) <span class="ital">of the mouth</span>, in praying.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν προσαγωγὴν ἐν πεποιθήσει</span>, <span class="ital">access, admission in confidence</span>) in reality and with the heart.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom we have our boldness and access.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> literally means "boldness" or "freedom <span class="accented">of speech</span>," but is used here in a more ample sense for want of restraint, ease of feeling, comfortable self-possession, in our access to God. Contrast with Adam hiding himself among the trees of the garden, and the lost calling on the mountains to fall on them, and the rocks to cover them. The "we" in this verse includes both Jews and Gentiles. The "access," or introduction (see <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>), is like that of the high priest into the holy of holies - we have boldness to enter into the holiest of all (<span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 10:19). <span class="cmt_word">In confidence through the faith of him.</span> The confidence of being welcomed and accepted when we go into God's presence springs from our faith in him. We believe in him as the Propitiation, as our Peace, as the Reconciler, and we go before God with confidence. The clause, "through faith in him," influences the whole verse. And, as before, we have at the beginning of the verse, "in whom"  - an express-ion denoting generally our union with Christ, and at the end, "through the faith of him" - a specification of the instrument by which flint union is formed and by which it operates. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Faith of Him (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>As often, for faith in Him. </body></html>
