All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereby, when ye read - By the bare reading of which you may understand the view which I entertain of the plan of salvation, and the knowledge which I have of God's method of saving people, particularly of his intention in regard to the salvation of the Gentiles.<p>In the mystery of Christ - This does not refer to anything "mysterious" in the person of Christ; or the union of the divine and human nature in him; or to anything difficult of apprehension in the work of the atonement. It means the hitherto concealed doctrine that through the Messiah, the Gentiles were to be received to the same privileges as the Jews, and that the plan of salvation was to be made equally free for all. This great truth had been hitherto concealed, or but partially understood, and Paul says that he was appointed to make it known to the world. His "knowledge" on the subject, he says, could be understood by what he had said, and from that they could judge whether he was qualified to state and defend the doctrines of the gospel. Paul evidently supposed that the knowledge which he had on that subject was of eminent value; that it was possessed by few; that it was important to understand it. Hence he dwells upon it. He speaks of the glory of that truth. He traces it back to the counsels of God. He shows that it entered into his eternal plans; and he evidently felt that the truth which he had communicated in the former part of this Epistle, was among the most important that could come before the mind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. understand my knowledge&#8212;"perceive my understanding" [Alford], or "intelligence."

But here precisely the point brought into prominence, that the mystery had become known to him <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν</span>, justifies the stress laid upon his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΎΝΕΣΙς</span></span></span> in the mystery, so far as he has already manifested the same in his Epistle.

Hardly would another, who had merely assumed the name of the apostle Paul, have put into his mouth such a self-display of his <span class="greekheb">σύνεσις</span>—which, in order not to fall out of his assumed apostolic part, he would rather have avoided.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΎΝΕΣΙς</span></span></span>, see on <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[168] Wiggers (<span class="ital">Stud. u.

As the <span class="greekheb">σύνεσίν μου ἐν τῶ</span>. etc., makes one idea, the article is dispensed with after the prep.
