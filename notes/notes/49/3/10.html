which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>) as “desiring to look into” the consummation of the gospel mystery. In the same sense the Apostles, in their ministration of the gospel, are said to be a spectacle to angels and to men (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1Corinthians 4:9</a>); and in a magnificent passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>), Christians are encouraged in their warfare by knowing it to go on before “the city of the living God” and “an innumerable company of angels.” The angels are, therefore, represented to us as not only ministering in the Church of Christ, but learning from its existence and fortunes to know more and more of the wisdom of God. Hence we gain a glimpse of a more than world-wide purpose in the supreme manifestation of God’s mercy in Christ, fulfilled towards higher orders of God’s rational creatures, aiding even them in progress towards the knowledge of God in Jesus Christ, which is life eternal. (There is a notable passage on a kindred idea in Butler’s <span class= "ital">Analogy, </span>Part i., c. Iii. § 5.) This world, itself a speck in the universe, may be—perhaps as a scene of exceptional rebellion against God, certainly as a scene of God’s infinite goodness—a lesson to other spheres of being, far beyond our conception. Possibly this view of angels as our fellow-learners in the school of Christ may have been specially dwelt upon in view of the worship of angels of which we read in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>; but it accords well with the wide sweep of thought characteristic of this Epistle, literally “gathering up all things in Christ.”<p><span class= "bld">The manifold wisdom.</span>—The word “manifold” (properly, <span class= "ital">many-coloured, </span>or <span class= "ital">wrought in many details</span>) is used here (and nowhere else) for the wisdom of God, as “fulfilling itself in many ways” (the “sundry times and divers manners” of <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>). It is manifested, therefore, in the infinite variety both of the teaching and the life of the Church—manifold, yet one, as embodying but one life, the life of Jesus Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,...">Ephesians 3:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">To the intent that now </span>— Under the gospel dispensation, the last and best dispensation of divine grace and mercy to fallen man; <span class="ital">unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places </span>— To all the various orders of angelic beings; <span class="ital">might be </span>made <span class="ital">known by the church </span>— Namely, by what is done in and for it; <span class="ital">the manifold wisdom of God — </span>Discovering itself gradually in such a beautiful and well-ordered variety of dispensations.

How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the intent - Greek, "that" &#x399;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  Hina. The sense is, that it was with this design, or that this was the purpose for which all things were made. One grand purpose in the creation of the universe was, that the wisdom of God might be clearly shown by the church. It was not enough to evince it by the formation of the sun, the stars, the earth, the seas, the mountains, the floods. It was not enough to show it by the creation of intelligent beings, the formation of immortal minds on earth, and the various ranks of the angelic world. There were views of the divine character which could be obtained only in connection with the redemption of the world. Hence the universe was created, and man was made upon the earth, not merely to illustrate the divine perfections in the work of creation, but in a still more illustrious manner in the work of redemption. And hence the deep interest which the angelic hosts have ever evinced in the salvation of man.<p>That now - the word "now" - &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;  nun - is missing in the Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic; and is omitted by many of the fathers; see Koppe. If it is to be retained, it means that this display is to be made under the gospel. "Now, since the Messiah is come; now, under the Christian dispensation, this revelation is to be made to distant worlds."<p>Unto the principalities and powers - To the angelic hosts - the intelligent beings that surround the throne of God; see the notes at <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>.<p>By the church - By the incarnation of the Redeemer to save it; by I the mercy shown to it; by the wise arrangement made to recover his people from the fall; and by all the graces and beauties which that redeemed church will evince on earth and in heaven.<p>The manifold wisdom of God - Literally, "much-variegated." It means the "greatly-diversified wisdom." It does not mean merely that there was "great" wisdom, but that the wisdom shown was diversified and varied; like changing, Variegated colors. There was a "beautiful and well-ordered variety of dispensations" toward that church, all of which tended to evince the wisdom of God. It is like a landscape, or a panoramic view passing before the mind, with a great variety of phases and aspects, all tending to excite admiration. In the redemption of the church, there is not merely one form or one phase of wisdom. It is wisdom, ever-varying, ever-beautiful. There was wisdom manifested when the plan was formed; wisdom in the selection of the Redeemer; wisdom in the incarnation; wisdom in the atonement; wisdom in the means of renewing the heart, and sanctifying the soul; wisdom in the various dispensations by which the church is sanctified, guided, and brought to glory. The wisdom thus shown is like the ever-varying beauty of changing clouds, when the sun is reflected on them at evening. Each aspect is full of beauty. One bright; cloud differs in appearance from others; yet all tend to fill the mind with elevated views of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Secondarily, God's wisdom in redemption is made known to evil angels, who dwell "in heavenly places" in a lower sense, namely, the air (compare Eph 2:2 with Eph 6:12); "known" to their dismay (1Co 15:24; Col 2:15).<p>might be known&#8212;Translate, "may be known."<p>by the church&#8212;"by means of," or "through the Church," which is the "theater" for the display of God's manifold wisdom (Lu 15:10; 1Co 4:9): "a spectacle (Greek, 'theater') to angels." Hence, angels are but our "fellow servants" (Re 19:10).<p>manifold wisdom&#8212;though essentially one, as Christ is one, yet varying the economy in respect to places, times, and persons (Isa 55:8, 9; Heb 1:1). Compare 1Pe 4:10, "stewards of the manifold grace of God." Man cannot understand aright its single acts till he can survey them as a connected whole (1Co 13:12).

The Divine wisdom is in itself one simple thing, but appearing in so great variety of works, it is said to be various. This may be best understood of the whole economy of men’s redemption, and God’s governing his church in several ages, the several forms of the church, the various ways of revealing the Divine will, the different measures of light let out in different times, the different dispensations of the covenant of grace before the law, under the law, under the gospel, to the Jews, to the Gentiles, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ephesians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places,....

And it may be called "manifold", because of its various doctrines and promises and because of the various instances of wisdom in them, and the various persons to whom it is made known, and the various times in which it is displayed: and now under the Gospel this is more clearly known, or made known to the angels by the church of God, through the ministry of the word in it, on which angels attend, being desirous to look more diligently into the mysteries of it; and by the displays of the wisdom and grace of God unto his church and people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <i>places</i> might be known by the church the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> manifold wisdom of God,</span><p>(2) The unsuspected calling of the Gentiles was as it were a mirror to the heavenly angels, in which they might behold the marvellous wisdom of God.<p>(c) God always had only one way to save men by: but it had various shapes and forms.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span>] not <span class="ital">ecbatic</span> (Thomas, Boyd, Zanchius, Estius, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Meier, Holzhausen), introduces the <span class="ital">design</span>, not, however, of <span class="greekheb">τῷ τὰ πάντα κτίσαντι</span>, as, in addition to those who understand <span class="greekheb">κτίσ</span>. of the ethical creation, also Harless would take it.[178] The latter sees in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῷ ΤᾺ ΠΆΝΤΑ ΚΤΊΣΑΝΤΙ ἽΝΑ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> an explanation “how the plan of redemption had been from all ages hidden in God; <span class="ital">inasmuch as it was He who created the world, in order to reveal in the church of Christ the manifoldness of His wisdom</span>.” But the very doctrine itself, that the design of God in the creation of the world was directed to the making known of His wisdom <span class="ital">to the angels</span>, and <span class="ital">by means of the Christian church</span>, has nowhere an analogy in the N.T.; according to <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, <span class="ital">Christ</span> (the personal Christ Himself) is the aim of the creation of all things, <span class="ital">even of the angels</span>, who are here included in <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>.

T</span>. 1149; Eubul. in Athen. xv. p. 679 D; Orph. v. 11, lx. 4. It signifies <span class="ital">much-manifold</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in a high degree manifold, quite corresponding to the Latin <span class="ital">multivarius.</span> That it signifies <span class="ital">very wise</span> (Wolf, Koppe, Rosenmüller) has been erroneously assumed from Aesch. <span class="ital">Prom</span>. 1308, where <span class="greekheb">ποίκιλος</span> means <span class="ital">crafty</span>. As <span class="greekheb">πολυποίκιλος</span>, the wisdom of God manifests itself to the angels through the church, inasmuch as the counsel of the redemption of the world is therein presented to them in its universal realization, and they thus behold the manifold ways and measures of God, which He had hitherto taken with reference to the Jews and Gentiles, all now in their connection with the institute of redemption,—all uniting in this as their goal. The church is thus for them, as regards the manifold wisdom of God, the <span class="ital">central fact of revelation</span>; for the <span class="greekheb">πολυποικίλους ὁδοὺς Θεοῦ</span>, which they before knew not as to their ultimate end, but only in and by themselves (and how diverse were these ways with the Jews and with the Gentiles!), they now see in point of fact, through the church (“haec enim operum divinorum theatrum est,” Bengel), as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΥΠΟΊΚΙΛΟς ΣΟΦΊΑ</span></span></span>. Thus by the appearing of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΚΛΗΣΊΑ</span></span></span> as a fact in the history of salvation, the wisdom of the divine government of the world has been on every side unveiled and brought to recognition. Entirely without warrant, Baur assumes, p. 429, that the <span class="ital">Gnostic</span> <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>, with its heterogeneous forms and conditions (comp. Iren. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. i. 4. 1), was present to the mind of the writer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[178] So also Baur refers it, p. 425, but explains the thus resulting aim of the creation from the doctrine of the Valentinians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] The whole apprehension of our passage by Matthies is mistaken. He refers <span class="greekheb">τῷ τὰ πάντα κτίσ</span>. to all that God has either created in the natural reference of the term, or accomplished in a spiritual respect for the salvation of men. According to his view, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> applies to <span class="greekheb">τῷ τὰ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">κτίσ</span>.; the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ καὶ ἐξουσίαι</span> are “the high and mighty ones who live in the world, or even in an invisible spiritual manner play their part in the same;” <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span> is to be taken “as the actually subsisting aggregate of all that is heavenly—as the kingdom of God.” In the heavenly kingdom the wisdom of God becomes manifest by means of the church, and particularly to these high and mighty ones, because these <span class="ital">are</span> now, in the heavenly kingdom founded by Christ, <span class="ital">brought</span>, by means of the church, <span class="ital">to the consciousness of their powerlessness</span>.—Thus, in fact, there are, as well in the notion of <span class="greekheb">κτίζειν</span> as in that of <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσ</span>., two wholly different conceptions combined, in opposition to the hermeneutic principle of the unity of the sense; <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span> is arbitrarily generalized in a spiritualistic way, and the thought that the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ καὶ ἐξουσίαι</span> are brought to the consciousness of their powerlessness is purely imported, and the more mistakenly, inasmuch as it is God’s <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>, not His <span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span>, of which it is here said that it is made manifest to the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ καὶ ἐξουσ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα γνωρισθῇ νῦν ταῖς ἀρχαῖς καὶ ταῖς ἐξουσίαις ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>: <span class="ital">in order that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenlies might be made known</span>. To make the manifold wisdom of God known where formerly it was not understood is now declared to be the <span class="ital">object</span> in view. But the object of <span class="ital">what?</span> The creation of all things, says Harless; who connects the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα γνωρισθῇ</span> immediately with the <span class="greekheb">τῷ τὰ πάντα κτίσαντι</span>. But, while it is true that redemption is sometimes exhibited in relation to creation (<a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-14</a>, etc.), and while Christ Himself is presented at times not only as the author and ground of creation but also as its end or object (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>), the idea resulting here on that view would be that the purpose of God in creating all things was the proclamation of His wisdom to the <span class="ital">angelic world by the Church</span>. This, however, would be a statement without any parallel elsewhere in the NT. It is better, therefore, to connect the sentence immediately with the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ ἀποκεκρυμμένου</span>, as is done by Meyer and many more. In that case the idea would be that the “mystery” was long hidden indeed, but hidden only with the design of being made known, and that on the widest possible scale—to angels no less than to men—in due time (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the general statement of principle in <a href="/mark/4-22.htm" title="For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.">Mark 4:22</a>). There is much to be said in support of this, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the antithesis of the <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> to the <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">γνωρισθῇ</span> to the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκεκρυμμένου</span>, etc. But it is best to take the verse as referring to the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐδόθη ἡ χάρις αὕτη</span>, etc. (Ell., Alf.; and substantially De Wette, Hofm., etc.). The main idea in the paragraph from <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a> onwards is unmistakably that of the marvellous call and commission of Paul, and the wonder of the grace that made an Apostle and preacher of him is magnified the more by the Divine purpose revealed in that commission, to wit, the making known the manifold wisdom of God in His ways with sinful men and with the outcasts of the Gentile world in particular. It is objected indeed that this is to make Paul claim for his own preaching and as his own special work what belonged to other Apostles and preachers no less than to him. But all that is stated here goes in point of fact to enhance the idea of Paul’s own personal insignificance, the extraordinary and unmerited nature of his call, and his absolute indebtedness to grace. “For this sublime cause,” as Alford admirably expresses it, “the humble Paul was raised up—to bring about—he, the least worthy of the saints—that to the heavenly powers themselves should be made known, by means of those whom he was empowered to enlighten”—the manifold wisdom of God. The <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span> can only mean <span class="ital">good</span> angels (<span class="ital">cf.</span> under <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a> above); and these names of <span class="ital">dignity</span> (the term <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελος</span> is not used in this Epistle) are appropriate here as suggesting again the <span class="ital">greatness</span> of Paul’s commission, and perhaps also (as Mey. thinks) the glory put upon the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>. That the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span> cannot mean any orders of earthly powers—Jewish, Gentile or Christian rulers or the like, is shown by the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>. Nor can they refer to <span class="ital">demonic</span> powers, whether by themselves alone or as part of the angelic world, for this would scarcely be consistent with the mention of the <span class="ital">Church</span>, and further the Divine <span class="ital">power</span> would in that case be more in point than the Divine <span class="ital">wisdom</span>. Nor again is there anything in the context to suggest that Paul has in view the angels that ministered the law and the elemental powers honoured by the heathen (V. Soden). The <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span> here, as elsewhere in the Epistle, has the sense = <span class="ital">in heaven</span>; see under <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a> above. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, therefore, has its proper local sense, and is not = <span class="ital">in respect of</span>, as if the clause meant “in the case of the heavenly things”. As the phrase makes one idea, too, with the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαῖς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαις</span>, defining them as <span class="ital">heavenly</span>, it requires no <span class="greekheb">ταῖς</span> after the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαις</span>.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς ἐκκλησίας</span>: <span class="ital">through the Church</span>. The <span class="ital">Church</span>, therefore, that is, as is evidently meant here, the whole body of believers in the unity in which Jew and Gentile are now made one, is the <span class="ital">means</span> by which the Divine wisdom is to be made known and Paul’s commission in that respect made good. The Church, which it was his high Apostolic vocation to build up by bringing multitudes of Gentile believers into its membership—the Church in which the breaking down of ancient barriers and the removal of the old enmity were now seen, was itself the living witness to the Divine <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>, the “mirror,” as Calvin puts it, “in which angels contemplate the wonderful wisdom of God”. And that Divine wisdom is described as <span class="greekheb">πολυποίκιλος</span> (a word found only this once in the NT)—not with any reference to <span class="ital">Gnostic</span> ideas of <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> (as Baur imagined), for the use of such a term as this in that connection is of later date (Iren., <span class="ital">Haer.</span>, i., 4, 1); nor simply in the sense of <span class="ital">very wise</span>, for which Aesch., <span class="ital">Prom.</span>, 1308, is mistakenly cited; but as = <span class="ital">multivarius, multiformis</span> (Vulg.), <span class="ital">having a great variety of forms</span>. The adj. is used of the rich variety of colours in cloths, flowers, paintings, etc. (Eurip., <span class="ital">Iph. T.</span>, 1149; Eubulus, <span class="ital">ap. Athen.</span>, 15, p. 679 D; <span class="ital">Orph. Hym.</span>, vi., 11; lxi., 4). In different ways had God dealt with men, with the Jew in one way and with the Gentile in another, in the long course of the ages. But in all these He had had one great end in view. Now in the <span class="ital">Church</span> the realisation of that end is seen, and in that great spiritual harmony angels can perceive the manifoldness and majesty of that Divine wisdom which by ways so diverse had been working to this great result. That angels have an interest in man’s redemption and desire to look into it is stated in <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a>.

To their pure and powerful but still finite intelligences the work of man’s Redemption is not only a touching interest, an object of benevolent attention; it is indescribably important, as a totally new and unique revelation of the Mind and Ways of their Lord, and perhaps (though here the hints of Scripture are few and dark) as indicating how their own bliss stands secure.—See some excellent pages on this last subject in <span class="ital">The Incarnation of the Eternal Word</span>, by the Rev.

The means of information to these exalted students is God’s way of redemption and glorification for His saints of our race; His action for and in “the blessed company of all faithful people.” The thought is one to stimulate the feeblest and most solitary Christian; while yet its chief concern is with the aggregate, the community, in which the grace which works freely and primarily in the individual attains its perfect harmony and speaks to the heavenly “watchers” (<a href="/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a>, &c.) with its full significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the manifold wisdom</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">the much variegated</span> wisdom.” The adjective is stronger (by the element “<span class="ital">much</span>,”) than that in <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm" title="As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.">1 Peter 4:10</a> (“manifold <span class="ital">grace</span>”). It occurs only here in N.T. The reference probably is to the <span class="ital">complicated problem</span> of man’s redemption, met and solved by the “unsearchable riches” of the work of Christ. Alike as a race and as individuals, man presented difficulties innumerable to the question, how shall God be just, and the justifier, and sanctifier, of this race? But <span class="ital">every</span> difficulty was, and is, met in “Christ, the Wisdom of God” (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Νῦν</span>) <span class="ital">now</span>, first: comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ταῖς ἀρχαῖς καὶ ταῖς ἐξουσίαις</span>, <span class="ital">to the principalities and powers</span>) good, or even bad; but in a different way to the one, as compared with the other.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ</span>, <span class="ital">by</span>) from those things which happen to the Church; for it (the Church) is the theatre in which the Divine works are displayed.

Their interest in the scheme of man's redemption is often referred to (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). Even the highest powers of heaven have yet much to learn respecting God. The dispensation of God's grace to man is one of their lesson-books. Dr. Chalmers shows ('Astronomical Discourses') how this meets the objection that so dread a sacrifice as the life of God's Son could not have been made for one poor planet; in its indirect bearings we do not know what other orders of beings have derived most vital lessons from this manifestation of the attributes of God. However men may scorn the salvation of Christ and all that belongs to it, the highest intelligences regard it with profound interest. <span class="cmt_word">By the Church the manifold wisdom of God.</span> Through the Church, now constituted, according' to the revealed mystery, of Jew and Gentile, all redeemed by Christ's blood and renewed by his Spirit, there is exhibited to the angels the manifold wisdom of God. The precise line of thought is this: God from eternity, had a purpose to put Jew and Gentile on precisely the same footing, but concealed it for many ages, until he revealed it in the apostolic age, when he appointed Paul his minister to announce it. The purpose of this whole arrangement was to enlighten the principalities and powers of heaven in the manifold wisdom of God. How in his manifold <span class="accented">wisdom?</span> In this way. During these preparatory ages, when God's gracious dealings were with the Jews only, all kinds of false religions were developing among <span class="accented">the</span> heathen, and their diversified influence and effects were becoming apparent in many ways - the divergent tendencies of men, especially in religious matters, were being developed; but in the new turn given to things by the breaking down of the middle wall in Christ, the manifold wisdom of God was shown in transforming many of these most diverse elements, unifying them, building them up into a great spiritual body, into a holy, most beautiful, most symmetrical temple. When all things seem to be flying asunder into the most diverse and antagonistic elements, God gives a new turn, as it were, to providence, and lo! a glorious symmetrical and harmonious structure begins to rise. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To the intent that<p>Connect with the matter of the two preceding verses.
