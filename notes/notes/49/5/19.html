There the idea is of teaching: “teaching and admonishing one another;” here, simply of a natural vent for emotion, especially of thanksgiving, although probably here also “to yourselves” means “to one another,” and refers, perhaps, chiefly to public worship. The well-known passage in Pliny, “Carmen dicere inter se invicem,” describes alternate, possibly antiphonal, singing of such sacred music. Of the various kinds of this music, the “psalms” and “hymns” are easily distinguished. The “psalm,” as the word itself implies, is music with instrumental accompaniment, and can hardly fail to refer to the Old Testament psalms, familiar in Jewish worship, and as we know, used in the first instance we have of apostolic worship (<a href="/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>). On their frequent use see <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>. The “hymn” is purely vocal music, apparently of the whole company (see <a href="/matthew/26-30.htm" title="And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.">Matthew 26:30</a>; <a href="/acts/16-25.htm" title="And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.">Acts 16:25</a>), more especially directed to praise of God, and probably designating the new utterances of the Christian Church itself. But the interpretation of the “spiritual song,” or “ode,” is more difficult. It is often considered as inclusive of the other two (as etymologically it might well be), but the genius of the passage appears to make it co-ordinate, and so distinct from them. From the use of the word “song,” or “ode,” as applied to lyric poetry, it may perhaps be conjectured that it describes more varied and elaborate music, sung by one person only—a spiritual utterance of one for the whole congregation. In a passage of Philo (2 p. 476)—quoted by Dr. Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>—on Jewish sacred music, we read, “He who stands up sings a hymn composed in praise of God, <span class= "ital">either having made a new one for himself, </span>or using an ancient one of the poets of days gone by.” The Christian counterpart of this might well be the “spiritual song.” To some such utterance, under the name of <span class= "ital">“</span>psalm,” St. Paul seems to allude in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>, a passage dealing expressly with special spiritual gifts. “Each one of you has a psalm.” Evidently it might be strictly a “hymn” or “psalm,” though in common usage (as here) it would be distinguished from both.<p><span class= "bld">Singing and making melody in your heart.</span>—The word rendered “making melody” is the verb corresponding to the “psalm” above, as singing to the “song.” This clause is not identical but co-ordinate with the last. That described audible and public melody; this, the secret utterance of music in the soul, whether accompanying the other or distinct from it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speaking to yourselves - Speaking among yourselves, that is, endeavoring to edify one another, and to promote purity of heart, by songs of praise. This has the force of a command, and it is a matter of obligation on Christians. From the beginning, praise was an important part of public worship, and is designed to be to the end of the world; see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>. Nothing is more clear than that it was practiced by the Saviour himself and the apostles (see <a href="/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>), and by the primitive church, as well as by the great body of Christians in all ages.<p>In psalms - The Psalms of David were sung by the Jews at the temple, and by the early Christians (notes <a href="/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>), and the singing of those psalms has constituted a delightful part of public worship in all ages. They speak the language of devotion at all times, and a large part of them are as well suited to the services of the sanctuary now as they were when first composed.<p>And hymns - It is not easy to determine precisely what is the difference in the meaning of the words used here, or to designate the kind of compositions which were used in the early churches. A "hymn" is properly a song or ode in honor of God. Among the pagan it was a song in honor of some deity. With us now it denotes a short poem, composed for religious service, and sung in praise to God. Such brief poems were common among the pagan, and it was natural that Christians should early introduce and adopt them. Whether any of them were composed by the apostles it is impossible now to determine, though the presumption is very strong that if they had been they would have been preserved with as much care as their epistles, or as the Psalms. One thing is proved clearly by this passage, that there were other compositions used in the praise of God than the Psalms of David; and if it was right then to make use of such compositions, it is now. They were not merely "Psalms" that were sung, but there were hymns and odes.<p>Spiritual songs - Spiritual "odes" - &#x3c9;&#787;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  o&#772;dais. Odes or songs relating to spiritual things in contradistinction from these which were sung in places of festivity and revelry. An "ode" is properly a short poem or song adapted to be set to music, or to be sung; a lyric poem. In what way these were sung, it is now vain to conjecture. Whether with or without instrumental accompaniments; whether by a choir or by the assembly; whether by an individual only, or whether they were by responses, it is not possible to decide from anything in the New Testament. It is probable that it would be done in the most simple manner possible. Yet as music constituted so important a part of the worship of the temple, it is evident that the early Christians would be by no means indifferent to the nature of the music which they had in their churches. And as it was so important a part of the worship of the pagan gods, and contributed so much to maintain the influence of paganism, it is not unlikely that the early Christians would feel the importance of making their music attractive, and of making it tributary to the support of religion. If there is attractive music at the banquet, and in the theater, contributing to the maintenance of amusements where God is forgotten, assuredly the music of the sanctuary should not be such as to disgust those of pure and refined taste.<p>Singing - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  adontes. The prevailing character of music in the worship of God should be vocal. If instruments are employed, they should be so subordinate that the service may be characterized as singing.<p>And making melody - "Melody" is an agreeable succession of sounds; a succession so regulated and modulated as to please the ear. It differs from "harmony," inasmuch as melody is an agreeable succession of sounds by a single voice; harmony consists in the accordance of different sounds. It is not certain, however, that the apostle here had reference to what is properly called "melody." The word which he uses - &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;  psallo&#772; - means to touch, twitch, pluck - as the hair, the beard; and then to twitch a string - to "twang" it - as the string of a bow, and then the string of an instrument of music. It is most frequently used in the sense of touching or playing a lyre, or a harp; and then it denotes to make music in general, to sing - perhaps usually with the idea of being accompanied with a lyre or harp. It is used, in the New Testament, only in <a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>, where it is translated "sing;" in <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, where it is rendered "sing psalms," and in the place before us. The idea here is, that of singing in the heart, or praising God from the heart. The psalms, and hymns, and songs were to be sung so that the heart should be engaged, and not so as to be mere music, or a mere external performance. On the phrase "in the heart," see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>.<p>To the Lord - In praise of the Lord, or addressed to him. Singing, as here meant, is a direct and solemn act of worship, and should be considered such as really as prayer. In singing we should regard ourselves as speaking directly to God, and the words, therefore, should be spoken with a solemnity and awe becoming such a direct address to the great Yahweh. So Pliny says of the early Christians, "Carmenquc Christo quasi Deo dicere secure invicem" - "and they sang among themselves hymns to Christ as God." If this be the true nature and design of public psalmody, then it follows:<p>(1) that all should regard it as an act of solemn worship in which they should engage - in "heart" at least, if they cannot themselves sing.<p>(2) public psalmody should not be entrusted wholly to the light and frivolous; to the trifling and careless part of a congregation.<p>(3) they who conduct this part of public worship ought to be pious. The leader "ought" to be a Christian; and they who join in it "ought" also to give their hearts to the Redeemer. Perhaps it would not be proper to say absolutely that no one who is not a professor of religion should take part in the exercises of a choir in a church; but thoro can be no error in saying that such persons "ought" to give themselves to Christ, and to sing from the heart. Their voices would be none the less sweet; their music no less pure and beautiful; nor could their own pleasure in the service be lessened. A choir of sweet singers in a church - united in the same praises here - "ought" to be prepared to join in the same praises around the throne of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Hence soon arose the antiphonal or responsive chanting of which Pliny writes to Trajan: "They are wont on a fixed day to meet before daylight [to avoid persecution] and to recite a hymn among themselves by turns, to Christ, as if being God."

By psalms are meant the Psalms of David, and others which compose the book that goes by that name, for other psalms there are none; and by "hymns" we are to understand, not such as are made by good men, without the inspiration of the Spirit of God; since they are placed between psalms and spiritual songs, made by men inspired by the Holy Ghost; and are put upon a level with them, and to be sung along with them, to the edification of churches; but these are only another name for the Book of Psalms, the running title of which may as well be the Book of Hymns, as it is rendered by Ainsworth; and the psalm which our Lord sung with his disciples after the supper, is called an hymn; and so are the psalms in general called hymns, by Philo the Jew (n); and songs and hymns by Josephus (o); and , "songs and praises", or "hymns", in the Talmud (p): and by "spiritual songs" are meant the same Psalms of David, Asaph, &amp;c. and the titles of many of them are songs, and sometimes a psalm and song, and song and psalm, a song of degrees; together with all other Scriptural songs, written by inspired men; and which are called "spiritual", because they are indited by the Spirit of God, consist of spiritual matter, and are designed for spiritual edification; and are opposed to all profane, loose, and wanton songs: these three words answer to  the several titles of David's Psalms; from whence it seems to be the intention of the apostle, that these should be sting in Gospel churches; for so he explains speaking to themselves in them, in the next clause: <p>singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; singing, as it is a distinct thing from prayer, so from giving of thanks, which is mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a> as another duty; it is not a mental praising of God, for it is called speaking, and teaching, and admonishing, but it is a praising of God with the modulation of the voice; and is rightly performed, when the heart and voice agree; when there is a melody in the heart, as well as in the tongue; for singing and making melody in the heart, is singing with, or from the heart, or heartily; of as elsewhere, "with grace", and which the Alexandrian copy reads here; that is, either with gratitude and thankfulness, or with grace in exercise; and the end in view should be the glory of God. <p>(n) De Mutat.

According to Harless, the two words are not different as regards their contents, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΑΛΜΟῖς</span></span></span> is the expression of the spiritual song for the <span class="ital">Jewish-Christians</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὕμνοις</span> for the <span class="ital">Gentile-Christians</span>. An external distinction in itself improbable, and very arbitrary, since the special signification of <span class="greekheb">ὕμνος</span>, <span class="ital">song of praise</span>, is thoroughly established, and <span class="greekheb">ψαλμός</span> also was a word very current in Greek, which—as well in itself as more especially with regard to its sense established in Christian usage in accordance with the conception of the O. T. psalms—could not but be equally intelligible for the Gentile-Christians as for the Jewish-Christians. See also Rudelb. in the <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. Luth. Theol.</span> 1855, 4, p. 634 f. According to Olshausen, <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοί</span> are here the <span class="ital">psalms of the O. T.</span>, which had passed over from the synagogue into the use of the church. But worship is not spoken of here; and that the Christians, filled by the Spirit, <span class="ital">improvised</span> psalms, is clear from <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm" title="What is it then?

But how could it have occurred to Paul here to enter such a protest against mere lip-praise, when he, in fact, represents the psalm-singing, etc., as the utterance of the being filled by the Spirit, and makes express mention of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΥΜΑΤΙΚΑῖς ᾨΔΑῖς</span></span></span>, in which case, at any rate, the thought of a mere singing with the mouth was of itself excluded. The right view is found substantially in Rückert (who, nevertheless, already here imports an “<span class="ital">always</span>”), Harless, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Schenkel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῷ κυρίῳ</span>] <span class="ital">to Christ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm" title="Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Ephesians 5:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[267] Pliny, <span class="ital">Ep</span>. x. 97: “Carmen Christo quasi Deo dicunt <span class="ital">stecum invicem</span>” (<span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῖς</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[268] A <span class="ital">collection</span> of church-hymns is of course not even remotely to be thought of in our passage; and it is to <span class="ital">go in quest</span> of a reason for suspecting our Epistle, when, with Schwegler, the mention of <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is designated as surprising.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm" title="Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;">Ephesians 5:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">λαλοῦντες ἑαυτοῖς ψαλμοῖς καὶ ὕμνοις καὶ ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς</span>: <span class="ital">speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</span>.

But in all probability <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῖς</span> has the reciprocal sense = <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλοις</span>, as in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Jelf, <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, § 654, 2). The idea is not that of <span class="ital">meditation</span>, but that of <span class="ital">converse</span>. There is nothing, however, to suggest the thought of actual <span class="ital">worship</span>. The sentence specifies one of the ways in which the condition of being “filled with the Spirit” would express itself. In their intercourse one with another their language would not be that of ordinary convention, far less that of base intoxication, but that of spiritual devotion and thankfulness. Reference is made by many commentators to Pliny’s well-known report of the practice of the Christians of Bithynia and Pontus—carmen Christo quasi Deo dicunt <span class="ital">secum invicem</span> (Ep., x., 97); but what is in view there is responsive praise in the Lord’s Day worship. <span class="ital">Psalms, hymns</span>, and <span class="ital">spiritual songs</span> are mentioned again in <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>. What the distinctions are, if any, between the three terms has been considerably disputed. <span class="greekheb">ψαλμός</span> is a religious song, especially one sung to a musical accompaniment, and <span class="ital">par excellence</span> an OT psalm; <span class="greekheb">ὕμνος</span> is properly speaking a song of <span class="ital">praise</span>; <span class="greekheb">ᾠδή</span> is the most general term, applicable to all kinds of songs, secular or sacred, accompanied or unaccompanied (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Trench, <span class="ital">Syn.</span>, p. 279; Light. on <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>). The three words are brought together here with a view to rhetorical force, and it is precarious, therefore, to build much upon supposed differences between them. There is nothing to warrant Harless’s idea that the <span class="greekheb">ψαλμός</span> is the spiritual song for <span class="ital">Jewish</span>-Christians and the <span class="greekheb">ὕμνος</span> for <span class="ital">Gentile</span>-Christians; or Olshausen’s supposition that the term <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοῖς</span> is to be limited to the OT psalms which had passed over into the Christian Church. There were <span class="ital">Christian</span> psalms—psalms which the Holy Spirit moved the primitive Christians to utter when they came together in worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm" title="What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>), as He moved them to speak with tongues (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>). It is probable, therefore, that these are intended here, especially in view of what has been said of being “filled by the Spirit”. If the terms, therefore, are to be distinguished at all, the case will be simply this—that the <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοί</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ὕμνοι</span> are specific kinds of <span class="greekheb">ᾠδαί πνευματικαί</span>, and that the former are the Christian psalms which worshippers were inspired to sing, and which no doubt would be like the familiar psalms of Israel, while the latter were songs of praise to Christ or to God. On this view the adj. <span class="greekheb">πνευματικαῖς</span> is attached to the <span class="greekheb">ᾠδαῖς</span> not merely to differentiate these <span class="greekheb">ᾠδαί</span> as religious and not secular, but to describe them as inspired by the Holy Ghost.—<span class="greekheb">ᾄδοντες καὶ ψάλλοντες ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ</span>: <span class="ital">singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> of the TR is supported by [581] [582], most cursives, Syr.-Harcl., Arm., etc. It is omitted by [583] [584] [585], Orig., etc., and is deleted by LT[Tr]WHRV. For <span class="greekheb">τῇ καρδίᾳ</span>, Lachm. prefers <span class="greekheb">ταῖς καρδίαις</span>, which is given by [586]3[587] [588] [589] [590], Vulg., Boh., Syr. <span class="greekheb">ψάλλοντες</span>, properly = <span class="ital">playing</span> on a stringed instrument, and then = <span class="ital">singing</span>, especially to an instrument (<a href="/romans/15-9.htm" title="And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.">Romans 15:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm" title="What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>; <a href="/james/5-13.htm" title="Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.">Jam 5:13</a>). The <span class="greekheb">τῷ Κυρίῳ</span> will have its usual reference, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to <span class="ital">Christ.</span> The question, however, is whether this clause is to be taken as <span class="ital">coordinate</span> or as <span class="ital">subordinate</span>. Does it <span class="ital">add</span> something to the previous <span class="greekheb">λαλοῦντες</span> clause, or simply explain and extend it? The latter view has been accepted by many from Theodoret downwards, who understand the point here to be that the speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs was not to be a formal thing or a matter of the lips only, but the utterance of the heart, “with the heart” (RV). But this would be expressed rather by <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς καρδίας</span> or <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν</span>. The rendering “heartily” also would be easier if there were no <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>. Besides the contrast in the context is not between lip-praise and heart-praise on the part of Christians, but between Christian converse expressing itself in praise, and the vain or profligate talk of the heathen. Hence (with Harl., Mey., Ell., Alf.), it is best to give <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> its proper sense of <span class="ital">in</span>, and to understand the clause as referring to the melody that takes place in the stillness of the heart. It specifies a second kind of praise in addition to that of the <span class="greekheb">λαλοῦντες</span>—the unvoiced praise of meditation and inward worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[578] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[579] Codex Porphyrianus (sæc. ix.), at St. Petersburg, collated by Tischendorf.

V. here, as the much most natural reference there is to <span class="ital">mutual</span> edification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been thought that we have here a suggestion of responsive chanting. But this is most precarious, to say the least; the words being fully satisfied by the thought of the <span class="ital">mutual</span> spiritual help, most real and powerful now as then, given on any occasion of <span class="ital">common</span> spiritual praise. The first disciples thus “spoke <span class="ital">one to another</span>” in the united outburst of ascription and praise, <a href="/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>. Still, it is interesting to remember that responsive hymn-singing was, as a fact, used very early in Christian worship. In the famous Letter of Pliny to Trajan (written between a. d. 108 and a. d. 114), where the worship of the Christians is described, we read; “they are used to meet before dawn on a stated day, and to chant (<span class="ital">carmen dicere</span>) to Christ, as to a God, alternately together (<span class="ital">secum invicem</span>).” See Alford’s note here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">psalms</span> … <span class="ital">hymns</span> … <span class="ital">spiritual songs</span>] It is impossible to fix precisely the limits of these terms; nor does the character of the passage, full of the spirit rather than the theory of praise, demand it. But there is probability in the suggestion that the <span class="ital">psalm</span> was generally a rhythmic utterance, either actually one of the O. T. psalms, or in their manner; the <span class="ital">hymn</span>, a rhythmic utterance of praise distinctively Christian; and the spiritual <span class="ital">song</span>, or spiritual <span class="ital">ode</span>, a similar utterance, but more of experience or meditation than of praise. The canticles of Luke 1, 2, would thus rank as psalms; the inspired chant of the disciples (Acts 4) as a hymn; and the possibly rhythmic “faithful words” in the Pastoral Epistles (see esp. <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:...">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>) as spiritual odes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another suggested distinction is that a psalm (Gr., <span class="ital">psallein</span>, to <span class="ital">play</span>,) demanded instrumental accompaniment, a hymn did not. But this cannot be sustained in detail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Psalm-singing” (see further <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation.

Is any merry? let him sing psalms.">James 5:13</a>) is thus a primeval element in not only Christian worship but Christian common life; for the Apostle here evidently contemplates social gatherings rather than formulated services; similar occasions to those formerly defaced by “excess of wine.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The history of psalmody and hymnody in the Church cannot be discussed, however briefly, here. See articles on <span class="ital">Hymns</span>, in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionaries</span> (of the Bible and of Christian Antiquities). We may just note that (1) Pliny (quoted above on this verse) speaks already of Christian hymnody, very early cent. 2; (2) St Justin, rather later cent. 2, in his account of Sunday eucharistic worship makes no distinct allusion to it; but (3) a century later the allusions are frequent. See <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Eusebius, <span class="ital">Hist. Eccl.</span> v. 28, 7:30. The “earliest known Christian hymn” is a noble Greek hymn, in anapæstic metre, to the Son of God, by St Clement of Alexandria, at the end of his <span class="ital">Pædagogus</span> (middle of cent. 3).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Spiritual</span> songs”<span class="ital">:</span>—not necessarily “inspired,” but charged with spiritual truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">making melody</span>] Lit. “<span class="ital">playing instruments</span>” (<span class="ital">psallontes, psalm</span>).

In the Epistle to the Colossians it is, "Teaching and admonishing one another with psalms," and this has more of the idea of public worship; and if it be proper to express joyful feelings in the comparatively private social gatherings of Christians, it is proper to do the same in united public worship. <span class="cmt_word">In psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.</span> The precise meaning of these terms is not easily seen; "psalms" we should naturally apply to the Old Testament psalms, but the want of the article makes the meaning more general, equivalent to "songs with the character of the psalms;" hymns, songs celebrating the praises of the Divine Being, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; "spiritual songs" or odes of a more general cast, meditative, historical, hortatory, or didactic. But these must be "spiritual," such as the Holy Spirit would lead us to use and would use with us for our good. The two clauses correspond: "be filled with the Spirit;" "speaking in spiritual songs." Receive the Spirit - pour out the Spirit; let your songs be effusions sent forth from your hearts with the aroma of the Holy Spirit. Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Lord Jesus. Some have argued that while <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> denotes singing, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> means striking the musical instrument. But <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is so frequently used in a more general sense, that it can hardly be restricted to this meaning here. The great thought is that this musical service must not be musical only, but a service of the heart, in rendering which the heart must be in a state of worship. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Speaking to yourselves (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., one to another.<p>The A.V. is literally correct, but is open to the misinterpretation each one communing with himself.
