The reason why the apostle, in this and his other epistles, condemned fornication and every sort of uncleanness in such an express manner, was because the heathen avowedly practised these vices even in their temples as acts of worship, which they thought rendered them acceptable to their gods. But how different from such practices is the conduct enjoined in the gospel, which teaches that they who continue in such abominations, shall for ever be excluded from the presence and glory of God. <span class="ital">Nor covetous man </span>— That is, the man whose chief desire and care is to increase his wealth, either that he may spend it on the gratification of his lusts, or may hoard it up; <span class="ital">who is an idolater </span>— As placing that love, delight, and confidence in riches, which ought to be placed in God alone; or because he sets up something else, whatever may be the object of his covetous desires, and something comparatively very base and contemptible, in the place of God, as if it could be the ground of his dependance, and the source of his happiness. <span class="ital">Let no man deceive you with vain words </span>— Or sophistical arguments, as if you might live in the commission of such sins, and yet find mercy with God, or escape punishment. <span class="ital">For because of these </span>and the like <span class="ital">things,</span> <span class="ital">cometh the wrath of God </span>— And the dreadful effects thereof, <span class="ital">on the children of disobedience </span>— Even on the Gentiles, though not favoured with the light and aids which you have, demonstrating to you the infinite evil of all such practices, and affording you sufficient power to avoid them. Now, if even heathens are punished for such practices, much less can we suppose that professing Christians, who have so much greater advantages for practising purity and virtue in all their branches, and are under such strong and peculiar engagements so to do, shall escape with impunity if they pursue a similar line of conduct. <span class="ital">Be not ye therefore partakers with them </span>— In these abominations, if ye would not finally partake in that dreadful punishment which they are bringing on themselves thereby.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this ye know - Be assured of this. The object here is to deter from indulgence in those vices by the solemn assurance that no one who committed them could possibly be saved.<p>Nor unclean person - No one of corrupt and licentious life can be saved; see <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>.<p>Nor covetous man, who is an idolater - That is, he bestows on money the affections due to God; see <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. To worship money is as real idolatry as to worship a block of stone. If this be so, what an idolatrous world is this! How many idolatrous are there in professedly Christian lands! How many, it is to be feared, in the church itself! And since every covetous man is certainly to be excluded from the kingdom of God, how anxious should we be to examine our hearts, and to know whether this sin may not lie at our door!<p>Hath any inheritance, ... - Such an one shall never enter heaven. This settles the inquiry about the final destiny of a large portion of the world; and this solemn sentence our conscience and all our views of heaven approve. Let us learn hence:<p>(1) that heaven will be "pure."<p>(2) that it will be a "desirable" place for who would wish to live always with the licentious and the impure?<p>(3) it is right to reprove these vices and to preach against them. Shall we not be allowed to preach against those sins which will certainly exclude people from heaven?<p>(4) a large part of the world is exposed to the wrath of God. What numbers are covetous! What multitudes are licentious! In how many places is licentiousness openly and unblushingly practiced! In how many more places in secret! And in how many more is the "heart" polluted, while the external conduct is moral; the soul "corrupt," while the individual moves in respectable society!<p>(5) what a world of shame will hell be! How dishonorable and disgraceful to be damned forever, and to linger on in eternal fires, because the man was too polluted to be admitted into pure society! Here, perhaps, he moved in fashionable life, and was rich and honored, and flattered; there he will be sent down to hell because his whole soul was corrupt, and because God would not suffer heaven to be contaminated by his presence!<p>(6) what doom awaits the "covetous" man! He, like the sensualist, is to be excluded from the kingdom of God. And what is to be his doom? Will he have a place apart from the common damned - a golden palace and a bed of down in hell? No. It will be no small part of his aggravation that he will be doomed to spend an eternity with those in comparison with whom on earth, perhaps, he thought himself to be pure as an angel of light.<p>(7) with this multitude of the licentious and the covetous, will sink to hell all who are not renewed and sanctified. What a prospect for the "happy," the fashionable, the moral, the amiable, and the lovely, who have no religion! For all the impenitent and the unbelieving, there is but one home in eternity. Hell is less terrible from its penal fires and its smoke of torment, than from its being made up of the profane, the sensual, and the vile; and its supremest horrors arise from its being the place where shall be gathered all the corrupt and unholy dwellers in a fallen world; all who are so impure that they cannot be admitted into heaven. Why then will the refined, the moral, and the amiable not be persuaded to seek the society of a pure heaven? to be prepared for the world where holy beings dwell? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. this ye know&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "Of this ye are sure knowing"; or as Alford, "This ye know being aware."<p>covetous &#8230; idolater&#8212;(Col 3:5).

The TR reads <span class="greekheb">ἐστε</span> = <span class="ital">ye are</span> (with [523]3[524] [525], Theod., Theophyl., etc.), taking it with the participle as = “ye are aware”. But <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> (which is supported by [526] [527] [528] [529]*[530] [531], Vulg., Goth., Sah., Boh., Arm., Chrys., etc.) must be preferred. The phrase <span class="greekheb">ἴστε γινώσκοντες</span> is explained by some as a Hebr. form, following the well-known use of the inf. with the fin. verb, or as having the force of the participle with the fin. verb in such expressions as <span class="greekheb">γινώσκων γνώσῃ</span> (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>); and so the RV renders it—“ye know of a surety”. But in such formulæ the <span class="ital">same</span> verb occurs in both cases, whereas here we have two distinct verbs. Hence it is best rendered—“ye know, being aware that”. It is an appeal to their consciousness of the incompatibility of such sins with the inheritance of the Kingdom of God. It is not necessary, therefore (with von Hofmann), to put a full stop between the <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> and the <span class="greekheb">γινώσκοντες</span>, and make <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> refer to the <span class="ital">preceding</span> statement. Nor is there any reason for taking <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> as an imper. (so Vulg., Beng., etc.) instead of an indic. The <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> refers to what <span class="ital">follows</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> introduces a reason for the former injunctions. These injunctions are enforced by a reference to the reader’s own knowledge, and that reference to their knowledge is made in direct appeal to their consciousness.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶς πόρνος ἢ ἀκάθαρτος</span>: <span class="ital">that no fornicator or unclean person</span>. On the Hebr. formula <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span>, “every one … shall not,” see on <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29</a> above and Win.-Moult., p. 209.—<span class="greekheb">ἤ πλεονέκτης</span>: <span class="ital">or covetous man</span>. The <span class="greekheb">πλεονέκτης</span> appears here again to have its proper sense, and not any secondary application.—<span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν εἰδωλολάτρης</span>: <span class="ital">who is an idolater</span>. This reading of the TR has the support of [532] [533] [534] [535] [536], Syr.-Harcl., Boh., Arm., Chrys., etc. But there are two interesting variants, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν εἰδωλολατρεία</span>, which is the reading of [537], Vulg., Goth., Syr.-Pes. (probably), and <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν εἰδωλολάτρης</span>, which is given by [538] [539], 672, Jer., etc. The choice must be between this last and the TR. On the whole the former is to be preferred (with LTTrWHRV) on textual grounds, and that reading will then have the force of “which is the same as an idolater”. Some (Harl., etc.) refer the relative (<span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>) to all three previous nouns; but the analogy of <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a> is against that. It is true that <span class="ital">fornication</span> and <span class="ital">uncleanness</span> might also well be called forms of idolatry. But the point here seems to be that the <span class="ital">covetous, grasping</span> man in particular, who makes a god of Mammon, is much the same as the worshipper of an idol; and the <span class="greekheb">πλεονέκτης</span> is thus made synonymous with the <span class="greekheb">εἰδωλολάτρης</span> in order to stigmatise avarice as a specifically anti-Christian vice, essentially incompatible with the spirit of self-sacrifice which is of the very being of Christianity and was inculcated so strenuously by Paul himself.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔχει κληρονομίαν</span>: <span class="ital">has inheritance</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἔχει</span> is taken by Meyer as a case of <span class="ital">present</span> for <span class="ital">future</span>, marking a looked-for event as just as certain as if it were already with us. But it is rather a proper present, appropriate here as the expression of a principle or law; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 331.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ χριστοῦ καὶ Θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in the Kingdom of Christ and God</span>. The clause has been understood as an affirmation of Christ’s Godhead, as if = “the Kingdom of Him who is at once Christ and God” (Beza, Beng., Rück., Harl.); and some, with this view of its import, have held it to be an example of the application of Sharp’s rule. But that rule is inapplicable here by reason of the fact that <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> is independent of the article and occurs indeed without it in the phrase <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Monod remarks that this clause points rather to the <span class="ital">miser</span> than the <span class="ital">seducer</span>; and most certainly it includes the miser. But there is a terrible fitness also in the other application; and we cannot but think that “covetousness” had, in the apostolic age, a familiar reference, among other references, to immoral cupidity.

It conveys regularly the thought of possession by title, whether actually enjoyed or in prospect. An “inheritor” (<span class="ital">clêronomos</span>) may be thus either a present occupant, or an expectant “heir,” as context may indicate. Here probably the expected possession of glory is mainly in view, though we cannot exclude some reference to the organic antecedent to glory—the present possession of “life eternal.” See further next note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the kingdom of Christ and of God</span>] the realm of the Son, Who “gave Himself for our sins,” that He might be our “Lord” (<a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>); and of the Father, Who gave the Son that the redeemed might “yield themselves unto God” (<a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>). The secret of admission to this kingdom, and of congenial life in it, is “to know the only true God and Jesus Christ Whom He hath sent” (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). The more common phrase “kingdom of God” is here displaced by one specially suggestive of the holy <span class="ital">conditions</span> of membership implied in the mention of Christ.—See note on <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>, on the word “God” in such collocations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What is the “Kingdom” here? On the whole, the glorified state, the goal of the process of grace. True, the word often, with obvious fitness, includes the period of grace in this life, in which most truly the Christian is a subject of the King (see <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/11-2.htm" title="Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,">Matthew 11:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm" title="The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;">Matthew 13:41</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-43.htm" title="Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.">Matthew 21:43</a>; <a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>). But usage gives the word a special connexion with the final state, glory; cp. esp. <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a> (specially in point here); <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>.

But the phase to come, that of perfect and eternal result and development, is naturally the predominant phase of the word. The practical meaning here, then, is “no such moral rebel can be, while such, a citizen of and pilgrim to the heavenly city.” See <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔστε</span>, <span class="ital">be ye</span>) [<span class="ital">knowing</span>.
