(See, for example, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm" title="Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.">1Corinthians 15:58</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm" title="Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.">Ephesians 5:33</a></span>. <span class="ital">Nevertheless </span>— As if he said, But though there be such a mystical sense in the marriage of Adam and Eve, or in the union subsisting between a man and his wife; though it be a striking emblem of the union between Christ and his church, yet the plain, literal sense especially now concerns you. <span class="ital">Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself </span>— That is, with a sincere, peculiar, cordial, and prevailing affection, like that which he bears to himself: <span class="ital">and </span>let <span class="ital">the wife see that she reverence her husband </span>— That she entertain a high esteem for him, be desirous of pleasing him in all things lawful, reasonable, and proper, and fear to give him unnecessarily any just offence in any thing, persuaded that it is the will of God, and the law of the relation in which she stands to him, that she should thus conduct herself toward him. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless - The apostle here resumes the subject which he had been discussing in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-29</a>, and says that it was the duty of every man to love his wife as he did himself. This was the main topic, from which he had been diverted by the discussion respecting the love which the Redeemer had shown for his church.<p>And the wife see that she reverence her husband - The word "see" is supplied by our translators. The meaning is, that it was the special duty of the wife to show respect for her husband as the head of the family, and as set over her in the Lord; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>, note 28, note. The word rendered "reverence," is that which usually denotes "fear" - &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  phobe&#772;tai. She is to fear; i. e., to honor, respect, obey the will of her husband. It is, of course, not implied that it is not also her duty to love her husband, but that there should be no usurping of authority; no disregard of the arrangement which God has made; and that order and peace should be secured in a family by regarding the husband as the source of law.<p>From what is here said of the duties of husband and wife we may remark:<p>(1) That the happiness of society depends on just views of the marriage relation. It is true the world over, that the views which prevail in regard to this relation, determine everything in reference to all other relations of life, and to all other sources of enjoyment.<p>(2) God designed that woman should occupy a subordinate, though an important place in the relations of social life. This arrangement is never disregarded without evils which cannot be corrected until the original intention is secured. No imaginary good that can come out of the violation of the original design; no benefits which females, individual or associated, can confer on mankind by disregarding this arrangement, can be a compensation for the evil that is done, nor can the evil be remedied unless woman occupies the place which God designed she should fill. There nothing else can supply her place; and when she is absent from that situation - no matter what good she may be doing elsewhere - there is a silent evil reigning, which can be removed only by her return. It is not hers to fight battles, or to command armies and navies, or to control kingdoms, or to make laws. Nor is it hers to go forward as a public leader even in enterprises of benevolence, or in associations designed to act on the public mind. Her empire is the domestic circle; her first influence is there; and in connection with that, in such scenes as she can engage in without trenching on the prerogative of man, or neglecting the duty which she owes to her own family.<p>(3) it is not best that there should be the open exercise of authority in a family. When "commands" begin in the relation of husband and wife, "happiness" flies; and the moment a husband is "disposed" to command his wife, or is "under a necessity" of doing it, that moment he may bid adieu to domestic peace and joy.<p>(4) a wife, therefore, should never give her husband "occasion" to command her to do anything, or forbid anything. His known wish, except in cases of conscience, should be law to her. The moment she can ascertain what his will is, that moment ought to settle her mind as to what is to be done.<p>(5) a husband should never "wish" or "expect" anything that it may not be perfectly proper for a wife to render. He, too, should consult "her" wishes; and when he understands what they are, he should regard what she prefers as the very thing which he would command. The known wish and preference of a wife, unless there be something wrong in it, should be allowed to influence his mind, and be that which he directs in the family.<p>(6) there is no danger that a husband will love a wife too much, provides his love be subordinate to the love of God. The command is, to love her as Christ loved the church. What love has ever been like that? How can a husband exceed it? What did not Christ endure to redeem the church? So should a husband be willing to deny himself to promote the happiness of his wife; to watch by her in sickness, and, if need be, to peril health and life to promote her welfare. Doing this, he will not go beyond what Christ did for the church. He should remember that she has a special claim of justice on him. For him she has left her father's home, forsaken the friends of her youth, endowed him with whatever property she may have, sunk her name in his, confided her honor, her character, and her happiness, to his virtue; and the least that he can do for her is to love her, and strive to make her happy. This was what she asked when she consented to become his; and a husband's love is what she still asks to sustain and cheer her in the trials of life. If she has not this, whither shall she go for comfort?<p>(7) we may see, then, the guilt of those husbands who withhold their affections from their wives, and forsake those to whom they had solemnly pledged themselves at the altar; those who neglect to provide for their needs, or to minister to them in sickness; and those who become the victims of intemperance, and leave their wives to tears. There is much, much guilt of this kind on earth. There are many, many broken vows. There are many, many hearts made to bleed. There is many a pure and virtuous woman who was once the object of tender affection, now, by no fault of hers, forsaken, abused, broken-hearted, by the brutal conduct of a husband,<p>(8) wives should manifest such a character as to be worthy of love. They owe this to their husbands. They demand the confidence and affection of man; and they should show that they are worthy of that confidence and affection. It is not possible to love that which is unlovely, nor to force affection where it is undeserved; and, as a wife expects that a husband will love her more than he does any other earthly being, it is but right that she should evince such a spirit as shall make that proper. A wife may easily alienate the affections of her partner in life. If she is irritable and fault-finding; if none of his ways please her; if she takes no interest in his plans, and in what he does; if she forsakes her home when she should he there, and seeks happiness abroad; or if, at home, she never greets him with a smile; if she is wasteful of his earnings, and extravagant in her habits, it will be impossible to prevent the effects of such a course of life on his mind. And when a wife perceives the slightest evidence of alienated affection in her husband, she should inquire at once whether she has not given occasion for it, and exhibited such a spirit as tended inevitably to produce such a result.<p>(9) to secure mutual love, therefore, it is necessary that there should be mutual kindness, and mutual loveliness of character. Whatever is seen to be offensive or painful, should be at once abandoned. All the little peculiarities of temper and modes of speech that are observed to give pain, should be forsaken; and, while one party should endeavor to tolerate them, and not to be offended, the other should make it a matter of conscience to remove them.<p>(10) the great secret of conjugal happiness is in the cultivation of a proper temper. It is not so much in the great and trying scenes of life that the strength of virtue is tested; it is in the events that are constantly occurring; the manifestation of kindness in the things that are happening every moment; the gentleness that flows along every day, like the stream that winds through the meadow and around the farm-house, noiseless but useful, diffusing fertility by day and by night. Great deeds rarely occur. The happiness of life depends little on them, but mainly on the little acts of kindness in life. We need them everywhere; we need them always. And eminently in the marriage relation there is need of gentleness and love, returning each morning, beaming in the eye, and dwelling in the heart through the livelong day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.

T. 722]) prefixed, not yet dependent on the notion of <span class="ital">volo</span> (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>) to be supplied in thought before <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>. Hence: <span class="ital">but the wife—she ought to fear her husband</span>. In this brief stern closing utterance, the apostle, while stating the obligation of the husband to love the wife <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἑαυτόν</span>, yet secures as concerns the wife the relation of subordination, namely, the duty of <span class="ital">reverence for the husband</span>—a duty, which is not done away with by that obligation on the part of the husband. “Optime cohaerebit concordia, si <span class="ital">utrimque</span> constabunt officia,” Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>. Rightly, we may add, in accordance with the context Oecumenius defines the notion of <span class="greekheb">φοβῆται</span>: <span class="greekheb">ὡς πρέπει γυναῖκα φοβεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ δουλοπρεπῶς</span>. See <a href="/context/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord....">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm" title="Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.">Ephesians 5:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">πλὴν καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ καθʼ ἕνα</span>: <span class="ital">nevertheless ye also severally</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>, connected probably with <span class="greekheb">πλέον</span> and meaning primarily <span class="ital">further, besides</span>, is used both for <span class="ital">unfolding</span> (= moreover); and for <span class="ital">restricting</span> (= <span class="ital">howbeit, nevertheless; cf.</span> Thayer-Grimm, <span class="ital">ut sup.</span>, p. 517; Donaldson, <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, § 548). Here probably it has the latter application, = “nevertheless, not to say more of that higher union, see that ye, all of you, fulfil the obligation of love to your wives”. The distributive phrase <span class="greekheb">οἱ καθʼ ἕνα</span>, “ye one by one,” individualises the <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, and excludes all exceptions. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> conjoins the <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> with Christ, = “in you also, as in Christ, <span class="ital">love</span> is to be fulfilled”. <span class="greekheb">ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα οὕτως ἀγαπάτω ὡς ἑαυτόν</span>: <span class="ital">let each one of you love his own wife as himself</span>.

The <span class="greekheb">ἕκαστος</span> expresses still more emphatically the absoluteness and universality of the Christian duty of conjugal love—a duty from which no single husband is exempt. As in <a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a> the <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> means not merely that each husband is to love his wife as he loves himself, but that he is to love her as <span class="ital">being</span> himself, part and parcel of himself according to the Divine idea of the marriage union.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἵνα φοβῆται τὸν ἄνδρα</span>: <span class="ital">and the wife—let her see that she fear her husband</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ γυνή</span> is a <span class="ital">nom. absol.</span> of a simple kind and emphatic; the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is metabatic and slightly adversative; = “so much has been said of the husband, and as to the wife now, reverence is her part”. The change in the construction from the usual imperative to the form <span class="greekheb">ἵνα φοβῆται</span> is explained by some by supplying <span class="greekheb">βλεπέτω</span>, as <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span> stands in <a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm" title="See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,">Ephesians 5:15</a>.

The fear of respect, of reverence, is obviously meant, and we prefer the expression of this as in A.V.
