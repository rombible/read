We know that in the Colossian Church there was an anticipation of the more ascetic Gnosticism (<a href="/colossians/2-21.htm" title=" (Touch not; taste not; handle not;">Colossians 2:21</a>; comp. also <a href="/context/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1-5</a>). As the earlier Judaistic rigour had assumed this later form, so the earlier Antinomianism (of <a href="/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>) may probably have passed into the more systematic and speculative Antinomianism of the Gnostic type. (Comp. <a href="/context/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Philippians 3:18-19</a>.) In this same spirit St. John, himself familiar with the life of Ephesus, writes earnestly: “Let no man deceive you; he that doeth righteousness is righteous” (<a href="/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1John 3:7</a>).

These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man deceive you - Let no one by artful pleas persuade you that; there will be no danger from practicing these vices, We may suppose that they would be under strong temptations to mingle in the "happy" and festive scenes where these vices were not frowned on, or where they were practiced; or that they might be tempted to commit them by some of the plausible arguments which were then used for their indulgence. Many of their friends may have been in these circles; and they would endeavor to convince them that such were the customs which had been long practiced, and that there could be no harm still in their indulgence. Not a few philosophers endeavored, as is well known, to defend some of these practices, and even practiced them themselves; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.

But what is the reference? Some think <span class="ital">heathen philosophers</span> and <span class="ital">Jews</span> are in view (Grot.), or <span class="ital">Judaisers</span> in particular (Neand.), or <span class="ital">antinomian Christians</span> (Olsh.), or <span class="ital">teachers of Gentile tendencies</span> (Meyer), or <span class="ital">false brethren in the Churches</span> (Abb.). But the expression is a general one, applying to all who sought by their sophistries to palliate the vices in question or make them appear to be no vices. These would be found mostly (though by no manner of necessity exclusively) among the heathen, especially among such Gentiles as heard the truth and remained unbelieving. This is most accordant with the descriptive terms which follow, <span class="ital">viz.</span>—<span class="greekheb">υἱοὺς τῆς ἀπειθείας</span>; <span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">συμμέτοχοι αὐτῶν</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἦτε γάρ ποτε σκότος</span>. (So Mey., Ell., etc.)—<span class="greekheb">διὰ ταῦτα γὰρ ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">for because of these things cometh the wrath of God</span>. The <span class="greekheb">διὰ ταῦτα</span>, which is placed emphatically first, refers of course to the <span class="ital">sins</span> in question; not to the “vain words,” as Chrys., <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, strangely thought. The certainty of the Divine retribution is added as an enforcement of the previous warnings. It is given in terms of a solemn present (<span class="greekheb">ἔρχεται</span>) and in the form of “the wrath of God”—an expression which occupies a very large place both in the OT and in the NT. This <span class="greekheb">ὀργὴ τοῦ θεοῦ</span> is not to be limited (with Ritschl.) to the judgment of the last day, or taken as synonymous with the <span class="ital">vindicta Dei</span>, or resolved into a figure of speech with no reality behind it, or identified simply with certain <span class="ital">effects</span>—the workings of conscience, the shortness and the ills of life, the penalties of the present existence, etc. It is given in Scripture, just as the love, the righteousness, the holiness of God are given, as an <span class="ital">affectus</span> and not merely an <span class="ital">effectus</span>, a quality of the perfect moral nature of God, an attitude and sensibility of the Divine Mind toward evil. It is exhibited as operating now, but also as looking to fulfil itself completely in the final adjustment. Here its future operation in the ultimate awards may be specially in view, but not that alone. Meyer puts it too narrowly when he says it is “the wrath of God <span class="ital">in the day of judgment</span>, which future, as in <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, is realised as present”.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῆς ἀπειθείας</span>: <span class="ital">upon the sons of disobedience</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθείας</span> WH prefer <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθείας</span>. The phrase has been used already in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>, and there with reference to the unregenerate. Here, again, it describes the persons in respect of their “essential and innate disobedience” (Ell.).
