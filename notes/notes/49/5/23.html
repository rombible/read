There “the head of the woman is the man,” as here; but “the head of every man (individually) is Christ,” considered in His human nature; and finally, “the Head of Christ,” as the Son of Man, “is God.” There, accordingly, “headship” is simple lordship; the woman is subject to the man, the man is subject to Christ alone; Christ as the Son is subject to the Father. Here, on the other hand, we note, first, that in accordance with the general idea of the Epistle, the headship of Christ over the Church at large takes the place of His headship over the individual; next, that from the idea of His headship so conceived is derived the further idea of a spiritual unity, involving self-sacrifice in the head, as well as obedience to the head; and, lastly, that since the very idea of unity in Christ is unity with God, there is nothing to correspond to the third clause in the former Epistle.<p>(23, 24) <span class= "bld">And he is the saviour of the body. Therefore . . .</span>—The words “and” and “is” are wrongly inserted, and the word “therefore” is absolutely an error, evading the difficulty of the passage. It should be, <span class= "ital">He Himself being the Saviour of the Body. But</span> . . . This clause, in which the words “He Himself” are emphatic, notes (as if in order to guard against too literal acceptation of the comparison) that “Christ” (and He alone) is not only Head, but “Saviour of the Body,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“of His body the Church,” not only teaching and ruling it, but by His unity infusing into it the new life of justification and sanctification. Here no husband can be like Him, and therefore none can claim the absolute dependence of faith which is His of right. Accordingly St. Paul adds the word “But.” Though “this is so,” yet “still let the wives,” &c.<p><span class= "bld">As the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</span>—The subjection of the Church of Christ is a free subjection, arising out of faith in His absolute wisdom and goodness, and of love for His unspeakable love. Hence we gather (1) that the subordination of the wife is not that of the slave, by. compulsion and fear, but one which arises from and preserves freedom; next (2), that it can exist, or at any rate can endure, only on condition of superior wisdom and goodness and love in the husband; thirdly (3), that while it is like the higher subordination in kind, it cannot be equally perfect in degree—while it is real “in everything,” it can be absolute in nothing. The antitype is, as usual, greater than the type.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the husband is the head of the wife - see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.<p>As Christ is the head of the church - As Christ rules over the church, and has a right to direct and control it.<p>And he is the Saviour of the body - That is, of the church, represented as "his body;" see notes, <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. The idea here seems to be, that as Christ gave himself to save his body, the church; as he practiced self-denial and made it an object of intense solicitude to preserve that church, so ought the husband to manifest a similar solicitude to make his wife happy, and to save her from want, affliction, and pain. He ought to regard himself as her natural protector; as bound to anticipate and provide for her needs; as under obligation to comfort her in trial, even as Christ does the church.

If Paul had wished again to <span class="ital">infer</span>, from <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>, that which is <span class="ital">proved</span> by this verse, he would have written <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> or the metabatic <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span>.

According to Winer, p. 400 [E. T. 565], <a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.">Ephesians 5:24</a> is meant to continue and conclude the argument, so that <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a> proves the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς Τῷ ΚΥΡΊῼ</span></span></span> from the <span class="ital">position</span> of Christ and the husband, while <a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.">Ephesians 5:24</a> proves it from the <span class="ital">demand</span> implied in this position, and hence <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> amounts ultimately to the sense: “<span class="ital">but then</span>, which is the main thing.” But even in this way only a continuing <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, <span class="ital">autem</span>, and not the adversative <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, <span class="ital">at</span>, would be quite in accordance with the thought. When, moreover, it is assumed, with Rückert, Harless, Bleek, that <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, after the intermediate thought <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤῸς Ὁ ΣΩΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, is used as <span class="ital">breaking off</span> and leading back to the theme (see Hartung, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> II. p. 37), it is self-evident that the brief clause <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ὁ σωτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>.—introduced, moreover, only as apposition—has not at all interrupted the development, and consequently has not given occasion for such a leading back to the theme.[273] Hofmann finally takes <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> as repelling a possible objection, and to this effect: “<span class="ital">But even where the husband is not this</span> (namely, one who makes happy, as like Christ he ought to be) <span class="ital">to his wife, that subordination nevertheless remains</span>,” etc. But in this way the very thought, upon which everything is held to turn, is purely read into the passage. In view of all that has been said, I (and Schenkel agrees with me in this) cannot take <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ὁ σωτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. as apposition, but only as an independent proposition, and I understand <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> in its ordinary adversative sense, namely, thus: “<span class="ital">He</span> for His person, <span class="ital">He</span> and no other, <span class="ital">is the Saviour of the body; but</span> this relation, which belongs exclusively to Himself, does not take away the obligation of obedience on the part of the wives towards their husbands, nay, rather, <span class="ital">as the church obeys Christ, so must also the wives obey their husbands in every respect</span>.” The right view was already perceived by Calvin, when on account of the adversative <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> he proposed the explanation:[274] “Habet quidem id peculiare Christus, quod est servator ecclesiae, nihilominus sciant mulieres, sibi maritos praeesse, Christi exemplo, utcunque pari gratia non polleant.” Comp. also Bengel, who aptly remarks: “Vir autem non est servator uxoris; in eo Christus excellit; hinc <span class="ital">sed</span> sequitur.” … What Hofmann objects is quite irrelevant; for the thought, that Christ is Saviour of the body, is not <span class="ital">superfluous</span>, but has its significant bearing in the contrast which follows; and Paul had not to write <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώματος</span> with a view to clearness, since Christ was, in fact, just designated as <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span>; consequently nothing was now more natural and clear than the designation of believers by <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώματος</span>, the <span class="ital">correlative</span> of <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span>. The objection of Reiche, that <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> comes in <span class="ital">asyndetically</span>, can have no weight in the case of Paul especially, and of his brief and terse moral precepts (see immediately <a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a>, and comp. in particular <a href="/romans/12-9.htm" title="Let love be without dissimulation.

Incorrectly, since no reader could refer <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> to any other subject than to the one immediately preceding, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, and since it was intelligible to describe the church doubtless, but not the wife, as <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span> (without further addition). Nor is <span class="greekheb">σωτήρ</span> ever employed in the N.T. otherwise than of Christ or God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[272] For the view, that hereby a reminder is given to husbands of the fact, which is often forgotten by them, that they (see ver. 29) ought to make their wives truly happy (Erasm., Beza, Grotius, Estius, and others, including Rückert, Meier, Matthies, Baumgarten-Crusius; comp. also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 134 f.), is inadmissible, since the instructions for husbands begin only with ver. 25. Harless remarks: “Inasmuch as the apostle finds the obedience of marriage, realized in it by the wife, also in the relation of the church to Christ, he shows immediately the ground of this peculiar relation in the manifestation of the gracious <span class="ital">power</span> of the Lord by redemption.” But in this way the question as to the reason determining this addition is not answered, and the gracious power of the Lord is, in fact, not denoted by the simple <span class="greekheb">σωτήρ</span>. Olshausen (so already Piscator) thought that <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ὁ σωτὴρ τοῦ σώμ</span>. had merely the design of setting forth Christ more distinctly in the character of <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span>, inasmuch as it designates the church as the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> which He rules.

Reason for a wifely subjection of the kind indicated. It is found in the relation of headship. In the marriage union the husband holds the same relation, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that of headship, as Christ holds to the Church, and the headship of the one represents the headship of the other. For <span class="greekheb">ἐστι κεφαλὴ</span>, [605], Vulg., etc., give <span class="greekheb">κεφαλὴ ἐστιν</span>, which WH place in the margin. The <span class="greekheb">ὁ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἀνήρ</span> rests on the slenderest authority, and is omitted by LTTrWHRV on the testimony of [606] [607] [608] [609] [610] [611] [612], etc. The anarthrous <span class="greekheb">ἀνήρ</span> means “a husband” in the sense of any man belonging to the class of husbands. The article, again, is appropriate in <span class="greekheb">τῆς γυναικός</span>, as a definite relation is expressed there = “a husband is head of <span class="ital">his</span> wife”. The <span class="greekheb">ὡς καί</span> indicates the point common to the two subjects—each is <span class="ital">head</span>, though in relation to different objects.—[<span class="greekheb">καί</span>] <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span>] <span class="greekheb">σωτὴρ τοῦ σώματος</span>: <span class="ital">and He is Himself the Saviour of the body</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span> of the TR have considerable authority ([613]3[614]2, 3[615] [616] [617], most cursives, Syr., Arm., etc.); but they are not found in [618] [619] [620] [621] [622] [623], Vulg., etc., and are to be omitted (with LTTrWHRV). The clause then might be construed as in <span class="ital">apposition</span> to the previous <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, = “as Christ is the Head of the Church—He, the Saviour of the body”. But it is best taken as an <span class="ital">independent</span> clause, stating in a definite and emphatic way an important point in which Christ, who resembles the husband in respect of <span class="ital">headship</span>, at the same time <span class="ital">differs</span> from the husband. It is best rendered, therefore, “He, He Himself (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, = He alone) is the Saviour of the body”. The RV less happily makes it “being Himself the Saviour of the body”. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> can only be <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> is the <span class="ital">Church</span>—the body to which He brings salvation.
