He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28-29</a>. In exactly the same way our Lord quotes the same verse of Genesis (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) to show the indissoluble character of the marriage tie. Here the similarity of connection with that of the original passage is even stronger. Because a man’s wife is as his own body, “for this cause shall a man,” &c. To connect these words with those going before is indeed possible, but somewhat too mystical even for this passage.<p><span class= "bld">Shall a man leave his father . . .</span>—The relation of parentage is one of common flesh and blood, and stands at the head of those natural relations which we do not make, but into which we are born. The relation of marriage is the most sacred of all the ties into which we are not born, and which we do make for ourselves, in accordance with a true or supposed harmony of nature. It becomes, says Holy Scripture, a relation, not of common flesh and blood, but of “one flesh.” Itself originally voluntary, it supersedes all natural ties. Our Lord therefore adds, “They are no more twain, but one flesh. What God hath joined together let not man put asunder” (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm" title="Why they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.">Matthew 19:6</a>). Hence it strikingly represents that unity with Christ—voluntarily initiated by Him, voluntarily accepted by us—which yet so supersedes all natural ties that it is said to oblige a man to “hate his father and mother . . . and his own life also” (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause - &#x391;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  Anti toutou. This verse is a quotation from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, and contains the account of the institution of marriage. The meaning of the phrase rendered "for this cause" is, "answerably to this;" or corresponding to this - that is, to what Paul had just said of the union of believers and the Redeemer. On the meaning of this verse, see the notes on <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4</a>. There is no evidence that the marriage connection was originally designed to symbolize or typify this union, but it may be used to illustrate that connection, and to show the strength of the attachment between the Redeemer and his people. The comparison should be confined, however, strictly to the use made of it in the New Testament. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. For&#8212;The propagation of the Church from Christ, as that of Eve from Adam, is the foundation of the spiritual marriage. The natural marriage, wherein "a man leaves father and mother (the oldest manuscripts omit 'his') and is joined unto his wife," is not the principal thing meant here, but the spiritual marriage represented by it, and on which it rests, whereby Christ left the Father's bosom to woo to Himself the Church out of a lost world: Eph 5:32 proves this: His earthly mother as such, also, He holds in secondary account as compared with His spiritual Bride (Lu 2:48, 49; 8:19-21; 11:27, 28). He shall again leave His Father's abode to consummate the union (Mt 25:1-10; Re 19:7).<p>they two shall be one flesh&#8212;So the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, &c., read (Ge 2:24), instead of "they shall be one flesh." So Mt 19:5. In natural marriage, husband and wife combine the elements of one perfect human being: the one being incomplete without the other. So Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make the Church, the body, a necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head. He is the archetype of the Church, from whom and according to whom, as the pattern, she is formed. He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife (Ro 6:5; 1Co 11:3; 15:45). Christ will never allow any power to sever Himself and His bride, indissolubly joined (Mt 19:6; Joh 10:28, 29; 13:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For this cause; </span> because the woman was formed of the flesh and bones of the man.

What, however, is spoken, Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, of the union of husband and wife, Paul applies by typical interpretation to the coming (<span class="ital">future:</span> <span class="greekheb">καταλείψει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) union of Christ with the church (see <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>), a union which shall take place at the Parousia, up to which time the church is the <span class="ital">bride</span> of Christ, and at which it is then nuptially joined with Him (see on <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>),—and so the apostle expresses this antitype of the conjugal union in the hallowed words of Scripture, in which the type, the marriage union in the proper sense, is expressed. We have accordingly to explain it thus: <span class="ital">For this reason</span>, because we are Christ’s members, of His flesh and of His bone, <span class="ital">shall a man</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> antitypically, <span class="ital">Christ</span>, at the Parousia) <span class="ital">leave father and mother</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, according to the mystic interpretation of the apostle: He will leave His seat at the right hand of God) <span class="ital">and be united with his wife</span> (with the church), <span class="ital">and</span> (and then) <span class="ital">the two</span> (the man and the wife, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> Christ who has descended and the church) <span class="ital">shall be one flesh</span> (form one ethical person, as married persons by virtue of bodily union become a physical unity). Those expositors who, in keeping with the original sense of Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, take the words of <span class="ital">actual marriage</span> (so most expositors, including Matthies, Meier, Schenkel, Bleek, Rückert[287]), have against them as well the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤῚ ΤΟΎΤΟΥ</span></span></span>, which cannot be referred without arbitrariness to anything else than what immediately precedes, as also the <span class="ital">future</span> expression, which (as also in Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>) must denote something yet to come; and not less the statement of Paul himself, <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span> <span class="ital">must be</span> interpreted of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τὴν γυναῖκα</span> of the <span class="ital">church</span>, not merely <span class="ital">perhaps</span> (Reiche) is to be so interpreted. Hofmann likewise, II. 2, p. 139, understands it of real marriage, and sees all difficulties vanish if we more closely connect <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a> with <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>, so that <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο</span> sums up the Old Testament passage itself and makes this the subject, and then the sense is: “<span class="ital">That, as the passage affirms, the marriage communion is the most intimate of all communions for this reason, because the wife proceeds from the husband—this mystery, which was foreign to the Gentiles, is great. It is a highly significant mystery of the order laid down by the creation, a most important revelation of the divine counsel in this domain, which the apostle interprets as applying to Christ and the church, because marriage in this respect has its higher counterpart in the domain of redemption, but without excluding its validity also for the married as regards their relation regulated by the creation</span>.” This view is incorrect, for the very reason that to make <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον</span> be said in reference to the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> is quite foreign to, and remote from, the connection; because, further, Paul must have written <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δὲ νῦν λέγω</span>; because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> does not mean “I say <span class="ital">of</span> it,” but “I say <span class="ital">it</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> I <span class="ital">interpret</span> it; because <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τούτου</span> would remain entirely out of connection with that which precedes, and thus the passage of Scripture would make its appearance quite abruptly; because, if the reader was to understand the whole passage of Scripture as the subject, summed up in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΥΣΤΉΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, of what follows, the apostle must have indicated this, in order to be intelligible, by something like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΔῈ ἈΝΤῚ ΤΟΎΤΟΥ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ ΜΈΓΑ ἘΣΤΊΝ</span></span></span>; and because, finally, the validity of the fundamental law of marriage, <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>, for married persons is so entirely self-evident, that a quite unsuitable thought (“but without excluding,” etc.) is attributed to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΝ</span></span></span> of <a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm" title="Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.">Ephesians 5:33</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Those, further, <span class="ital">who explain it of Christ and the church</span>, as Hunnius, Balduin, Grotius, Bengel, Michaelis, and others, are mistaken in believing the connection with Christ already existing in the <span class="ital">present</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> as that which is meant; inasmuch as in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΛΕΊΨΕΙ ΤῸΝ ΠΑΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΗΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> they think of the <span class="ital">incarnation</span> (“etiam Christus patrem quasi reliquit,” Bengel), or generally of the fact that “Christus nihil tam carum habuit, quod non nostri causa abdicaverit” (Grotius), or even of the separation of Christ from His nation (Michaelis) or from the synagogue (Bisping); while Harless and Olshausen pass over <span class="greekheb">καταλείψει τὸν πατέρα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. without more precise explanation, as unessential to the connection and aim, and regard only <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἜΣΟΝΤΑΙ ΟἹ Δ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς Σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Μ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as the main point, explaining it of the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span>.[288] But the whole reference to the <span class="ital">already present</span> connection with Christ is incorrect, because <span class="ital">this</span> connection was just before expressed in the present form by <span class="greekheb">μέλη ἐσμὲν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but now upon this present relation is based the setting in of a future one (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΛΕΊΨΕΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; observe the <span class="ital">future</span> forms), and that by <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τούτου</span>, quite as in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a> by means of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΝΕΚΕΝ ΤΟΎΤΟΥ</span></span></span> the <span class="ital">future</span> relation of marriage is deduced from the then existing relation of Adam and Eve.

Moreover, the “<span class="ital">leaving</span>,” etc., does not at all suit the conception of the communion of Christ with believers in the Supper, and least of all the orthodox Lutheran conception of ubiquity. Nevertheless Kahnis (<span class="ital">Abendm</span>. p. 144) has entirely acceded to the view of Olshausen. He objects to the explanation of the union of Christ with the church at the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>, that this union cannot possibly be thought of as “a sacrificial renunciation, on the part of Christ, of His heavenly glory.” But the matter is neither so thought of nor so represented. That which is meant by <span class="greekheb">καταλείψει</span>, the coming again of Christ from heaven, will—and this was well known to the believing consciousness of every reader—take place not <span class="ital">without</span> His heavenly glory, but <span class="ital">with</span> that glory; and by the union, which is expressed in the typical representation <span class="greekheb">προσκολληθήσεται κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the <span class="greekheb">συνδοξασθῆναι</span> of the believers will then be accomplished. Comp. <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος</span> [<span class="greekheb">τὸν</span>] <span class="greekheb">πατέρα</span> [<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> [<span class="greekheb">τὴν</span>] <span class="greekheb">μητέρα</span>: <span class="ital">for this cause shall a man leave</span> [<span class="ital">his</span>] <span class="ital">father and mother</span>. Lachm. and Tregelles omit <span class="greekheb">τόν</span> and <span class="greekheb">τήν</span>; which are bracketed by WH. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is omitted by LTTrWHRV, as not supported by [689] [690] [691] [692]*[693], 17, Vulg., Arm., etc. It is found in [694]3[695] [696]3[697] [698] [699], Syr.-P., Boh., etc. These words, whether Paul gives them professedly as a <span class="ital">quotation</span> in a free form, or uses them directly, making them his own (Mey.), are substantially those which in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a> follow the statement regarding Eve as bone of Adam’s bone and flesh of his flesh. <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τούτου</span> corresponds to the <span class="greekheb">ἕνεκεν τούτου</span> of <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἀντί</span>, the prep. of <span class="ital">exchange</span> and <span class="ital">succession</span>, being used also, like the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">תַּחַת אֲשֶׁר</span>, in the sense of “for that,” and occasionally as = “wherefore”; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀνθʼ ὧν</span>, <a href="/luke/12-3.htm" title="Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the housetops.">Luke 12:3</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 125; Win.-Moult., p. 456. Thus <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τούτου</span> may refer either to the immediately preceding statement regarding our being <span class="ital">members of</span> Christ’s body (so Mey.), or to the leading idea of the previous verses, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the husband’s duty to love, nourish, and cherish the wife even as Christ loves, nourishes, and cherishes the Church. The former connection leads, as in Meyer’s case, to an allegorising interpretation. The latter is to be preferred as in harmony with a simpler and more natural view of what follows. Another turn is given to the phrase, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Von Soden, who makes it = “instead of this,” supposing the point to be that in place of <span class="ital">hating</span>, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm" title="For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:">Ephesians 5:29</a>, the husband ought to love and cleave to his wife. But this is far-fetched. The <span class="greekheb">καταλείψει</span>, especially in view of its application in the OT passage cited or used, must be taken here as the <span class="ital">ethical</span> future, the future expressing what <span class="ital">should, can</span>, or <span class="ital">must</span> be, as, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/matthew/7-26.htm" title="And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:">Matthew 7:26</a>; <a href="/luke/22-49.htm" title="When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?">Luke 22:49</a>; <a href="/john/6-68.htm" title="Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.">John 6:68</a>; <a href="/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a>, etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 348; Donaldson, <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, p. 407. Meyer insists on its being a <span class="ital">pure</span> future, and refers it to what is to take place at the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>. The verse as used here has been strangely handled by many commentators, who have found secondary, mystical meanings in the words. Not a few of the Fathers (Chrys., Theod., Theophyl., Jerome, etc.) interpreted it of the Incarnation; and late exegetes expounded it as referring in one way or other to Christ’s <span class="ital">present</span> connection with the Church (Grot., Beng., etc.); some understanding Christ’s separation from His <span class="ital">nation</span> (Mich.), or from the <span class="ital">synagogue</span>, to be indicated by the phrase “leave His Father,” and others even explaining it of the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span> (Harl., Olsh.). Alford applies it mystically to “that past, present, and future which constitutes Christ’s Union to His Bride, the Church—His leaving the Father’s bosom, which is <span class="ital">past</span>—His gradual preparation of the Union, which is <span class="ital">present</span>—His full consummation of it, which is <span class="ital">future</span>”. Even Meyer puts a forced, allegorical sense upon it, taking it to be used typically of the perfect union which takes place between Christ and the Church only at His Second Coming, before which time He is not Husband, but Bridegroom. So the <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span> becomes <span class="ital">Christ</span>, at the Parousia; the leaving father and mother becomes mystically Christ’s leaving His seat at the right hand of God; the two becoming <span class="ital">one flesh</span> is the descending, returning Christ making one ethical person with the Church, etc. But all this is in the highest degree unnatural. When Paul allegorises he gives intimation of the fact (<span class="greekheb">ἅτινά ἐστιν ἀλληγορούμενα</span>, <a href="/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24</a>), and certainly there is no such allegory as this would be anywhere else in the Pauline writings. Its incongruities condemn it. What is to be made, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of the leaving of the <span class="ital">mother</span>, which Jerome, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, is driven to say means the leaving of the heavenly Jerusalem? We take the verse, therefore, in its simple and obvious sense, as referring to the direct and ruling idea of the paragraph, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the natural marriage relation and the duty of husbands to wives; and we read it as an enforcement of that duty based upon the natural identity of the wife with the husband, as stated in the narrative of Creation and illustrated in its highest ideal in the Church’s relation to Christ.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ προσκολληθήσεται πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ δύο ἔσονται εἰς σάρκα μίαν</span>: <span class="ital">and shall cleave unto his wife, and the two shall become one flesh</span>. “Cleave to” represents very well the force of the verb <span class="greekheb">προσκολλάω</span>, the Sept. representative of <span class="greekheb">דָבַק</span>, <span class="ital">to glue to, stick to</span>. For <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα</span>, the reading of TR, with [700] [701]3[702]3[703] [704] [705], Orig., etc., <span class="greekheb">τῇ γυναικί</span> is given in [706] [707] [708] [709]*[710], etc., and is preferred by LTTr, while WH place it in the margin. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is omitted by T with [711]1, etc. For <span class="greekheb">προσκολληθήσεται</span> there is also the variant <span class="greekheb">κολληθήσεται</span> in [712]3[713]1[714], etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[689] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[690] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[691] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[692] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[693] Codex Boernerianus (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Dresden, edited by Matthæi in 1791.
