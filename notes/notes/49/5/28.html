Moreover, from this idea of the love of Christ as the pattern, the latter part of this verse and the following verses naturally arise. Christ loves the Church as His body, a part of Himself. Hence the idea that the husband is “the head of the wife” gives place to the absolute identification of himself with his wife, as “one flesh.”<p><span class= "bld">He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span>—All right “love of our neighbour” is directed to be given to him “as to ourselves.” It is to be of the same kind as the love of self—that is, first, an instinct (as of self-preservation); and next a rational and settled principle (as of reasonable self-love, seeking our own perfection, which is our happiness). Here, however, this love to our neighbour is actually identified with self-love. The wife is the husband’s very self; he can no more fail to love her than to love himself, though (again to follow the example of Christ) he may love her better than himself. We may note that this identification of husband and wife is the basis of all ecclesiastical, and, in great degree, of all civil, law of Christian nations as to marriage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself....">Ephesians 5:28-32</a></span>. But to return to the subject from which this pleasing digression has led us: <span class="ital">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies</span> — That is, as themselves, or a part of themselves; the bond of marriage making the husband and his wife one, and establishing an inseparable community of interests between them; so that the husband is to love his wife with the same sincerity and ardency of affection wherewith he loves himself. “The husband,” says Macknight, “whose love leads him, after Christ’s example, not only to protect and cherish his wife, by giving her the necessaries and conveniences of life, but also to <span class="ital">cleanse her; </span>that is, to form her mind, and assist her in making progress in virtue, really loves himself, and promotes his own happiness in the best manner. For his wife, being thus loved and cared for, will be strengthened for performing her duty; and her mind being improved, her conversation will give him the greater pleasure. Withal, having a high esteem for her husband, she will submit to the hardships of her inferior station with cheerfulness.” <span class="ital">No man</span> — In his senses; <span class="ital">ever yet hated his own flesh </span>— Whatever its infirmities or imperfections were; <span class="ital">but nourisheth and cherisheth it </span>— Feeds and clothes it; nay, and not only provides for its sustenance, but for its comfortable accommodation; <span class="ital">even as the Lord </span>nourishes and cherishes <span class="ital">the church </span>— Supplying it with all things that may conduce to its welfare and happiness, sympathizing with it in its infirmities, looking upon it as one with himself. <span class="ital">For </span>— He can say of his church what Adam said of Eve, when just taken out of his side, (<a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>,) <span class="ital">This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. </span>In other words, the reason why Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, is that close connection which subsists between him and her, his people being as intimately united to him, as if they were literally flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. <span class="ital">For this cause </span>— Because the woman is of the man’s flesh, and of his bones; <span class="ital">shall a man leave his father and mother</span> — To whom he was before united by the closest ties; <span class="ital">and shall be joined</span> <span class="ital">unto his wife </span>— Inseparably, till death shall part them; <span class="ital">and they — </span>Though originally and naturally two persons; <span class="ital">shall </span>— For the future; <span class="ital">be one flesh</span> — Shall be considered as one person, or as one soul in two bodies. <span class="ital">This is a great mystery </span>— A truth long unknown; and now, when in some measure discovered, is a matter worthy of much admiration. In the Vulgate version, this clause is translated, <span class="ital">Sacramentum hoc magnum est, This is a great sacrament. </span>And it is the sole foundation on which the Papists have set up marriage as a <span class="ital">sacrament. But I speak concerning Christ and the church </span>— That is, In saying this, you will easily perceive I speak not of the union between a man and his wife, but of that between Christ and the church: for that the eternal Son of God should unite himself to a society of degenerate and mortal men, should love them with an affection exceeding that which is to be found among the most intimate human relations, and should even regard them as making a part of himself, because of the intimacy with which they are joined to him in a community of spirit and of interest, can certainly never be sufficiently admired. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This seems to be the sense of the passage. Dr. Macknight, however, following Dr. Alix, Dr. Whitby, and several others, thinks that the apostle calls the formation of Eve from Adam’s body, his marriage with her, and the intimate union established between them by that marriage, <span class="ital">a great mystery, </span>because it contained an important emblematical meaning concerning the regeneration of believers, and their union with Christ, which [meaning] hitherto had been kept secret, but which he had discovered by applying Adam’s words concerning Eve, to Christ and his church; insinuating, by this application, “1st, That the formation of Eve, of a rib taken out of Adam’s body, was a figure of the regeneration of believers, by the breaking of Christ’s body, mentioned <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25</a>. 2d, That Adam’s love to Eve, on account of her being formed of his body, was a figure of Christ’s love to believers, because they are become his body, <a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>. 3d, That Adam’s marriage with Eve was a figure of the eternal union of Christ with believers in heaven, mentioned <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>. In giving this emblematical representation of these ancient facts, the apostle has not exceeded the bounds of probability. In the first age, neither the art of writing, nor any permanent method of conveying instruction being invented, it was necessary to make such striking actions and events as could not easily be forgotten, emblems of the instruction intended to be perpetuated. On this supposition, Adam, in whom the human race began, was a natural image of Christ, in whom the human race was to be restored; and his deep sleep, the opening of his side, and the formation of Eve of a rib taken out of his side, were fit emblems of Christ’s death, of the opening of his side on the cross, and of the regeneration of believers by his death. The love which Adam expressed toward Eve, and his union with her by marriage, were lively images of Christ’s love to believers, and of his eternal union with them in one society after their resurrection. And Eve herself, who was formed of a rib taken from Adam’s side, was a natural image of believers, who are regenerated, both in their bodies and in their minds, by the breaking of Christ’s side on the cross. Thus the circumstances which accompanied the formation of Eve, being fit emblems of the formation of the church, we may suppose they were brought to pass to prefigure that great event; and by prefiguring it, to show that it was decreed of God from the very beginning!” For a further elucidation of the subject, the reader must be referred to the above- mentioned commentator. We may add here, however, that Origen seems to have had some notion of the relation this passage had to Adam and Eve, when he says, “If any man deride us for using the example of Adam and Eve, when we treat of the knowledge of Christ, let him consider these words, <span class="ital">This is a great mystery.” </span>Tertullian also frequently alludes to the same thing, saying, <span class="ital">“This is a great sacrament: </span>Carnaliter in Adam, spiritualiter in Christo, propter spirituales nuptias Christi et ecclesiæ: carnally in Adam, spiritually in Christ, by reason of the spiritual marriage between him and his church.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies - Because they are one flesh; <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31</a>. This is the subject on which Paul had been speaking, and from which he had been diverted by the allusion to the glorified church. The doctrine here is, that a husband should have the same care for the comfort of his wife which he has for himself. He should regard her as one with himself; and as he protects his own body from cold and hunger, and, when sick and suffering, endeavors to restore it to health, so he should regard and treat her.<p>He that loveth his wife loveth himself - <p>(1) Because she is one with him, and their interests are identified.<p>(2) because, by this, he really promotes his own welfare, as much as he does when he takes care of his own body.

If a man wishes to promote his own happiness in the most effectual way, he had better begin by showing kindness to his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

We may add that Zanchius, who is followed by Estius and Harless,[280] is in error in saying, “digressus non nihil ad <span class="ital">mysterium</span>, nunc ad <span class="ital">institutum</span> redit.” There was no digression in what precedes, but a delineation of the love of Christ serving as an example for the husbands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς τὰ ἑαυτῶν σώματα</span>] not: <span class="ital">like</span> their own bodies,[281] but: <span class="ital">as</span> their own bodies.

Lachm. prefers the latter; TrWHRV the former. The TR, supported by [663] [664] [665], etc., omits <span class="greekheb">καί</span>; which is inserted, however, before <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄνδρες</span> by [666] [667] [668] [669] [670] 17, and most Versions, etc. It is accepted by TrRV, and is bracketed by WH. The <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> is taken by some (De Wette, etc.) to refer to the following <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, = “husbands ought to love their wives <span class="ital">just as</span> they love their own bodies”. To this there is no serious grammatical objection; for <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> does not look always to what precedes, but may refer to what follows (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὕτω δὲ ὡς διὰ πυρός</span>; also <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>). When this is the case, however, whether in classical Greek or in the NT, there appears to be a certain <span class="ital">emphasis</span> on the <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>, and its more familiar reference is to what precedes. Here, too, the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> favours the relation to the preceding <span class="greekheb">καθὼς καὶ ὁ χριστός</span>, etc. The idea, therefore, is that even as Christ loved the Church so too ought husbands to love their wives.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς τὰ ἑαυτῶν σώματα</span>: <span class="ital">as their own bodies</span>. This is not to be reduced to “like themselves” (Rosenm., etc.); nor does <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> here mean simply “like,” as if all that is meant is that the husband’s love for his wife is to be <span class="ital">similar</span> to his love for his own body. The <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> has its <span class="ital">qualitative</span> force, = “as it were,” “as being”. <span class="ital">Christ</span> and <span class="ital">husband</span> are each <span class="ital">head</span>, as Paul has already put it, and as the Church is the body in relation to the former, so is the wife in relation to the latter. The husband, the head, therefore, is to love the wife as being his body, even as Christ loved the Church as forming His body. The idea of husband and wife as being <span class="ital">one flesh</span> is probably also in view. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτὸν ἀγαπᾷ</span>: <span class="ital">he that loveth his own wife loveth himself</span>. The relation of <span class="ital">head</span> and <span class="ital">body</span> means that the wife is part of the husband’s <span class="ital">self</span>. To love his wife, therefore, in this character as being his body, is to love <span class="ital">himself</span>. It is a love, consequently, not merely of <span class="ital">duty</span>, but of <span class="ital">nature</span>—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ φύσιν</span> as well as <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὀφειλήν</span> (Ell.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[656] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[657] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[658] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[659] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.
