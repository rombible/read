The reason given that “the days are evil” must be taken in the widest sense, of all that induces temptation to swerve out of the “strictness” of the right way. The general lesson is that which is drawn by our Lord in the parable of the Unjust Steward—to apply the wisdom of the buyers and sellers of the world to the work of “the children of light.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Redeeming the time - The word rendered here as "redeeming," means "to purchase; to buy up" from the possession or power of anyone; and then to redeem, to set free - as from service or bondage; notes, <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. Here it means, to rescue or recover our time from waste; to improve it for great and important purposes.<p>Because the days are evil - Because the times in which you live are evil. There are many allurements and temptations that would lead you away from the proper improvement of time, and that would draw you into sin. Such were those that would tempt them to go to places of sinful indulgence and revelry where their time would be wasted, and worse than wasted. As these temptations abounded, they ought therefore to be more especially on their guard against a sinful and unprofitable waste of time. This exhortation may be addressed to all, and is applicable to all periods. The sentiment is, that we ought to be solicitous to improve our time to some useful purpose, because "there are, in an evil world, so many temptations to waste it." Time is given us for most valuable purposes. There are things enough to be done to occupy it all, and no one need have it hang heavy on his hands. He that has a soul to be saved from eternal death, need not have one idle moment. He that has a heaven to win, has enough to do to occupy all his time. Man has just enough given him to accomplish all the purposes which God designs, and God has not given him more than enough. They redeem their time who employ it:<p>(1) in gaining useful knowledge;<p>(2) in doing good to others;<p>(3) in employing it for the purpose of an honest livelihood for themselves and families;<p>(4) in prayer and self-examination to make the heart better;<p>(5) in seeking salvation, and in endeavoring to do the will of God.<p>They are to redeem time from all that would waste and destroy it - like recovering marshes and fens to make them rich meadows and vineyards. There is time enough wasted by each sinner to secure the salvation of the soul; time enough wasted to do all that is needful to be done to spread religion around the world, and to save the race. We should still endeavor to redeem our time for the same reasons which are suggested by the apostle - because the days are evil. There are evil influences abroad; allurements and vices that would waste time, and from which we should endeavor to rescue it. There are evil influences tending to waste time:<p>(1) in the allurements to pleasure and amusement in every place, and especially in cities;<p>(2) in the temptations to novel-reading, consuming the precious hours of probation to no valuable purpose;<p>(3) in the temptations of ambition, most of the time spent for which is wholly thrown away, for few gain the prize, and when gained, it is all a bauble, not worth the effort;<p>(4) in dissipation - for who can estimate the amount of valuable time that is worse than thrown away in the places of revelry and dissipation;<p>(5) in wild and visionary plans - temptations to which abound in all lands, and pre-eminently in our own;<p>(6) and in luxurious indulgence - in dressing, and eating, and drinking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Redeeming the time&#8212;(Col 4:5). Greek, "Buying up for yourselves the seasonable time" (whenever it occurs) of good to yourselves and to others. Buying off from the vanities of "them that are without" (Col 4:5), and of the "unwise" (here in Ephesians), the opportune time afforded to you for the work of God. In a narrower sense, special favorable seasons for good, occasionally presenting themselves, are referred to, of which believers ought diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true "wisdom" (Eph 5:15). In a larger sense, the whole season from the time that one is spiritually awakened, is to be "redeemed" from vanity for God (compare 2Co 6:2; 1Pe 4:2-4). "Redeem" implies the preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be bought at any price. Wahl explains, "Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing yourselves of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and commanding the time as a master does his servant." Tittmann, "Watch the time, and make it your own so as to control it; as merchants look out for opportunities, and accurately choose out the best goods; serve not the time, but command it, and it shall do what you approve." So Pindar [Pythia, 4.509], "The time followed him as his servant, and was not as a runaway slave."<p>because the days are evil&#8212;The days of life in general are so exposed to evil, as to make it necessary to make the most of the seasonable opportunity so long as it lasts (Eph 6:13; Ge 47:9; Ps 49:5; Ec 11:2; 12:1; Joh 12:35). Besides, there are many special evil days (in persecution, sickness, &c.) when the Christian is laid by in silence; therefore he needs the more to improve the seasonable times afforded to him (Am 5:13), which Paul perhaps alludes to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Redeeming the time; </span> or, buying the opportunity: a metaphor taken from merchants, that diligently observe the time for buying and selling, and easily part with their pleasure for gain; q.d.

Michaelis and Rosenmüller), which would be to revert, at variance with the context, to the topic of the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> already ended.

Similarly also Grotius (comp. Hammond): “quovis labore ac verborum honestis obsequiis vitate pericula et diem de die ducite.” Comp. Bengel, who compares <a href="/amos/5-13.htm" title="Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.">Amos 5:13</a>, and understands the prudent letting the evil day pass over “quiescendo vel certe modice agendo,” whereby the better time is <span class="ital">purchased</span>, in order to make the more use thereof. In opposition to Grotius and Bengel, it may be urged that this alleged mode of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξαγοράζειν τὸν καιρόν</span> is not mentioned by Paul, but imported by the expositor, and that the counsel of <span class="ital">such</span> a <span class="ital">trimming</span> behaviour is hardly compatible with the moral decision of the apostle, and with his expectation of the approaching end of the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼς οὗτος</span>.

According to de Wette’s here very unfounded scepticism, the writer is indistinct and hesitating, because he is bringing <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>. into another connection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[266] Who in earlier editions had rightly: <span class="ital">release the time</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm" title="Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.">Ephesians 5:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξαγοραζόμενοι τὸν καιρόν</span>: <span class="ital">buying up for yourselves the opportunity</span>. Definition of the <span class="greekheb">ὡς σοφοί</span>, specifying the way in which they were to give token of the quality of wisdom. The expression occurs only once again in the NT (in <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>); and there are but few proper parallels to it. The phrase as used in <a href="/daniel/2-8.htm" title="The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.">Daniel 2:8</a> has rather the sense of <span class="ital">gaining time, delaying</span>. The classical phrase <span class="greekheb">καιρὸν πρίασθαι</span> (used, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Demosthenes) has the plain meaning of purchasing for money. Even the <span class="greekheb">κερδαντέον τὸ παρόν</span> cited from Anton., vi., 26, and the <span class="greekheb">καιρὸν ἁρπάζειν</span> of Plut. (<span class="ital">Philop.</span>, 15) are but partial analogies. In the NT the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐξαγοράζειν</span> has at times the sense of <span class="ital">redeeming</span>, ransoming one from another by payment of a price, and so it is applied to Christ’s vicarious death (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>). It has the sense of <span class="ital">ransoming</span> occasionally in profane Greek (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Diodor., 36, 1, p. 530). Hence some take the idea here to be that of <span class="ital">redeeming</span>, as from the power of Satan (Calv.), or from the power of evil men (Beng.); the sacrifice of earthly things being taken by some (Chrys. Theophyl., Oec., etc.) to be the purchase-price. But it is doubtful whether any such technical or metaphorical sense can be attached to the word here, where the subject in view is the plain duty of a careful Christian walk. The simpler sense of <span class="ital">buying</span> is more appropriate to the context. The <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>- probably has its intensive force, although Ellicott takes it to refer merely to the “undefined time or circumstances, <span class="ital">out of</span> which, in each particular case, the <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span> is to be bought”. Giving the Middle also its proper sense, we get the sense of “buying up for yourselves”. The thing to be “bought up” is the <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span>, not “the time,” but “the <span class="ital">fit</span> time,” the “opportunity,” and the purchase-money implied in the figure is left undefined, but may be the <span class="ital">careful heed</span> expended on their walk. Thus the sense comes to be this—the character of wisdom by which their walk was to be distinguished was to show itself in the prompt and discerning zeal with which they made every opportunity their own, and suffered no fitting season for the fulfilment of Christian duty to pass unused. Luther’s “suit yourselves to the time” would require some such phrase as <span class="greekheb">δουλεύειν τῷ καιρῷ</span> (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>), and is otherwise inappropriate. Other explanations, such as Harless’s supposition that the matter in view is the fit time for letting the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> break in upon the darkness of sin, are remote from the immediate subject or impart ideas which are not in the text. The RV gives “redeeming the time” in the text, and “buying up the opportunity” in the margin.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι αἱ ἡμέραι πονηραί εἰσι</span>: <span class="ital">because the days are evil</span>. Statement of motive for buying up the opportunity, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the evil of the time. The context makes it clear that what is in view is the moral evil of the days, not merely as, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/genesis/47-9.htm" title="And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.">Genesis 47:9</a>, their difficulties and troubles (Beza, etc.). The fact that the times in which they lived were morally so corrupt was a strong reason for making every opportunity for good, which such times might offer, their own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">redeeming the time</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">buying out</span> (from other ownership) <span class="bld">the opportunity</span>. So <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>. The same phrase occurs (Aramaic and Greek) <a href="/daniel/2-8.htm" title="The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.">Daniel 2:8</a>; “I knew of a certainty that ye would <span class="ital">buy the time</span>”; where the meaning plainly is, “that ye would get your desired opportunity, <span class="ital">at the expense of</span> a subterfuge.” Here similarly the meaning is, “getting each successive opportunity of ‘walking and pleasing God’ <span class="ital">at the expense of</span> steady watchfulness.” In <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a> the special thought is of opportunities in intercourse with “them that are without.” So, perhaps, here also, in regard of <a href="/context/ephesians/5-12.htm" title="For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret....">Ephesians 5:12-14</a>.—Cp. <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>; where render “as we have <span class="ital">opportunity</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because the days are evil</span>] As if to say, “Make this sustained effort of getting opportunity; for it will be needed.

The days, says Paul, are evil, and are in the power of wicked men, not in your own power. Wherefore, since you see that you are hard pressed, endeavour, until the hostile intervals of this unhappy period pass away, to pass through and spend your time, if not with profit, at least without loss, which is done by keeping quiet, or at least by acting with moderation. This is the force of the verb <span class="greekheb">דמם </span>in a passage of Amos, which will be presently quoted. Wisdom and <span class="greekheb">ἀκρίβεια</span>, circumspection, are commanded, not sloth. There is however one mode of acting in summer, another in winter, even with greater labour [in the former than in the latter]. Those who in evil days seek meanwhile no fruit of time, but [the mere gaining of] time itself (according to the example of the Magi, Daniel 2, or like a besieged city waiting for assistance), these act wisely, and in the end will the better use the time, which they have thus redeemed (gained). Sirach 10 :(27) 31, <span class="greekheb">Μὴ δοξάζου ἐν καιρῷ στενοχωρίας σου</span>, boast not in the time of thy distress. A similar expression occurs in Polycarp’s Ep. to the church at Smyrna, where the martyrs are said, <span class="greekheb">διὰ μιᾶς ὥρας τὴν αἰώνιον κόλασιν ἐξαγοραζόμενοι</span>, to have bought off (gained exemption from) everlasting punishment by the sufferings of one hour.—§ 2. The opposite is to lose (throw away) time.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμέραι</span>, days) ch. <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πονηραὶ</span>, evil) <a href="/amos/5-13.htm" title="Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.">Amos 5:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ συνιῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ידם</span>) <span class="greekheb">σιωπήσεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι καιρὸς πονηρός ἐστιν</span>, he who has understanding at that time will be silent, because it is an evil time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil</span>; or, <span class="accented">buying up for yourselves the opportunity</span>, the idea being that of a merchant who, knowing the value of an article and the good use to which he can put it, buys it up. The opportunity is the opportunity of spreading the light and acting according to it; and the reason assigned, "because the days are evil," indicates that, owing to the prevalence of evil, there is much need for the light over which the Christian has control. It may be hinted likewise that the prevalence of evil is apt to cool the love and diminish the zeal of the Christian; hence the need for special eagerness of spirit in the matter - he must greedily watch for his opportunity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Redeeming the time (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>. </body></html>
