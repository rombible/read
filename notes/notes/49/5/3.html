At the same time, the constant connection of the two words suggests the truth which is conveyed by the union of the two kinds of “coveting” in the Tenth Commandment, viz., that the temper of selfish and unbridled concupiscence has a two-fold direction—to the covetousness of lust, and to the covetousness of avarice—the one perhaps especially a vice of youth, and the other of old age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;...">Ephesians 5:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">But fornication, </span>&c. — But any impure love, and any vice flowing therefrom, or connected therewith; <span class="ital">let it not be once named </span>— Or heard of; <span class="ital">among you </span>— Except with detestation.

These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But fornication - A "common" vice among the pagan then as it is now, and one into which they were in special danger of falling; see <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a> note; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> note.<p>And all uncleanness - Impurity of life; see the notes on <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>; compare <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>.<p>Or covetousness - The "connection" in which this word is found is remarkable. It is associated with the lowest and most debasing vices, and this, as well as those vices, was not once to be "named" among them. What was Paul's estimate then of covetousness? He considered it as an odious and abominable vice; a vice to be regarded in the same light as the most gross sin, and as wholly to be abhorred by all who bore the Christian name see <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>. The covetous man, according to Paul, is to be ranked with the sensual, and with idolaters <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>, and with those who are entirely excluded from the kingdom of God Is this the estimate in which the vice is held now? Is it the view which professing Christians take of it? Do we not feel that there is a "great" difference between a covetous man and a man of impure and licentious life? Why is this? Because:<p>(1) it is so common;<p>(2) because it is found among those who make pretensions to refinement and even religion;<p>(3) because it is not so easy to define what is covetousness, as it is to define impurity of life; and,<p>(4) because the public conscience is seared, and the mind blinded to the low and grovelling character of the sin.<p>Yet, is not the view of Paul the right view? Who is a covetous man? A man who, in the pursuit of gold, neglects his soul, his intellect, and his heart. A man who, in this insatiable pursuit, is regardless of justice, truth, charity, faith, prayer, peace, comfort, usefulness, conscience; and who shall say that there is any vice more debasing or degrading than this? The time "may" come, therefore, when the covetous man will be regarded as deserving the same rank in the public estimation with the most vicious, and when to covet will be considered as much opposed to the spirit of the gospel as any of the vices here named. When that time shall come, the world's conversion will probably be not a distant event.<p>Let it not be once named among you - That is, let it not exist; let there be no occasion for mentioning such a thing among you; let it be wholly unknown. This cannot mean that it is wrong to "mention" these vices for the purpose of rebuking them, or cautioning those in danger of committing them - for Paul himself in this manner mentions them here, and frequently elsewhere - but that they should not "exist" among them.<p>As becometh saints - As befits the character of Christians, who are regarded as holy.

"Uncleanness" and "covetousness" are taken up again from Eph 4:19. The two are so closely allied that the Greek for "covetousness" (pleonexia) is used sometimes in Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of impurity. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire with material objects of sense, outside of God.

The apostle proceeds to dehort from several vices, which are unbecoming the dear children and followers of God; and which the love of Christ should constrain them to avoid: the first of these, which is simple "fornication", is the sin which is committed between single or unmarried persons; and is contrary to the law of God, is a work of the flesh, and is against a man's own body; it renders persons unfit for church communion, brings many temporal calamities upon them, and exposes them to divine wrath, and excludes from the kingdom of heaven, without repentance; and the reason why it is so often taken notice of is, because it was very frequent among the Gentiles, and not thought criminal: "all uncleanness" takes in adultery, incest, sodomy, and every unnatural lust; and "covetousness" seems not so much to design that sin which is commonly so called, namely, an immoderate desire after worldly things, as a greedy and insatiable appetite after the above lusts: <p>let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; that is, neither one or other of them; the sense is, that they should not be committed; so that there might be no occasion to speak of them, even though with abhorrence, as if there were no such vices in being; and much less should they be named with pleasure, and pleaded for: for thus it becomes such who are set apart by God the Father, whose sins are expiated by the blood of Christ, and whose hearts are sanctified by the Spirit of God; who profess the Gospel of Christ, and have a place and a name in God's house, better than that of sons and daughters. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</span><p>(1) Now he comes to another type of affections, which is in that part of the mind which men call covetous or desirous: and he reprehends fornication, covetousness, and jesting very sharply.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] leading over to another portion of the exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> and <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>, quite as at <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>, the two main vices of heathendom.

The better order <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρασία πᾶσα</span> (LTTrWHRV) throws the emphasis on <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα</span>, = “fornication and uncleanness, every kind of it”. The metabatic <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> carries the exhortation over to a prohibition expressed in the strongest terms, which is levelled against one of the deadliest and most inveterate temptations to which Gentile Christians were exposed. The term <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> is to be taken in its proper sense and is not to be restricted to any one particular form—the license practised at heathen festivals, concubinage, marriage within prohibited degrees, or the like. The moral life of the Graeco-Roman world had sunk so low that, while protests against the prevailing corruption were never entirely wanting, fornication had long come to be regarded as a matter of moral indifference, and was indulged in without shame or scruple not only by the mass, but by philosophers and men of distinction who in other respects led exemplary lives.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ πλεονεξία</span>: <span class="ital">or covetousness</span>. Here, as in <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span> is named along with <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span>. In this passage, as in the former, most commentators take the two terms to designate two distinct forms of sin, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the two vices to which the ancient heathen world was most enslaved, immorality and greed; while some understand <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span> to be rather a further definition of <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> and give it the sense of <span class="ital">insatiability, inordinate affection, sensual</span> greed. The noun is found ten times in the NT and the verb <span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span> five times. In some of these occurrences <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span> can mean nothing else than <span class="ital">covetousness</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/luke/12-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.">Luke 12:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>). But the question is whether it has that sense in all the passages, or has taken on the acquired sense of <span class="ital">sensual</span> greed or overreaching in some of them. That is not very easy to decide. The association of the word <span class="greekheb">πλεονέκτης</span> with sins of the flesh (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world....">1 Corinthians 5:10-11</a>) is urged in favour of the latter application (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Trench, <span class="ital">Syn. of the N. T.</span>, p. 79). But it is argued with reason that the use of the disjunctive <span class="greekheb">ἢ</span> between <span class="greekheb">πόρνοις</span> and <span class="greekheb">πλεονέκταις</span> there and the connecting of <span class="greekheb">πλεονέκταις</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἅρπαξιν</span> by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> point to a distinction between the former two and an identity between the latter. So, too, in <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a> the noun <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξίαν</span> is differentiated from the <span class="greekheb">πορνείαν</span>, etc., by <span class="greekheb">τήν</span>. On the other hand, the passages in <a href="/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2 Peter 2:14</a> seem to suggest something more than <span class="ital">covetousness</span>, and it is also to be noticed that the original idea of these terms was that of having or taking an <span class="ital">advantage</span> over others. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a> the verb <span class="greekheb">πλέονεκτεῖν</span> is used along with <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαίνειν</span> in this sense, with reference to the sin of adultery. The present passage is probably the one, so far as Pauline use is concerned, that most favours the second sense, and it must be added that even the argument from the force of the disjunctive <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span> must not be made too much of. For in chap. <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a> we find <span class="greekheb">πόρνος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀκάθαρτος</span> connected by <span class="greekheb">ἣ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μηδὲ ὀνομαζέσθω ενὑμῖν</span>: <span class="ital">let it not be even named among you</span>. Cranm., Gen., Bish. render it “be once named”. The strong neg. <span class="greekheb">μηδέ</span> gives it this force—“Not to speak of doing such a thing, let it not be even so much as mentioned among you”. The partial parallel in <span class="ital">Herod.</span>, i., 138, <span class="greekheb">ἅσσα δὲ σφι ποιέειν οὐκ ἔξεστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα οὐδὲ λέγειν ἔξεστι</span>, is noticed here by most.—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς πρέπει ἁγίοις</span>: <span class="ital">as becometh saints</span>. The position of sainthood or separation to God, in which the Gospel places the Christian, is so far apart from the license of the world as to make it utterly incongruous even to speak of the inveterate sins of a corrupt heathenism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">but</span>] The word imports a sort of <span class="ital">a fortiori</span>.

See esp. <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Here as there the root idea is the grasp after another’s own, whatever it may be; money, person, wife. This passage, more perhaps than any other, suggests that the word had acquired by usage, in St Paul’s time, a familiar though not fixed connexion with <span class="ital">sensual</span> greed, just such as our word “covetousness” has acquired with the greed of material property. It would scarcely otherwise be used to denote an “unnamable” sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">once named</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">even named</span>; obviously in the sense of approving or tolerant mention. The Apostle himself here “names” these sins for exposure and condemnation; and Christians may need, on occasion, to do the same, and very explicitly. But let them beware that it is done in the spirit of Scripture—in self-distrust, and as in God’s presence.—For the phrase, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> gives a parallel, in the A.V.; but the word “<span class="ital">named</span>” is probably to be omitted there from the text. The resolve not to “name” the Gods of Canaan (<a href="/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a>) is parallel and illustrative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πορνεία</span>, <span class="ital">fornication</span>) impure <span class="ital">love</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ πλεονεξία</span>, <span class="ital">or covetousness</span>) <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, ch. <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μηδὲ ὀνομζέσθω</span>, <span class="ital">let it not be even named</span>) viz. as a thing (ever) done; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀκούεται</span>, <span class="ital">it is reported commonly</span> that, etc.; or (let it not be named) without necessity: comp. <a href="/context/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks....">Ephesians 5:4-12</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πρέπει</span>, <span class="ital">becomes</span>) Its opposite is <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀνήκοντα</span>, <span class="ital">which are not convenient</span> [<span class="ital">proper</span>], <a href="/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-21.</span> - THE WALK SUITABLE TO THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. Another of the remarkable contrasts of this Epistle; the fumes of lust are doubly odious in contact with the sweet savor of Christ's offering. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication and all impurity, or covetousness.</span> The combination of covetousness with sins of the flesh, occurring several times in the apostle's writings (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>), is rather unexpected. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, covetousness, means the desire of having more, which is peculiarly true of sensual sins; but it is not coupled with them by a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, but disjoined by an <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>, indicating something of another class. In the mind of the apostle, sensuality was inseparable from greed, unnatural craving for more, dissatisfaction with what was enough; hence the neighborhood of the two vices. <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be even named among you, as becometh saints.</span> The practice of such sins was out of the question; but even speaking of them, as matters of ordinary conversation, was unsuitable for saints; the very conversation of Christians must be pure. The exhortation bears on Christians in their social relations; had the apostle been treating of the duty of the individual, he would have urged that such sins should never be admitted even to the thoughts or the imagination. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Or covetousness<p>Or sets this sin emphatically by itself.<p>Let it<p>It refers to each of the sins. </body></html>
