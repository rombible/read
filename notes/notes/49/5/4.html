But the connection with the words following, and the distinction from those going before, appear to show that St. Paul here uses it for “filthy talking.” He is passing from impurity of the inward soul to impurity in outward expression. Of such foul speaking he appears to distinguish two forms. There is, first of all, “foolish talking,” or the talk of “the fool,” in the worst sense in which that word is used in Scripture (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>), as implying something worse than mere emptiness or blindness—describing the condition of the soul which has “lost its savour” (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>has ceased to distinguish what is right or wrong, wise or foolish, noble or base. There is then “jesting,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>properly, the more polished “versatility,” which will find occasion for wit or levity in anything, however sacred, fearing nothing so much as to be dull, and mistaking all seriousness and reserve for dulness. It is notable that in classical Greek the word is sometimes used in a good sense, as a mean between “churlishness” and “obsequiousness,” but yet hovers on the border of that condemnation which Christian gravity here pronounces unhesitatingly. The former kind of foul talking is coarse and brutal; the latter refined and deadly. Of both kinds Greek and Roman literature furnish specimens only too many and too striking.<p><span class= "bld">Which are not convenient.</span>—That is, “which are out of character” in a Christian—a milder repetition (perhaps suggested by the ambiguous meaning of “jesting” noted above) of the indignant declaration in <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>, that it “becomes not saints that these foul things should be even named among them.” They pollute the Christian mind and tongue even in condemning them.<p><span class= "bld">But rather giving of</span> <span class= "bld">thanks.</span>—The opposition is striking. “The foolish talking and jesting” aim at mirth and play of mind; St. Paul will not austerely condemn, such light-heartedness, but he finds a wholesome and spiritual vent for it in the habitual expression of thankfulness to God, which proceeds from a natural and childlike cheerfulness. Exactly in the same spirit below (<a href="/context/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18-20</a>) he contrasts the excitement of drunkenness with the being “filled with the Spirit . . . giving thanks always for all things.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither filthiness - That is, obscene, or indecent conversation. Literally, that which is shameful, or deformed - &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  aischrote&#772;s. The word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament.<p>Nor foolish talking - This word - &#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  mo&#772;rologia - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means that kind of talk which is insipid, senseless, stupid, foolish; which is not suited to instruct, edify, profit - the idle "chitchat" which is so common in the world. The meaning is, that Christians should aim to have their conversation sensible, serious, sincere - remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, "that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment;" <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>.<p>Nor jesting - &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  eutrapelia. This word occurs also nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, that which is "well-turned" &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;  eu - well, and &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;  trepo&#772; - to turn); and then that which is sportive, refined, courteous; and then "urbanity, humor, wit; and then jesting, levity" - which is evidently the meaning here. The apostle would not forbid courteousness, or refinement of manners (compare <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>), and the reference, therefore, must be to that which is light and trifling in conversation; to that which is known among us as jesting. It may be observed:<p>(1) that "courteousness" is not forbidden in the Scriptures, but is positively required; <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>.<p>(2) "Cheerfulness" is not forbidden - for if anything can make cheerful, it is the hope of heaven.<p>(3) "Pleasantry" cannot be forbidden. I mean that quiet and gentle humor that arises from good-nature, and that makes one good-natured in spite of himself.<p>Such are many of the poems of Cowper, and many of the essays of Addison in the "Spectator" - a benevolent humor which disposes us to smile, but not to be malignant; to be good-natured, but not to inspire levity. But levity and jesting, though often manifested by ministers and other Christians, are as inconsistent with true dignity as with the gospel. Where were they seen in the conversation of the Redeemer? Where in the writings of Paul?<p>Which are not convenient - That is, which are not fit or proper; which do not become the character of Christians; notes, <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>. Christians should be grave and serious - though cheerful and pleasant. They should feel that they have great interests at stake, and that the world has too. They are redeemed - not to make sport; purchased with precious blood - for other purposes than to make people laugh. They are soon to be in heaven - and a man who has any impressive sense of that will habitually feel that he has much else to do than to make people laugh. The true course of life is midway between moroseness and levity; sourness and lightness; harshness and jesting. Be benevolent, kind, cheerful, bland, courteous, but serious. Be solemn, thoughtful, deeply impressed with the presence of God and with eternal things, but pleasant, affable, and benignant. Think not a smile sinful; but think not levity and jesting harmless.<p>But rather giving of thanks - Thanks to God, or praises are more becoming Christians than jesting. The idea here seems to be, that such employment would be far more appropriate to the character of Christians, than idle, trifling, and indelicate conversation. Instead, therefore, of meeting together for low wit and jesting; for singing songs, and for the common discourse which often attends such "gatherings" of friends, Paul would have them come together for the purpose of praising God, and engaging in his service. Human beings are social in their nature; and it they do not assemble for good purposes, they will for bad ones. It is much more appropriate to the character of Christians to come together to sing praises to God, than to sing songs; to pray than to jest; to converse of the things of redemption than to tell anecdotes, and to devote the time to a contemplation of the world to come, than to trifles and nonsense. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. filthiness&#8212;obscenity in act or gesture.<p>foolish talking&#8212;the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together.

Nic.</span>, iv., 14), Pindar (<span class="ital">Pyth.</span>, i., 178), etc. It appears to have meant originally <span class="ital">versatility, facetiousness</span>, and to have acquired the evil sense of <span class="ital">frivolity</span> or <span class="ital">scurrility</span>. Here it is taken by some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Trench, Ell.) to be <span class="ital">distinguished</span> from <span class="greekheb">μωρολογία</span> and to denote, therefore, not the sin of the tongue merely, but the “evil ‘urbanitas’ (in manners or words) of the witty, godless man of the world” (Ell.). This depends so far on the acceptance of the disjunctive <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span> as the proper reading, but may be essentially correct. AV and other old English Versions give <span class="ital">jesting</span>, except Wicl., who has <span class="ital">harlotry</span>, and the Rhem. which gives <span class="ital">scurrility</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ οὐκ ἀνήκοντα</span>: <span class="ital">things which are not seemly</span>. The article has the pred. force = “<span class="ital">as</span> things which are not seemly” (Mey.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 610). The reading, however, varies. The TR is supported by the great mass of MSS—[515] [516] [517] [518], etc.; but [519] [520] [521] [522], etc., give <span class="greekheb">ἃ οὐκ ἀνῆκεν</span>, which is to be preferred. The clause is in apposition to the preceding; but probably only to the latter two nouns, <span class="greekheb">μωρολογία</span> and <span class="greekheb">εὐτραπελία</span>, as these form the direct contrast to the following <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστία</span>. <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ μὴ καθήκοντα</span> of <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον εὐχαριστία</span>: <span class="ital">but rather giving of thanks</span>. The brachylogy (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Jelf, <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, § 705, 3) requires <span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span> or rather <span class="greekheb">γίνεσθω</span> to be supplied. The <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστία</span> is understood by some to mean <span class="ital">gracious speech</span> (Clem. Al.; also Jer., with a <span class="ital">perhaps</span>), or <span class="ital">pious, edifying</span> discourse generally (Calv., on the analogy of <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm" title="The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.">Proverbs 11:6</a>). Others give it the sense of <span class="ital">courteous</span> speech (Mor.). But the idea of gracious speech would be expressed rather by <span class="greekheb">εὔχαρι</span>, and, as Meyer points out, the contrast which would thus result would be less in keeping with “the Christian character and the profoundly vivid piety of the Apostle”. On nothing does he more insist than on the grace of thankfulness, and the expression of it, to God for the gifts of His love to sinful men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[504] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[505] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[506] Codex Porphyrianus (sæc. ix.), at St. Petersburg, collated by Tischendorf.

It must have been everywhere the fashion at Ephesus. The passage does not deal with the play of humour and wit in general. This is not forbidden in Scripture, and so far as it is the outcome of vigour, gladness, or (in the case of humour) tenderness, it may be quite in harmony with the strict piety of the Gospel.

(Because) Aristotle considered jesting to be a virtue; and they made much use of Plautus.

From this original sense of versatility it came to be applied to morals, as timeserving, and to speech with the accompanying notion of dissimulation. Aristotle calls it chastened insolence. The sense of the word here is polished and witty speech as the instrument of sin; refinement and versatility without the flavor of Christian grace. "Sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in shrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute nonsense.... Sometimes an affected simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being.... Its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language" (Barrow, Sermon xiv., "Against Foolish Talking and Jesting." The whole passage is well worth reading). </body></html>
