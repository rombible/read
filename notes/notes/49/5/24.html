The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In everything - In everything which is not contrary to the will of God; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

For the <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ</span> of the TR, supported by [624]3[625] [626] and most cursives, read (with LTTrWHRV) <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, which is found in [627] [628] [629]*[630] [631], 17, 672, etc. But B omits it. The <span class="greekheb">ἰδίοις</span> inserted by TR (after [632] [633]3[634] [635] [636] and various Versions, etc.) before <span class="greekheb">ἀνδράσιν</span> is wanting in [637] [638] [639]*[640], 17, 672, etc., and should be deleted. It has crept in probably from <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22</a>. The question here is as to the force of the <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>. Some suppose a suppressed negation before it, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, “be not disobedient,” “do not disallow the marital headship, <span class="ital">but</span>,” etc. (Eadie). Others give it a resumptive force (Harl., etc.). But the supposed digression, which can only be the brief clause <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς σωτὴρ τοῦ σώματος</span>, requires no such resumption. Others give it a certain syllogistic force, understanding it to introduce a <span class="ital">proof</span> of the preceding statement, presenting the relation in a new light, or an inference from the statement (De Wette, Olsh.); but <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> does not draw <span class="ital">conclusions</span> like <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, nor is it = <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span>, although it may introduce a <span class="ital">minor proposition; cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 291; Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikl.</span>, ii., p. 384. Others make it = “<span class="ital">but then</span>, which is the main thing,” etc., supposing <a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.">Ephesians 5:24</a> to give a second proof of the fact that wives should be obedient to their husbands <span class="ital">as to the Lord</span>—a proof drawn from the position held by Christ and by the husband, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that of being <span class="ital">head</span> (Win.-Moult., p. 565). This, however, would be expressed rather by <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> than by <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, the former being the particle that in <span class="ital">opposing</span> also <span class="ital">continues</span> and <span class="ital">connects</span>, adding something distinct from what has preceded, while the latter has the full <span class="ital">opposing</span> significance, disannulling or discounting something mentioned before (Win.-Moult., p. 551). The <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, therefore, must have its full <span class="ital">adversative</span> force, and is best rendered “nevertheless,” “for all that”. The twenty-fourth verse thus looks to the peculiarity mentioned as belonging to Christ’s headship in distinction from the husband’s, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the fact that He is not only Head, but Saviour. And the idea becomes this—“Christ indeed is Saviour of the body, and that the husband is not; nevertheless the question of <span class="ital">obedience</span> is not affected thereby; for all that, as the Church is subject to Christ, so too are wives to be subject to their husbands” (so subst. Calv., Beng., Mey., Ell., Alf., etc.). In the <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> clause <span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσέσθωσαν</span>, “<span class="ital">let</span> the wives be subject,” as in RV text and according to most commentators, or better, <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσονται</span>, “so are the wives also” (as in RV marg.), is to be supplied from the preceding <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσεται</span>.
