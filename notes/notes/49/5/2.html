There is a similar connection of idea in <a href="/context/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12-13</a>, “This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” The imitation of God is in free and natural beneficence; the imitation of Christ is in that power of showing mercy, which is bought by suffering and sacrifice. He not only “loved us,” but “gave Himself for us.”<p><span class= "bld">An offering and a sacrifice to God,—</span>The same words, “sacrifice and offering,” are found in close connection in <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>, which is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>. Comparing these with the Hebrew words which they represent, and looking also to the etymology of the Greek words themselves, we see that the word “offering” signifies simply a gift offered to God, and is applied especially, though not exclusively, to unbloody sacrifices; while the word “sacrifice” distinctly implies the shedding of blood. Each word, when used alone, has constantly a more general sense. Thus “offering” is used in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>, for the sacrifice on the cross; while “sacrifice,” in <a href="/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>, is made to translate the word commonly rendered as “offering.” But when placed in juxtaposition they must be held distinctive; and hence we may conclude that our Lord made Himself “an offering” in the perfect obedience of His great humility, “coming to do God’s will” (according to the prophetic anticipation of <a href="/context/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7-8</a>), and gave Himself a “sacrifice,” when He completed that offering by shedding His blood on the cross. Both are said to be offered “for us,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on our behalf. We have, therefore, here a complete summary—all the more striking and characteristic because incidental—of the doctrine of the Atonement.<p><span class= "bld">For a sweet-smelling savour.</span>—The sense of this phrase is explained in <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Philippians 4:18</a> by the addition of the words “a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.” It is the translation of an expression, frequent in the Old Testament (as in <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm" title="And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Exodus 29:18</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>signifying “a smell of acquiescence” or “satisfaction.” It describes the atoning sacrifice as already accepted by God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, therefore be ye followers of God, imitators of God.

"And hath given himself for us." This is evidently added by the apostle to show what he meant by saying that Christ loved us, and what we ought to do to evince our love for each other. The strength of his love was so great that he was willing to give himself up to death on our account; our love for our brethren should be such that we would be willing to do the same thing for them; <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>.<p>An offering - The word used here - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;  prosphora - means properly that which is "offered to God" in any way; or whatever it may be. It is, however, in the Scriptures commonly used to denote an offering without blood - a thank-offering - and thus is distinguished from a sacrifice or a bloody oblation. The word occurs only in <a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>; <a href="/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>; <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>. It means here that he regarded himself as an offering to God.<p>And a sacrifice - &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  thusian. Christ is here expressly called a "Sacrifice" - the usual word in the Scriptures to denote a proper sacrifice. A sacrifice was an offering made to God by killing an animal and burning it on an altar, designed to make atonement for sin. It always implied the "killing" of the animal as an acknowledgment of the sinner that he deserved to die. It was the giving up of "life," which was supposed to reside in the "blood" (see the notes on <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), and hence it was necessary that "blood" should be shed. Christ was such a sacrifice; and his love was shown in his being willing that his blood should be shed to save people.<p>For a sweet-smelling savour - see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>, where the word "savor" is explained. The meaning here is, that the offering which Christ made of himself to God, was like the grateful and pleasant smell of "incense," that is, it was acceptable to him. It was an exhibition of benevolence with which he was pleased, and it gave him the opportunity of evincing his own benevolence in the salvation of people. The meaning of this in the connection here is that the offering which Christ made was one of "love." So, says Paul, do you love one another. Christ sacrificed himself by "love," and that sacrifice was acceptable to God. So do you show love one to another. Sacrifice everything which opposes it. and it will be acceptable to God. He will approve nil which is designed to promote love, as he approved the sacrifice which was made, under the influence of love, by his Son. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The offerer, and the offering that He offered, were one and the same (Joh 15:13; Ro 5:8).<p>offering and a sacrifice&#8212;"Offering" expresses generally His presenting Himself to the Father, as the Representative undertaking the cause of the whole of our lost race (Ps 40:6-8), including His life of obedience; though not excluding His offering of His body for us (Heb 10:10). It is usually an unbloody offering, in the more limited sense. "Sacrifice" refers to His death for us exclusively. Christ is here, in reference to Ps 40:6 (quoted again in Heb 10:5), represented as the antitype of all the offerings of the law, whether the unbloody or bloody, eucharistical or propitiatory.<p>for a sweet-smelling savour&#8212;Greek, "for an odor of a sweet smell," that is, God is well pleased with the offering on the ground of its sweetness,and so is reconciled to us (Eph 1:6; Mt 3:17; 2Co 5:18, 19; Heb 10:6-17). The ointment compounded of principal spices, poured upon Aaron's head, answers to the variety of the graces by which He was enabled to "offer Himself a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor." Another type, or prophecy by figure, was "the sweet savor" ("savor of rest," Margin) which God smelled in Noah's sacrifice (Ge 8:21). Again, as what Christ is, believers also are (1Jo 4:17), and ministers are: Paul says (2Co 2:17) "we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And walk in love; </span> let your whole conversation be in love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us; </span> viz. to die for us, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a></span>, as the greatest argument of his love, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a> <a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An offering and a sacrifice to God:</span> either <span class="ital">offering</span> signifies a meat-offering, which was joined as an appendix with the bloody sacrifice; or rather more generally, all the oblations that were under the law; and the word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sacrifice</span> either restrains it to those especially in which blood was shed for expiation of sin, or explains the meaning of it: q.d.

To God; to which the saints are obliged, not only by the law of God, which requires it, but by the goodness of God, and the discoveries of his love to them; and which shows itself in fearing to offend him, in a conformity to his will, in making his glory the chief end of all actions, and in loving all that belong to him: and also the saints should walk in love to Christ; who is to be loved fervently, constantly, in sincerity, with all the heart, and above all creatures and things; because of the loveliness of his person, the love he bears to them, and the things he has done for them, and the relations he stands in to them; and which is manifested in keeping his commands, in delighting in his presence, and in a concern at his absence: and also they should walk in love to one another, which is chiefly designed; which is Christ's new commandment, and is an evidence of regeneration; and without which a profession of religion is in vain: and to "walk" in love, is not merely to talk of it, but to exercise it; and to do all that is done for God, and Christ, and the saints, from a principle of love; and to advance, increase, and abound in it, and to go on and continue therein: the example to be copied after, and which carries in it an argument engaging to it is, <p>as Christ also hath loved us; with a love exceeding great and strong, which is wonderful, inconceivable, and unparalleled; and even as the Father has loved him; with a love that is free and sovereign, unchangeable and everlasting, of which he has given many instances; and a principal one is hereafter mentioned: the "as" here is a note of similitude, not of equality; for it cannot be thought that the saints should love God, or Christ, or one another, with a love equal to Christ's love to them, but only that theirs should bear some likeness to his: the Alexandrian copy and Ethiopic version, instead of "us", read "you": <p>and hath given himself for us; not the world, and the things of it, which are his; not men, nor angels, nor animals, but himself; he gave away his time, service, and strength; his name, fame, and reputation; all the comforts of life, and life itself; his whole human nature, soul and body, and that as in union with his divine person; and that not only for the good of his people, but in their room and stead; not for angels, nor for all men, but for his chosen ones, the church, his sheep, his people, and when they, were sinners; in the following manner, and for the said purpose: <p>an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour; Christ was both priest and sacrifice; he offered up himself a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of his people, to expiate them, and make reconciliation and satisfaction for them; and this he offered up to God, against whom they had sinned, and whose justice must be satisfied, who called him to this work, and engaged him in it; and which was well pleasing to him, he smelled a sweet savour of rest in it, it being an unblemished sacrifice, and voluntarily offered up; and was complete, full, and adequate to the demands of his justice; by it sin was put away, finished, and made an end of, and his people perfected for ever; see <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ περιπατεῖτε ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>: <span class="ital">and walk in love</span>.

But even in these the idea of substitution, which is properly expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀντί</span> (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>), is not in the <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> itself, although it may be in the context; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., pp. 434, 435; Mey. on <a href="/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; Ell. on <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">προσφορὰν καὶ θυσίαν τῷ Θεῷ</span>: <span class="ital">an offering and a sacrifice to God</span>. The primary idea in the whole statement is the love of Christ, and that love as shown in giving Himself up to death. This giving up of Himself to death is next defined in respect of its character and meaning, and this again with the immediate purpose of magnifying the love which is the main subject. The acc., therefore, is the <span class="ital">pred.</span> acc., = “as an offering”. The defining <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span>, as its position indicates, is best connected with the <span class="greekheb">προσφορὰν καὶ θυσίαν</span>; not with <span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν αὐτόν</span>, to which <span class="greekheb">εἰς θάνατον</span> is the natural supplement; nor with <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας</span>, for that would place <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span> in an <span class="ital">emphatic</span> position not easy to account for. The term <span class="greekheb">προσφορά</span> is used in the NT of offerings of all kinds, whether bloody or unbloody, whether of the <span class="ital">meal offering</span>, <span class="greekheb">מִנְחָה</span> (<a href="/hebrews/10-6.htm" title="In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.">Hebrews 10:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>), or of the bloody offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>) and the expiatory sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>). When it has the latter sense, it has usually some defining term attached to it (<span class="greekheb">περὶ ἁμαρτίας</span> (<a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>), <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώματος Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>)). The term <span class="greekheb">θυσία</span> in like manner is used for different kinds of offerings. In the LXX it represents both <span class="greekheb">מִנְחָה</span> and <span class="greekheb">זֶבַח</span>, and in the NT in such passages as <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>, etc., it is used generally. Sometimes it is applied to unbloody oblations (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>). Again (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm" title="For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,">Hebrews 10:26</a>) it is sin-offerings, expiatory offerings that are in view. The two terms, therefore, cannot in themselves be sharply distinguished, but they get their distinctive sense in each case from the context. Here, as in <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>, etc., it is possible that the two terms are used to cover the two great classes of offerings; in which case, as in <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-8.htm" title="I delight to do your will, O my God: yes, your law is within my heart.">Psalm 40:8</a>, the <span class="greekheb">θυσίαν</span> will refer to the sacrifice of slain beasts. If that is so, the sin-offering, or oblation presented with a view to the restoration of broken fellowship will be in view. And this is in accordance with the particular NT doctrine of Christ’s death as a <span class="ital">propitiation</span>, which has a distinct and unmistakable place in Paul’s Epistles, though not in his only (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1 John 4:10</a>), and a <span class="ital">reconciliation</span> (<a href="/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;...">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>), as well as with the OT view of sacrifice offered in order to effect forgiveness and removal of guilt (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm" title="And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-13.htm" title="And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he has sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.">Leviticus 5:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm" title="And he shall make amends for the harm that he has done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:16</a>, etc.).—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας</span>: <span class="ital">for a savour of sweet smell</span>.

The foundation of the phrase is of course the ancient idea that the smoke of the offerings rose to the nostrils of the god, and that in this way the Deity became partaker of the oblation along with the worshipper (Hom., <span class="ital">Il.</span>, xxiv., 69, 70). The phrase was naturally used oftenest of the burnt offering (Lev. 2:9, 13, 17), and some have argued that there is nothing more in view here than the idea of self-dedication contained in that offering. But the phrase is used also of the expiatory offering (<a href="/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[489] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[490] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[491] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

Thus we may safely interpret in the light of Scripture at large, and of the next following words here. But the business of this passage is with the Lord’s Example, and it does not enter in detail into His Sacrificial work, nor employ (in the Gr.) the strict formula for substitution, such as the Lord Himself uses, <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, “to give His soul a <span class="ital">Ransom in place, instead, of</span> many.” The supreme Act of self-devoting love for others which, as a fact, the Atoning Death was, is here used as the great Example of all acts of self-devoting love in the Christian Church. As the Father has just been named as the Ideal for the forgiving Christian, so here the Son is named as the Ideal for the self-sacrificing Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Hath given</span>”:—better, as R.V., <span class="bld">gave Himself up</span>, to the agents of death.—“<span class="ital">For us</span>” = “on behalf of us,” not here (see first paragraph of this note) “in place of us.” The phrase is the less precise and more inclusive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">offering … sacrifice</span>] Both Gr. nouns have a large and general meaning in many places and thus often “overlap” each other; but where, as here, they occur together we must look for some limit and distinction. “Offering” is, on the whole, the more general word, “sacrifice” the more particular. “Offering” gives the thought of dedication and surrender at large to God’s purposes; “sacrifice” gives that of such surrender carried out in altar-death. Not that “sacrifice” necessarily implies death, but death is its very frequent connexion. Bp Ellicott here sees in “offering” a suggestion of the obedience of the Lord’s life, in “sacrifice,” of His atoning death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a sweet-smelling savour</span>] The same Gr. occurs <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a> (A. V. “an odour of a sweet smell”). It occurs often in the LXX. of the Pentateuch; <span class="ital">e.g</span>. <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a>; and see esp. <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm" title="But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-13.htm" title="But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-17.htm" title="And he shall split it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:17</a>, where the reference is to <span class="ital">atoning</span> sacrifices (see <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>). It translates the Heb. <span class="ital">rêach nîchôach</span>, “a savour of rest.” In the picture language of typical sacrifices, the savour was “smelt” by the Deity as a welcome token of worship and submission, and thus it conveyed the thought of pacification and acceptance. Pagan sacrificial language has many parallels; see, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Homer, <span class="ital">Il.</span> 1. 317, viii. 549. Cowper renders the last passage<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Next the Gods<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With sacrifice they sought, and from the plain<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upwafted by the wind, the smoke aspires,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Savoury, but unacceptable to those<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Above, such hatred in their hearts they bore” &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Lord’s obedience and atonement “reconciled the Father unto us” (Art. ii.), in that they perfectly met the unalterable demand of the holy and broken Law.

"For us," not merely on our behalf, but in our room (after verbs of giving, dying, etc.); this, indeed, being implied in the idea immediately following of a <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, which, alike to the Jewish and pagan mind, conveyed the idea of a life given in room of another. <span class="cmt_word">An offering and a sacrifice to God.</span> Offering and sacrifice are nearly synonymous, but the first probably includes the whole earthly career of Christ incarnate - his holy life, blessed example, gracious teaching, loving companionship, as well as his atoning death, which last is more precisely the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, sacrifice. The offering and sacrifice were presented to God, to satisfy his justice, fulfill the demands of his law, and glorify his holy and righteous government. <span class="cmt_word">For a sweet-smelling savor.</span> Allusion to Noah's sacrifice of every clean beast and of every fowl - " the Lord smelled a sweet savor;" that is, the whole transaction, not the offering merely, but the spirit in which it was offered likewise, was grateful to God. The whole work of Christ, and the beautiful spirit in which he offered himself, were grateful to the Father, and procure saving blessings for all who by faith make the offering their own. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Walk in love<p>As imitators of God who is love.<p>Loved us (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The correct reading is &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; you.<p>Gave (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>To death Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>, where the same verb was delivered is followed by was raised.
