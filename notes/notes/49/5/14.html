Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">James 4:6</a>) in <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a> to introduce a scriptural quotation; and the most natural completion of the elliptical expression is by the supply of the nominative, “God,” or “the scripture,” from the ordinary phrase of quotation or citation. But no scriptural passage can be adduced which, with the fullest allowance for the apostolic freedom of quotation, comes near enough to be a satisfactory original of this passage. The nearest is <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>, “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee;” and this is certainly very far off indeed. Nor is the case much helped by blending other passages (as, for example, <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>) with this. Some additional verbal coincidences may be gained, but at the expense of still greater diversity from the spirit of the passage as a whole. Hence we are driven to conclude that the quotation is not from Holy Scripture. Yet the very form shows that it is from something well known. An apocryphal quotation is imagined by some, but with no knowledge of any quotation at all resembling it. Others have supposed it a traditional saying of our Lord (like <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>); but the form seems decisive against this. On the whole, it seems most likely that it is from some well-known Christian hymn. In the original a rhythmical character, rough, but by no means indistinct, strikes us at once. The growth of defined and formal expressions—mostly, it is true, of embryo creeds of Christian faith, as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1Corinthians 15:3-4</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, in the last of which the acknowledged difficulty of etymological construction in the true reading may perhaps be best explained by the supposition of quotation—is notable in the later Epistles, and especially in the “faithful sayings” of the Pastoral Epistles. The use of some liturgical forms is traced with high probability to a very early date. The embodiment of popular faith in hymns, always natural, was peculiarly natural as adapted to the imperfect education of many early converts, and to the practice of trusting so much to memory, and so comparatively little to writing. Some such usage certainly appears to be referred to in the celebrated letter of Pliny to Trajan, the first heathen description of Christian worship.<p><span class= "bld">Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.</span>—The word “awake” is used in our version to render two different words: one which properly means “to wake,” or “be awake,” or “watch,” as in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-34.htm" title="Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.">1Corinthians 15:34</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.">1Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>); the other, as here, which properly means “Up!” “Rouse thyself!” preparatory to “arising” and coming forth. The exhortation in both forms is common enough (see especially the famous passage in <a href="/context/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.">Romans 13:11-14</a>); but the following words, “Arise from the dead,” are a bold and unique exhortation. Generally we are said to be raised up from the death of sin by God, as in <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>, “He that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies;” or <a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>, “Reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God;” or <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>, “If ye are risen in Christ.” Here the soul is described as hearing the Saviour’s call, “Come forth,” and as itself rising at that call from the grave. If distinction between the two clauses is to be drawn, we may be rightly said to “awake” out of lethargy and carelessness, and to “arise” out of the deadness of sin.<p><span class= "bld">Christ shall give thee light.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">Christ shall dawn upon thee.</span> The word is virtually the same which is used for the literal dawn in <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm" title="In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.">Matthew 28:1</a>, <a href="/luke/23-54.htm" title="And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.">Luke 23:54</a>. The same idea is strikingly enunciated in <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>, where prophecy, looking forward to Christ, is compared to “a light shining in a dark place,” “till the day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your hearts”—He, that is, who is “the bright and morning star” (<a href="/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.">Revelation 22:16</a>). Christ, as the “Day-star,” or as the “Sun of Righteousness,” is already risen. The soul needs only to come out of the darkness of the grave, and the new rays shine down upon it, till (see <a href="/ephesians/5-7.htm" title="Be not you therefore partakers with them.">Ephesians 5:7</a>) they pervade it and transfigure it into light.<p>(3 <span class= "ital">c.</span>) In <a href="/context/ephesians/5-15.htm" title="See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,">Ephesians 5:15-21</a> the Apostle passes from lust and impurity to the cognate spirit of reckless levity, and the love of excitement, of which drunkenness is the commonest expression. He opposes to this the united forces of soberness and sacred enthusiasm, each tempering and yet strengthening the other.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore he saith - Margin, or "it." &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  Dio legei. The meaning may be, either that the Lord says, or the Scripture. Much difficulty has been experienced in endeavoring to ascertain "where" this is said. It is agreed on all hands that it is not found, in so many words, in the Old Testament. Some have supposed that the allusion is to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, "Thy dead men shall live - awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs," etc. But the objections to this are obvious and conclusive.<p>(1) this is not a quotation of that place, nor has it a "resemblance" to it, except in the word "awake."<p>(2) the passage in Isaiah refers to a different matter, and has a different sense altogether; see the notes on the passage.<p>To make it refer to those to whom the gospel comes, is most forced and unnatural. Others have supposed that the reference is to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, "Arise, shine; for thy light is come," etc. But the objection to this is not less decisive.<p>(1) it is "not" a quotation of that passage, and the resemblance is very remote, if it can be seen at all.<p>(2) "that" is addressed to the church, calling on her to let her light shine; "this," to awake and arise from the dead, with the assurance that Christ would give them light. The exhortation here is to Christians, to "avoid the vices of the pagan around them;" the exhortation in Isaiah is to the church, to "rejoice and exult" in view of the fact that the day of triumph had come, and that the pagan were to be converted, and to come in multitudes and devote themselves to God. In the "design" of the two passages there is no resemblance. Some have supposed that the words are taken from some book among the Hebrews which is now lost. Epiphanius supposed that it was a quotation from a prophecy of Elijah; Syncellus and Euthalius, from some writing of Jeremiah; Hippolytus, from the writing of some now unknown prophet. Jerome supposed it was taken from some apocryphal writings. Grotius supposes that it refers to the word "light" in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a>, and that the sense is," That light says; that is, that a man who is pervaded by that light, let him so say to another." Heumann, and after him Storr, Michaelis, and Jennings (Jewish Ant. 2:252), suppose that the reference is to a song or hymn that was sung by the early Christians, beginning in this manner, arid that the meaning is, "Wherefore, as it is said in the hymns which we sing,<p>'Awake, thou that sleepest;<p>Arise from the dead;<p>Christ shall give thee light.'<p>Others have supposed that there is an allusion to a sentiment which prevailed among the Jews, respecting the significancy of blowing the trumpet on the first day of the month, or the feast of the new moon. Maimonides conjectures that that call of the trumpet, especially in the month Tisri, in which the great day of atonement occurred, was designed to signify a special call to repentance; meaning, "You who sleep, arouse from your slumbers; search and try yourselves; think on your Creator, repent, and attend to the salvation of the soul." "Burder," in Ros. Alt. u. neu. Morgenland, in loc. But all this is evidently conjecture. I see no evidence that Paul meant to make a quotation at all. Why may we not suppose that he speaks as an inspired man, and that he means to say, simply, that God now gives this command, or that God now speaks in this way? The sense then would be, "Be separate from sinners. Come out from among the pagan. Do not mingle with their abominations; do not name them. You are the children of light; and God says to you, awake from false security, rouse from the death of sin, and Christ shall enlighten you." Whatever be the origin of the sentiment in this verse, it is worthy of inspiration, and accords with all that is elsewhere said in the Scriptures.<p>(The grand objection to this view of our author is, that the apostle evidently introduces a citation. In the writings of Paul, the form &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  dio legei is never used in any other sense. Whence then is the quotation taken? There is nothing absurd in supposing, with Scott and Guyse, that the apostle gives the general sense of the Old Testament prophecies con cerning the calling of the Gentiles. But <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, bears a sufficiently close resemblance to the passage in Ephesians, to vindicate the very commonly received opinion, that the apostle quotes that prophecy, in which the subject is the increase of the Church by the accession of the pagan nations. The church is called to arise and shine, and the apostle reminds the converted Ephesians of their lofty vocation. It forms no very serious objection, that between the place in Isaiah and that in Ephesians, there are certain verbal discrepancies. No one will make much of this, who remembers, nat in a multitude of cases similar variations occur, the apostles contenting themselves with giving the sense of the places to which they refer. "Accordingly," says Dr. Dodridge, "the sense of tire passage before us is so fairly deducible from the words of Isaiah, that I do not see any necessity of having recourse to this supposition," namely, that the quotation was from an apocryphal book ascribed to Jeremiah.)<p>Awake thou that sleepest - Arouse from a state of slumber and false security. "Sleep and death" are striking representations of the state in which people are by nature. In "sleep" we are, though living, insensible to any danger that may be near; we are unconscious of what may he going on around us; we hear not the voice of our friends; we see not the beauty of the grove or the landscape; we are forgetful of our real character and condition. So With the sinner. It is as if his faculties were locked in a deep slumber. He hears not when God calls; he has no sense of danger; he is insensible to the beauties and glories of the heavenly world; he is forgetful of his true character and condition. To see all this, he must be first awakened; and hence this solemn command is addressed to man. He must rouse from this condition, or he cannot be saved. But can he awaken himself? Is it not the work of God to awaken a sinner? Can he rouse himself to a sense of his condition and danger? How do we do in other things? The man that is sleeping on the verge of a dangerous precipice we would approach, and say, "Awake, you are in danger." The child that is sleeping quietly in its bed, while the flames are bursting into the room, we would rouse, and say, "Awake, or you will perish." Why not use the same language to the sinner slumbering on the verge of ruin, in a deep sleep, while the flames of wrath are kindling around him? We have no difficulty in calling on sleepers elsewhere to awake when in danger; how can we have any difficulty when speaking to the sinner?<p>And arise from the dead - The state of the sinner, is often compared to death; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>. People are by nature dead in sins; yet they must rouse from this condition, or they will perish. How singular, it may be said, to call upon the dead to rise! How could they raise themselves up? Yet God speak thus to people, and commands them to rise from the death of sin. Therefore, learn:<p>(1) That people are not dead in sin in any such sense that they are not moral agents, or responsible.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Wherefore&#8212;referring to the whole foregoing argument (Eph 5:8, 11, 13). Seeing that light (spiritual) dispels the pre-existing darkness, He (God) saith &#8230; (compare the same phrase, Eph 4:8).<p>Awake&#8212;The reading of all the oldest manuscripts is "Up!" or, "Rouse thee!" a phrase used in stirring men to activity. The words are a paraphrase of Isa 60:1, 2, not an exact quotation. The word "Christ," shows that in quoting the prophecy, he views it in the light thrown on it by its Gospel fulfilment. As Israel is called on to "awake" from its previous state of "darkness" and "death" (Isa 59:10; 60:2), for that her Light is come; so the Church, and each individual is similarly called to awake. Believers are called on to "awake" out of sleep; unbelievers, to "arise" from the dead (compare Mt 25:5; Ro 13:11; 1Th 5:6, with Eph 2:1).<p>Christ&#8212;"the true light," "the Sun of righteousness."<p>give thee light&#8212;rather, as Greek, "shall shine upon thee" (so enabling thee by being "made manifest" to become, and be, by the very fact, "light," Eph 5:13; then being so "enlightened," Eph 1:18, thou shalt be able, by "reproving," to enlighten others).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He saith; </span> either God by the prophets, of whose preaching this is the sum; it may allude in particular to <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a></span>.

According to Rückert (comp.

Inexact, and—inasmuch as with Plutarch <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">λυποῦντες</span> stand in emphatic correlation, and <span class="greekheb">λυποῦντες</span> thus is essential—inappropriate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>] introduces, with the supplying of <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> (as <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>), <span class="ital">a passage of Scripture</span>, of which the Hebrew words would run: <span class="greekheb">עוּרָה יָשֵׁן וְהָקִיצָה מִן־הַמֵּתִים וְהֵאִיר לְךָ מָשִׁיחַ</span>. But what passage is that? Already Jerome says: “Nunquam hoc scriptum reperi.” Most expositors answer: <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>. So Thomas, Cajetanus, Calvin, Piscator, Estius, Calovius, Surenhusius, Wolf, Wetstein, Bengel,[263] and others, including Harless and Olshausen; while others at the same time bring in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a> (Beza, Calixtus, Clericus, Meier, Baumgarten-Crusius, and others), as also <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a> (Schenkel) and <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.">Isaiah 9:1</a> (Baumgarten, Holzhausen). But all these passages are so essentially different from ours, that we cannot with unbiassed judgment discover the latter in any of them, and should have to hold our citation—if it is assumed to contain Old Testament words—as a mingling of Old Testament reminiscences, nothing similar to which is met with, even apart from the fact that this citation bears in itself the living impress of unity and originality; hence the less is there room to get out of the difficulty by means of Bengel’s expedient: “apostolus expressius loquitur ex luce N.T.” Doubtless Harless says that the apostle was here concerned not about the <span class="ital">word</span>, but about the matter in general, and that he cites the word of pre-announcement with the modification which it has itself undergone through fulfilment, and adduces by way of analogy <a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a> ff. But in opposition to this may be urged, first generally, that <span class="ital">such</span> a modification of <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a> would have been not a mere modification, but would have quite done away with the identity of the passage; secondly, in particular, that the passage <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>, specially according to the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">φωτίζου</span>, <span class="greekheb">φωτίζου Ἰηρουσαλὴμ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἥκει γάρ σου τὸ φῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ δόξα κυρίου ἐπὶ σὲ ἀνατέταλκεν</span>), needed no change whatever in order to serve for the intended Scriptural confirmation, for which, moreover, various other passages from the O. T. would have stood at the command of the apostle, without needing any change; and lastly, that <a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a> is not analogous, because there the identity with <a href="/context/deuteronomy/30-12.htm" title="It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?...">Deuteronomy 30:12-14</a> is unmistakeably evident <span class="ital">in the words themselves</span>, and the additions <span class="ital">concerning Christ</span> are not there given as constituent parts of the <span class="ital">Scripture utterance</span>, but expressly indicated as elucidations <span class="ital">of the apostle</span> (by means of <span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστι</span>). Quite baseless is the view of de Wette, that the author is quoting, as at <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a> (where, indeed, the citation is quite undoubted), an O. T. passage in an application which, by frequency of use, has become so familiar to him that he is no longer precisely conscious of the distinction between text and application. <span class="ital">Others</span>, including Morus, have discovered here a quotation from an <span class="ital">apocryphal book</span>, under which character Epiphanius names the prophecy of <span class="ital">Elias</span>, Georgius Syncellus an <span class="ital">apocryphal</span> authority of <span class="ital">Jeremiah</span>, and Godex G on the margin, the book (“Secretum”) of <span class="ital">Enoch</span>. See, in general, Fabricius, <span class="ital">Cod. Pseudepigr. V. T</span>. pp. 1074, 1105; <span class="ital">Apocr. N.T.</span> I. p. 524. That, however, Paul <span class="ital">wittingly</span> cited an apocryphal book,[264] is to be decisively rejected, inasmuch as this is never done by him, but, on the contrary, the formula of citation always means canonical passages. Hence, also, we have not, with Heumann (<span class="ital">Poicile</span>, II. p. 390), Michaelis, Storr, Stolz, Flatt, to guess at an <span class="ital">early hymn of the Church</span> as the source.[265] <span class="ital">Others</span> have found therein a saying of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, like Oeder in <span class="ital">Syntagm. Obss. sacr</span>. p. 697 ff., in opposition to which may be urged, not indeed the following <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, which Jesus might doubtless have said of Himself, but rather the fact that the subject <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΕΙ</span></span></span> could not be at all divined, as indeed Paul has never adduced sayings of Christ in his Epistles. This also in opposition to the opinion mentioned in Jerome (comp. also Bugenhagen and Calixtus), that Paul here, after the manner of the prophets (comp. the prophetic: <span class="ital">thus saith the Lord</span>), “<span class="greekheb">προσωποποιΐαν</span> Spiritus sancti figuraverit.” Grotius (comp. Koppe) regards even <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ Φῶς</span></span></span> as subject: “<span class="ital">Lux illa</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">homo luce perfusus, dicit alteri</span>.” As if previously the <span class="greekheb">φῶς</span> were <span class="ital">homo luce perfusus!</span> and as if every reader could not but have recognised a citation as well in <span class="greekheb">διὸ λέγει</span> as in the character of the saying itself! Erroneously Bornemann also, <span class="ital">Schol. in Luc</span>. p. xlviii. f., holds that <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> is to be taken <span class="ital">impersonaliter; in this respect it is said, one may say</span>, so that no passage of Scripture is cited, but perhaps allusion is made to <a href="/mark/5-41.htm" title="And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.">Mark 5:41</a>. This impersonal use is found only with <span class="greekheb">φησί</span>. See the instances cited by Bornemann, and Bernhardy, p. 419. In view of all these opinions, my conclusion, as at <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>, is to this effect: From <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙῸ ΛΈΓΕΙ</span></span></span> it is evident that Paul <span class="ital">desired</span> to adduce a passage of <span class="ital">canonical</span> Scripture, but—as the passage is not canonical—in virtue of a <span class="ital">lapsus memoriae</span> he adduces an <span class="ital">apocryphal</span> saying, which, citing from memory, he held as canonical.

See Jerome. The words themselves: Christ shall <span class="ital">shine upon</span> thee, signify not: <span class="ital">He will be gracious to thee</span> (so, at variance with the context, Bretschneider), but: He will by the gracious operation of His Spirit annul in thee the ethical darkness (<span class="greekheb">λύων τὴν νύκτα τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span>, Gregory of Nazianzus), and impart to thee the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span>, of which He is the possessor and bearer (Christ, the <span class="ital">light</span> of the world).

The clause as we have it means not merely “Christ will cause His face to shine graciously upon thee,” but “Christ will shine upon thee with the light of His truth and bring thee out of the pagan darkness of ignorance and immorality”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[549] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[550] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[551] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

But whence does the passage come? The answer which first suggests itself, and which is given by many (Calv., Est., Beng., Harl., Olsh., Hofm., Weiss, Alf., Ell., etc.), is that it is a quotation from the OT, as the formula <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> indicates, and in fact a very free reproduction and application of <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>. The difficulty lies in the extreme freedom with which the original words are handled. There is but a very slender resemblance between what we have here and the LXX version of the prophetic verse, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, <span class="greekheb">φωτίζου</span>, <span class="greekheb">φωτίζου</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰερουσαλήμ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἥκει γάρ σου τὸ φῶς καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐπί σε ἀνατέταλκεν</span>. Nor should we have a different condition, if we supposed Paul in this case to have followed the Hebrew text. Hence some (Beza, etc.) imagine that Paul has combined with <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a> other Isaianic passages (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.">Isaiah 9:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a>). But while it is true that Paul does elsewhere use great liberty in modifying, combining, and applying OT passages, it cannot be said either that these words of Isaiah have much relation to the quotation, or that we have in Paul’s writings (even <a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a>, etc., not excepted) any case quite parallel to this. Others, therefore, conclude that the passage is from some apocryphal writing, the <span class="ital">Apocalypse of Elias</span> (Epiph.), a prophecy under the name of <span class="ital">Jeremiah</span> (Geor. Syncell.), one of the writings attributed to <span class="ital">Enoch</span> (Cod. [557], margin). But though Paul <span class="ital">might</span> have quoted from an apocryphal book, and some think he has done it, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>, it is certain that his habit is to quote only from the OT, and further this formula of citation appears always to introduce an OT passage. Meyer tries to solve the difficulty by the somewhat far-fetched supposition that Paul really quoted from some apocryphal writing, but by a lapse of memory took it for a part of canonical Scripture. Others suggest that he is quoting a saying of our Lord not recorded in the Gospels (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Resch., <span class="ital">Agrapha</span>, pp. 222, 289), or a <span class="ital">baptismal formula</span>, or some <span class="ital">hymn</span> (Mich., Storr, etc.). The choice must be between the first-mentioned explanation and the last. Notwithstanding the confessed difficulties of the case, there is not a little to incline us to the idea that, although in a very inexact and unusual form, we have a biblical quotation before us here. On the other hand it is urged (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Haupt) with some force that the rhythmical character of the passage favours the supposition that we have here a snatch from some very ancient hymn or liturgical composition. The question must be confessed to be still open. But what in any case is the <span class="ital">point</span> of the quotation here? The passage is introduced in connection with the reference to the <span class="ital">effects</span> of a faithful <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξεις</span> and under the impression of the figure of the <span class="ital">light</span>. It takes the form of an appeal to wake out of the pagan condition of sin, described by the two-fold figure of <span class="ital">sleep</span> and <span class="ital">death</span>, and of a promise that then Christ will shine upon the sinner with the saving light of His truth. The quotation comes in relevantly, therefore, as a further enforcement both of the need for the <span class="ital">reproof</span> which is enjoined, and of the good effects of such a <span class="ital">reproof</span> faithfully exercised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[557] Codex Boernerianus (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Dresden, edited by Matthæi in 1791.

St Jerome, on the verse, makes many suggestions; as that St Paul may have used an “apocryphal” passage, exactly as he used words from pagan writers (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>); or that he utters an immediate inspiration granted to himself, in prophetic form. Thomas Aquinas (quoted by Vallarsius on St Jerome) suggests that we have here the <span class="ital">essence</span> of <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>; where the Lat. reads “Rise, be enlightened, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come &c.” Surely this is the true solution, if we add to it the probability that other prophecies <span class="ital">contributed</span> to the phraseology here. Dr Kay (in the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>) on <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a> writes, “In <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a> this verse is combined, in a paraphrase form, with <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean....">Isaiah 52:1-2</a>.

Therefore they were to <span class="ital">awake</span> (ch. <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a>) out of sleep, and <span class="ital">arise</span> from the dead, that Christ the Lord might <span class="ital">shine upon</span> them, and they again shed His light on the Gentiles round.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To the believer in the Divine plan and coherence of Scripture it will be abundantly credible that “the Lord” (Jehovah) of Isaiah should be the “Christ” of St Paul (cp. <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a> with <a href="/john/12-41.htm" title="These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.">John 12:41</a>), and that the “Jerusalem” of Isaiah should have an inner reference to the True Israel (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>), in its actual or potential members.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dr Edersheim (<span class="ital">Temple and its Services</span>, p. 262), suggests that the Apostle may have had present to his mind language used in synagogue worship at the Feast of Trumpets. Rabbinic writers explain the trumpet blasts as, <span class="ital">inter alia</span>, a call to repentance; and one of them words the call, “Rouse ye from your slumber, awake from your sleep, &c.” Some such formula may have been in public use. Bengel makes a similar suggestion here. But this would not exclude, only supplement, the reference to Isaiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another suggestion is that the words are a primitive Christian “psalm” (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>); perhaps “the morning hymn used each day by the Christians in Rome in St Paul’s lodging,” or “a baptismal hymn.” Here again we have an interesting possibility, for such a “psalm” may have given or influenced the phrase here. But the introductory word “<span class="ital">He</span>, or <span class="ital">it, saith</span>,” seems to us to weigh decidedly for the view that the words are, in essence, a Scripture quotation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sleepest</span> … <span class="ital">the dead</span>] The sleep is more than sleep; the sleep <span class="ital">of death</span>. But death itself is but as sleep that can be broken (<a href="/matthew/9-24.htm" title="He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.">Matthew 9:24</a>) to the Lord of Life. On spiritual death see above, on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall give thee light</span>] Better, as R.V., <span class="bld">shall shine upon thee</span>.—The idea, by context, is not so much of the light of conviction, as of that of spiritual transfiguration (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them....">2 Corinthians 4:4-6</a>). The thought of “<span class="ital">being light in the Lord</span>” runs through the passage. It is a light consequent <span class="ital">upon</span> awaking and arising.—Another, but certainly mistaken, reading gives, “<span class="ital">thou shalt touch Christ</span>” The “Old Latin” followed it. It is due, in part at least, to the close similarity in form of two widely different Gr. verbs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὸ λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">Wherefore He says</span>) The chief part of this exhortation is in <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">φωτίζου φωτίζου</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἥκει γάρ σου τὸ φῶς</span>, Heb. <span class="greekheb">קומי אורי</span>; so ibid. <a href="/context/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean....">Isaiah 52:1-2</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξεγείρου</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀνάστηθι</span>. But the apostle speaks more expressly in accordance with (out of) the light of the New Testament, and according to the state of him who requires to be awakened. At the same time he seems to have had in his mind the particular phraseology which had been ordinarily used at the feast of trumpets: Arise, Arise out of your sleep; awake from your sleep, ye who deal in vain things, for very heavy sleep is sent to you; see Hotting. ad Godw., p. 601. And perhaps he wrote this epistle at that time of the year: comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened.

There is no difficulty with the formula, "he saith," which, like the same expression in <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>, is clearly to be referred to God. But no such words occur in the Old Testament. The passage that comes nearest to them is <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>," Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord hath risen upon thee." The simplest and best explanation is, not that the apostle quoted from any lost book, but flint he did not mean to give the words, but only the spirit of the passage. This is evident from his introducing the word "Christ." It must be owned that the apostle makes a very free use of the prophet's words. But the fundamental idea in the prophecy is, that when the Church gets the light of heaven, she is not to lie still, as it' she were asleep or dead, but is to be active, is to make use of the light, is to use it for illuminating the world. The apostle maintains that the Ephesian Church had got the light of heaven; she, therefore, was not to sleep or loiter, but spring forth as if from the grave, and pour light on the world. The changes which the apostle makes on the form of the prophecy are remarkable, and show that it was to its spirit and substance rather than to its precise form and letter that he attached the authority of inspiration. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He saith<p>God.
