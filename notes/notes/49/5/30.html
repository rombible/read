The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are members of his body - Of the body of Christ; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>, notes, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>, note. The idea here is, that there is a close and intimate union between the Christian and the Saviour - a union so intimate that they may be spoken of as "one".<p>Of his flesh, and of his bones - There is an allusion here evidently to the language which Adam used respecting Eve. "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh;" <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>. It is language which is employed to denote the closeness of the marriage relation, and which Paul applies to the connection between Christ and his people. Of course, it cannot be understood "literally." It is not true literally that our bones are a part of the bones of Christ, or our flesh of his flesh; nor should language ever be used that would imply a miraculous union. It is not a physical union, but a union of attachment; of feeling; of love. If we avoid the notion of a "physical" union, however, it is scarcely possible to use too strong language in describing the union of believers with the Lord Jesus. The Scriptures make use of language which is stronger than that employed to describe any other connection; and there is no union of affection so powerful as that which binds the Christian to the Saviour. So strong is it, that he is willing for it to forsake father, mother, and home; to leave his country, and to abandon his possessions; to go to distant lands and dwell among barbarians to make the Redeemer known; or to go to the cross or the stake from simple love to the Saviour. Account for it as people may, there has been manifested on earth nowhere else so strong an attachment as that which binds the Christian to the cross. It is stronger love that that which a man has for his own flesh and bones; for it makes him willing that his flesh should be consumed by fire, or his bones broken on the wheel rather than deny him. Can the infidel account for this strength of attachment on any other principle than that it has a divine origin?<p>(See the supplementary note, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, on the union between Christ and his people, in which it is shown that a mere union of feeling and love is far beneath the truth.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. For&#8212;Greek, "Because" (1Co 6:15). Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh with Him. Translate, "Because we are members of His body (His literal body), being OF His flesh and of His bones" [Alford] (Ge 2:23, 24). The Greek expresses, "Being formed out of" or "of the substance of His flesh." Adam's deep sleep, wherein Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church. Joh 12:24; 19:34, 35, to which Eph 5:25-27 allude, as implying atonement by His blood, and sanctification by the "water," answering to that which flowed from His side (compare also Joh 7:38, 39; 1Co 6:11). As Adam gave Eve a new name, Hebrew, "Isha," "woman," formed from his own rib, Ish, "man," signifying her formation from him, so Christ, Re 2:17; 3:12. Ge 2:21, 23, 24 puts the bones first because the reference there is to the natural structure. But Paul is referring to the flesh of Christ. It is not our bones and flesh, but "we" that are spiritually propagated (in our soul and spirit now, and in the body hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and bones. We are members of His glorified body (Joh 6:53). The two oldest existing manuscripts, and Coptic or Memphitic version, omit "of His flesh and of His bones"; the words may have crept into the text through the Margin from Ge 2:23, Septuagint. However, Iren&aelig;us, 294, and the old Latin and Vulgate versions, with some good old manuscripts, have them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We are members of his body; </span> his mystical body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of his flesh, and of his bones; </span> as Eve was of Adam’s, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a></span>; only that was in a carnal way, this in a spiritual, as by the communication of Christ’s flesh and blood to us by the Spirit we are united to him, and members of him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ephesians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we are members of his body,....

This form of expression is a reminiscence of <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>,[283] where Adam expresses the origin of Eve out of his bones and out of his flesh,[284]—to which origin the derivative relation of Christians to Christ is analogous, of course not physically, but in the spiritual, mystical sense, <span class="ital">inasmuch as the Christian existence as such—the specific being and spiritual nature of Christians—proceeds from Christ, has in Christ its principle of origination</span>, as in a physical manner Eve proceeded from Adam. The at any rate non-literal expressions are not intended to bear minuter interpretation. They do not affirm that believers are produced and taken out of Christ’s glorified body (Gess, <span class="ital">Person Christi</span>, p. 274 ff.; comp. Bisping), which is already forbidden by the expression “flesh and bones.” Rather is the same thing intended—only brought, in accordance with the connection, into the definite sensuously genetic form of presentation suggested by Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>—which elsewhere is denoted by <span class="greekheb">καινὴ κτίσις</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), as well as by <span class="greekheb">ζῶ δὲ οὐκέτι ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ Χριστός</span> (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), by <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸν ἐνεδύσασθε</span> (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>), by the relation of the <span class="greekheb">ἓν πνεῦμα εἶναι</span> to Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>), and in general by the expressions setting forth the Christian <span class="greekheb">παλιγγενεσία</span>.[285] Comp. the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΙΝΩΝῸΝ ΓΊΝΕΣΘΑΙ ΘΕΊΑς ΦΎΣΕΩς</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2 Peter 1:4</a>. With various modifications it has been explained of the <span class="ital">spiritual origination from Christ</span> already by Chrysostom (who understood the regeneration by baptism), Ambrosiaster, Theodoret, Oecumenius (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθὸ ἀπαρχὴ ἡμῶν ἐστι τῆς δευτέρας πλάσεως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ Ἀδὰμ διὰ τὴν πρώτην</span>), Theophylact, Erasmus, Beza, Vorstius (“spirituali tantum ratione ex ipso Christo quasi procreatos esse”), Calvin (“qui spiritus sui virtute nos in corpus suum inserit, ut vitam ex eo hauriamus”), Calovius, Bengel, Matthies, de Wette (who, however, in the second edition, regards the words as spurious), Hofmann, Reiche, and others; while, withal, Koppe (so also Meier) thought only <span class="ital">arctissimam quamlibet conjunctionem</span> to be denoted, whereby justice is not done to the genetic signification of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>. Others explained it: <span class="ital">in so far as we have the same human nature as He</span>. So Irenaeus, Jerome, Augustine, Thomas, Michaelis; comp. also Stolz and Rosenmüller. Decidedly erroneous, partly because Paul could not in this sense say: “we are of Christ’s flesh and bone,” but only the converse: “Christ is of our flesh and bone” (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); partly because the element of having like nature with Christ would apply not merely to Christians, but to men as such generally. Others refer it to the <span class="ital">crucifixion of Christ:</span> “ex carne ejus et ossibus <span class="ital">crucifixis</span>, i.e. ex passione ejus predicata et credita ortum habuit ecclesia,” Grotius. Comp. already Cajetanus, as also Zanchius, Zachariae, Schenkel, having reference to <a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a> f., <a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a> ff. But the <span class="ital">crucifixis</span> is purely imported, and could the less be guessed here, inasmuch as from the words the history of Adam and Eve inevitably came to be recalled; and there is nothing to remind us (in opposition to Schenkel) of the “martyr-stake of the cross,” upon which Christ “<span class="ital">gave up</span>” His flesh and bones “and suffered them <span class="ital">to be broken</span>” (? see <a href="/john/19-33.htm" title="But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:">John 19:33</a>; <a href="/john/19-36.htm" title="For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.">John 19:36</a>). Others, finally, have explained it <span class="ital">of the real communion with the body of Christ in the Lord’s Supper</span>. So recently,[286] in addition to Kahnis and Thomasius, III. 2, p. 73, also Harless and Olshausen, the latter of whom says: “it is the self-communication of His divine-human nature, by which Christ makes us to be His flesh and bone; He gives His people His flesh to eat and His blood to drink.” But not even the <span class="ital">semblance</span> of a plea for explaining it of the Supper lies in the words; since Paul has not written <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ</span>, which would have been <span class="ital">specific</span> in the case of the Supper, but <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ</span>! Rückert has renounced any attempt at explanation, and doubts whether Paul himself thought of anything definite in the words. A very needless <span class="ital">despair</span> of exegesis!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[283] This reminiscence the more readily suggested itself to the apostle, not only in general, because he was wont to think of Christ as the second Adam (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a> ff.), but also specially because he was just treating of the subject of <span class="ital">marriage</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[284] That Paul should not prefix <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>, but <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς σαρκός</span>, was quite naturally suggested to him by ver. 29. The explanation of Bengel is arbitrary and far-fetched.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[285] Philo also, p. 1094, applies the words of Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span> to a <span class="ital">spiritual</span> relation—to the relation of the soul to God. If the soul were better and more like God, it would be able to make use of those words, because, namely, it <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐστὶν ἀλλοτρία αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ σφόδρα οἰκεῖα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[286] Many of the older expositors, following Theodoret and Theophylact, at least mixed up the Supper in various ways in their interpretation. So Beza and Calvin say that it is <span class="ital">obsignatio et symbolum</span> of the mystic fellowship with Christ here meant. Grotius found an <span class="ital">allusion</span> to the Supper; while, on the other hand, Calovius maintained that we were <span class="ital">ex Christo</span> not only by regeneration, but also by the communication of His body and blood in the Lord’s Supper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μέλη ἐσμὲν τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">for we are members of His body</span>. The <span class="greekheb">μέλη</span>, which is the heart of the statement, has the emphatic position. We are not something apart from Christ, nor do we occupy only an accidental relation to Him. We are veritable parts of that body of which He is head, and this is the reason why He nourishes and cherishes the Church; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the detailed description in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ....">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">being of His flesh and of His bones</span>. This sentence, which is added by the TR, has considerable documentary testimony—[679] [680] [681] [682] [683] [684], most cursives, such Versions as the Syr. and the Arm., and such Fathers as Iren., Jer., etc. If it is retained, as is done by Mey., Ell., Reiche, Alf., etc., it will be an explanation of the affirmation that we are <span class="greekheb">μέλη τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ</span>, drawn from the thought of our <span class="ital">origin</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>). We are <span class="ital">members</span> of Christ’s body, as having the source of our spiritual being in Him. This statement of our <span class="ital">spiritual origin</span> is expressed in terms like those used of the origin of our physical life, the allusion being probably to the record of the formation of Eve in <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>. As the first woman derived her physical being from Adam in the way there recorded, so we Christians draw our spiritual being from Christ. The evidence, however, is decidedly adverse, the clause not appearing in [685] [686] [687] [688], 17, 672, Boh., Eth., Method., Euthal., Origen (prob.), etc. The internal evidence may be said to be against it, in so far, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, as a new figure is suddenly introduced, the statement is carried beyond the idea of <span class="ital">relationship</span>, and no clear or congruous meaning can be readily attached to the new terms, <span class="ital">flesh</span> and <span class="ital">bones</span>. Nor is it easy in face of evidence so old and so various to suppose that the words were mistakenly omitted by homœoteleuton. The clause, therefore, is deleted from the <span class="ital">text</span> by LTTrWHRV; Tr., however, giving it a place on the margin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[679] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[680] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[681] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[682] Codex Boernerianus (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Dresden, edited by Matthæi in 1791.

(AB<span class="greekheb">א</span>) supported by other but not considerable authority, omit these words. It has been suggested that they were inserted by transcribers from <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>, as the next verse is certainly quoted from <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>. But the phrase here is not verbally close enough to that in Gen. to make this likely. A transcriber would probably have given word for word, while the Apostle would as probably quote with a difference, such as we find here. And the difference is significant. “We” are not said here to be “bone of His bone &c.,” which might have seemed to imply that our physical frame is derived from that of the Incarnate Lord, but, more generally, “limbs of His body, <span class="bld">out of His flesh and out of His bones</span>.” Our true, spiritual, life and being is the derivative of His as He is our Second Adam, in a sense so strong and real as to be figured by the physical derivation of Eve from Adam. “As for any mixture of the substance of His flesh with ours,” says Hooker (<span class="ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> v. 56, end), “the participation which we have of Christ includeth no such gross surmise[40]”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] The remarkable chapter which thus closes deserves very careful study. It will be seen that Hooker’s view of “Christ’s body in ours as a cause of immortality” is that it is “a cause by removing, through the <span class="ital">death and merit</span> of His own flesh, that which hindered the life of ours.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In brief, this statement, in the light of other Scripture, amounts to the assertion that “we,” the believing Church, as such, are, as in the Case of Eve and Adam, at once the product of our Incarnate Lord’s existence as Second Adam, and His Bride. This profound and precious truth is not dwelt upon, however. Strictly speaking, it is only incidental here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">because</span>) The reason why the Lord nourishes and cherishes the Church, is the very close relationship, which is here expressed in the words of Moses regarding Eve, accommodated to the present subject. The Church is propagated from Christ, as Eve was from Adam; and this propagation is the foundation of the spiritual marriage: <span class="ital">for this cause</span>, <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">of His body</span>) The body here does not mean the Church, which is contained in the subject, <span class="ital">we are</span>, but the body of Christ Himself.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>, <span class="ital">of</span>) <a href="/context/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man....">Genesis 2:23-24</a>, in the LXX.—<span class="greekheb">εἶπενʼ Αδὰμ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο νῦν ὀστοῦν ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ σὰρξ ἐκ τῆς σαρκός μου</span>. <span class="greekheb">Αὕτη κληθήσεται γυνὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἐλήφθη</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἕνεκεν τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ προσκολληθήσεται τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">of His flesh</span>) Moses mentions <span class="ital">bones</span> first, Paul <span class="ital">flesh;</span> because it is the bones chiefly that support the natural structure, of which the former (Moses) is speaking; but in the new creation [of which Paul is speaking], the flesh of Christ is more considered. Moreover, Moses speaks more fully; Paul omits what does not so much belong to the subject in hand. It is not our bones and our flesh, but <span class="ital">we</span>, that are spiritually propagated from the humanity of Christ, which has flesh and bones.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are members of his body [being], of his flesh, and of his bones</span> (the last seven words omitted in many manuscripts and in the R.V.). The reference is to the original formation of woman as narrated in <a href="/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>. Her very name indicated that she was "taken from man." She was taken from him and given to him. So the Church is taken from Christ and given to him. Taken from his body, sprung from his incarnation and his crucifixion and resurrection, the spiritual offspring of his humanity, and then given to him, to be his servant, nay, above a servant, his companion, friend, and confidant for evermore. If it had not been for the body of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>) the Church could have had no existence. No bride fit for the King of heaven could have sprung from the earth. As Eve came from the opened side of Adam, so figuratively the Church springs from the pierced side of Jesus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Omit of His flesh and of His bones. </body></html>
