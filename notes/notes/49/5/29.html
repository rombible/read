In all that corresponds to both, the husband is to show love to the wife, not only as a self, but as a weaker self, for whom he is bound to think and to act. It may be noted in passing that the very comparison accords with the Christian idea of the body as a part of the true self, redeemed to be a temple of God; and is utterly incongruous with the Gnostic conceptions (already beginning at Colossæ, probably not unknown in other Asiatic churches) of all matter as the source of evil, and of the body as that for which the spirit should not deign to care.<p>(29, 30) <span class= "bld">Even as the Lord the church: for we . . .</span>—Again St. Paul escapes from the type to rest on the Antitype (see <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>). The idea of the natural rearing and cherishing the body suggests the thought of the tender care of Christ, in which He “rears up” His Church from weak infancy to full maturity in heaven, and all the while “cherishes it (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>, spoken of His servants) as a nurse cherisheth her children,” “carrying it in His bosom” (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>), comforting and cheering its childlike weakness. Hence he goes back again to speak with great and special emphasis of our unity with Him.<p><span class= "bld">Of his flesh, and of his bones.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">made out of His flesh and bones</span>—parts, that is, of His glorified body, having “flesh and bones” (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>). The expression is unique, suggested, of course, by <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>, “This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,” but designed to bring out in a startling emphasis the true meaning of the familiar phrase, “the members of His body.” We are grafted into Him. What we grow to be is, so to speak, the product of His divine substance, proceeding from the indwelling life which gradually forms the organised limbs.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh - This is urged as an argument why a man should love his wife and show kindness to her. As no man disregards the happiness of his own body, or himself, so he should show equal care to promote the happiness of his wife. A sentiment similar to this is found in the classic writers. Thus, Curtius (lib. vii.) says, "Corporibus nostris quoe utique non odimus" - "We do not hate those things that pertain to our own bodies." So Seneca (Epis. 14), "Fateor insitam nobis esse corporis nostri charitatem" - "I confess that there is implanted in us the love of our own body." The word nourisheth here means properly to bring up, as e. g., children. The sense here is, that he provides for it, and guards it from exposure and want. The word "cherisheth" - &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  thalpei - means properly to "warm;" and may mean here that he defends it from cold by clothing - and the two expressions denote that he provides food and raiment for the body. So he is to do for his wife; and in like manner the Lord Jesus regards the church, and ministers to its spiritual necessities. But this should not be spiritualized too far. The "general" idea is all that we want - that Christ has a tender concern for the needs of the church, as a man has for his own body, and that the husband should show a similar regard for his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

The <span class="ital">thought</span> is the oneness of husband and wife, the position of the wife as part of the husband’s self; and the connection is this—“he should love her even as Christ loved the Church, for the wife, I say, is as the body in that natural relationship in which the husband is the head, so that in loving her he loves <span class="ital">himself</span>; and this is the reason in <span class="ital">nature</span> why he should love her, for according to this to hate his wife is to hate his own flesh, which is contrary to nature and a thing never seen”. <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> has here its non-ethical sense, practically = <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> (as in <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm" title="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?">Matthew 19:5</a>; <a href="/mark/10-8.htm" title="And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.">Mark 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>, etc.).—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐκτρέφει καὶ θάλπει αὐτήν</span>: <span class="ital">but nourisheth and cherisheth it</span>.

Its Latin version, f, presents the Vulgate text with some modifications.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">no</span> man <span class="ital">ever</span>] under normal conditions. True, in a distorted mental state a man may “hate his own flesh.” And in obedience to the will of God a man may so act as to be <span class="ital">said</span> to hate it; to choose that it should suffer rather than that God’s will should not be done (see, for such a use of “hate”, <a href="/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>). But under normal conditions it is not only man’s instinct but his duty to protect and nourish that mysterious work of God, his body, connected by God’s will in a thousand ways with the action of his spirit. “Self-love,” whether in the direction of flesh or of spirit, acts sinfully only when it acts outside God as the supreme and all-embracing Reason and Good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord</span>] Read, with full documentary evidence, <span class="bld">Christ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm" title="For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:">Ephesians 5:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδεὶς</span>) <span class="ital">no man</span>, unless indeed he revolts from nature and from himself.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἑαυτοῦ σάρκα</span>, <span class="ital">his own flesh</span>) <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>, at the end.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκτρέφει</span>) <span class="ital">very much nourishes it</span>, within.—<span class="greekheb">θάλπει</span>) <span class="ital">cherishes it</span>, without.

In this aspect of the case, too, the sharp eye of the apostle finds an analogy between the relation of the wife to the husband and that of the Church to Christ, expanded in the next verso. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Flesh<p>Instead of body, with reference to <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>.<p>Cherisheth (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here and <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>.
