the question is whether it is against flesh and blood, or against a more unearthly power of evil.<p><span class= "bld">Flesh and blood.</span>—Or rather (as perhaps also in <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>), <span class= "ital">blood and flesh.</span> So in <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>, “Not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh.” In <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>, we have “flesh and blood.” The sense is clearly, as the comparison of all these passages shows, “mere human power.” Possibly the word “blood” is here put first to prevent even a moment’s confusion with the idea of wrestling against “the flesh” as an evil power within ourselves. In many passages of this Epistle St. Paul had dwelt on the opposition of the Christian to the heathen life, and the duty of rebuking and putting to shame the works of darkness; but here he warns us that the struggle is not a struggle with the “flesh and blood” of wicked men—a struggle which may still admit of some reserve of sympathy—but a truceless war with the spiritual powers of evil themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Against principalities, against powers.</span>—See Note on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Against the rulers . . .</span>—“Principalities” and “powers” describe simply angelic powers, whether of good or evil. But in the following clauses St. Paul defines them as powers of evil, and appears to indicate two different aspects of this evil power. The original phrase is striking and powerful, “against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual powers of wickedness in the heavenly places.”<p><span class= "bld">The rulers of the darkness.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">the world-rulers of this darkness.</span> This phrase is simply a poetical expression of the idea conveyed by the title “the prince of this world,” applied to Satan in <a href="/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>; <a href="/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a> (on which see Notes). For “this darkness” is obviously (as our version renders it, following an early gloss on the passage) “the darkness of this present world,” as a world overshadowed by sin, and so kept, wholly or partially, from the light of God. The title “the prince of this world,” was applied by the Jews to Satan, especially in reference to his power over the heathen, as lying outside the safety of the covenant. St. Paul applies it in a corresponding sense here to those outside the wider covenant of the gospel; just as in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>, he speaks of excommunication from the Church as a “delivery to Satan.” The spirits of evil are therefore spoken of as wielding the power which the Tempter claims for himself (in <a href="/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>) over such souls as are still in darkness and alienation from God. This is a power real, but limited and transitory, able only to enslave those who “yield themselves” to it, and destined to be overcome; and it seems to refer especially to the concrete power of evil, exercised through physical and human agency.<p><span class= "bld">Spiritual wickedness in high places.</span>—The “spiritual powers” are not spiritual principles, but “spiritual hosts” of wickedness; and the phrase “in the heavenly places,” corresponding to “the power of the air” in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a> (where see Note), stands obviously in antithesis to “the darkness of this world.” The sense, as in all other cases, seems to be local. (See Note on <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>.) The spiritual hosts of evil are described as fighting in the region above the earth. But the meaning underlying this figure surely points to the power of evil as directly spiritual, not acting through physical and human agency, but attacking the spirit in that higher aspect, in which it contemplates heavenly things and ascends to the communion with God. As the former idea corresponds to the gross work of temptation on the high mountain, so this to the subtler spiritual temptation on the pinnacle of the temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we wrestle not </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ουκ εστιν ημιν η παλη</span>, <span class="ital">our struggle is not; against flesh and blood </span>— Not merely against human adversaries, however powerful, subtle, and cruel, nor against fleshly appetites; <span class="ital">but against principalities, against powers — </span>The mighty princes of all the infernal legions: and great is their power, and that likewise of the legions which they command. <span class="ital">Against the rulers of the darkness of this world </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">προς τους κοσμοκρατορας του σκοτους</span>, <span class="greekheb">του αιωνος τουτου</span>, <span class="ital">against the rulers of the world, of the darkness of this age. </span>Dr. Whitby explains this of “those evil spirits that ruled in the heathen nations which were yet in darkness,” and of “those that had their stations in the region of the air.” “Perhaps,” says Mr. Wesley, “these principalities and powers” (spoken of in the former clause) “remain mostly in the citadel of the kingdom of darkness; but there are other evil spirits who range abroad, to whom the provinces of the world are committed.” By <span class="ital">the darkness of this age, </span>that spiritual darkness is intended, which prevails during the present state of things. “Evil spirits,” Macknight thinks, “are called <span class="ital">rulers of this world, </span>because the dominion which, by the permission of God, they exercise, is limited to the darkness of this world; that is, this world darkened by ignorance, wickedness, and misery, and which is the habitation or prison assigned them, until the judgment of the great day, Jude, <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a>.” <span class="ital">Against spiritual wickedness </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">wicked spirits, </span>as the Syriac translates the expression. The word <span class="greekheb">πονηρια</span>, rendered <span class="ital">wickedness, </span>properly signifies malice joined with cunning, and is fitly mentioned as the characteristic of those wicked spirits with whom we are at war; and it is a quality so much the more dangerous, in that it exists in beings whose natural faculties are very great. And it must be observed, that they continually oppose faith, love, holiness, either by force or fraud, and labour to infuse unbelief, pride, idolatry, malice, envy, anger, hatred. <span class="ital">In high places </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εν τοις επουρανιοις</span>, <span class="ital">in, </span>or <span class="ital">about, heavenly places. </span>Those who translate it in the former way, think the expression refers to those places where they rebelled against the God of heaven, and drew in multitudes who were before holy and happy spirits, to take part with them in their impious revolt. But it seems more probable the sense is, <span class="ital">about heavenly places; </span>namely, the places which were once the abodes of those spirits, and which they still aspire to, as far as they are permitted; labouring at the same time to prevent our obtaining them. Dr. Goodwin, however, thinks that not <span class="ital">heavenly places, </span>but heavenly things are intended; namely, spiritual and eternal blessings, about which we may be properly said to wrestle with them, while we endeavour to secure these blessings to ourselves, and they to hinder us from attaining them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare and suffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we wrestle - Greek, "The wrestling to us;" or, "There is not to us a wrestling with flesh and blood." There is undoubtedly here an allusion to the ancient games of Greece, a part of the exercises in which consisted in wrestling; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25-27</a>. The Greek word used here - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;  pale&#772; - denotes a "wrestling;" and then a struggle, fight, combat. Here it refers to the struggle or combat which the Christian has to mainrain - the Christian warfare.<p>Not against flesh and blood - Not with people; see the notes on <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>. The apostle does not mean to say that Christians had no enemies among men that opposed them, for they were exposed often to fiery persecution; nor that they had nothing to contend with in the carnal and corrupt propensities of their nature, which was true of them then as it is now; but that their main controversy was with the invisible spirits of wickedness that sought to destroy them. They were the source and origin of all their spiritual conflicts, and with them the warfare was to be maintained.<p>But against principalities - There can be no doubt whatever that the apostle alludes here to evil spirits. Like good angels, they were regarded as divided into ranks and orders, and were supposed to be under the control of one mighty leader; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>. It is probable that the allusion here is to the ranks and orders which they sustained before their fall, something like which they may still retain. The word "principalities" refers to principal rulers, or chieftains.<p>Powers - Those who had power, or to whom the name of "powers" was given. Milton represents Satan as addressing the fallen angels in similar language:<p>"Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers."<p>Against the rulers of the darkness of this world - The rulers that preside over the regions of ignorance and sin with which the earth abounds, compare notes on <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>. "Darkness" is an emblem of ignorance, misery, and sin; and no description could be more accurate than that of representing these malignant spirits as ruling over a dark world. The earth - dark, and wretched and ignorant, and sinful - is just such a dominion as they would choose, or as they would cause; and the degradation and woe of the pagan world are just such as foul and malignant spirits would delight in. It is a wide and a powerful empire. It has been consolidated by ages. It is sustained by all the authority of law; by all the omnipotence of the perverted religious principle; by all the reverence for antiquity; by all the power of selfish, corrupt, and base passions. No empire has been so extended, or has continued so long, as that empire of darkness; and nothing on earth is so difficult to destroy.<p>Yet the apostle says that it was on that kingdom they were to make war. Against that, the kingdom of the Redeemer was to be set up; and that was to be overcome by the spiritual weapons which he specifies. When he speaks of the Christian warfare here, he refers to the contest with the powers of this dark kingdom. He regards each and every Christian as a soldier to wage war on it in whatever way he could, and wherever he could attack it. The contest therefore was not primarily with people, or with the internal corrupt propensities of the soul; it was with this vast and dark kingdom that had been set up over mankind. I do not regard this passage, therefore, as having a primary reference to the struggle which a Christian maintains with his own corrupt propensities. It is a warfare on a large scale with the entire kingdom of darkness over the world. Yet in maintaining the warfare, the struggle will be with such portions of that kingdom as we come in contact with and will actually relate:<p>(1) to our own sinful propensities - which are a part of the kingdom of darkness;<p>(2) with the evil passions of others - their pride, ambition, and spirit of revenge - which are also a part of that kingdom;<p>(3) with the evil customs, laws, opinions, employments, pleasures of the world - which are also a part of that dark kingdom;<p>(4) with error, superstition, false doctrine - which are also a part of that kingdom; and,<p>(5) with the wickedness of the pagan world - the sins of benighted nations - also a part of that kingdom. Wherever we come in contact with evil - whether in our own hearts or elsewhere - there we are to make war.<p>Against spiritual wickedness - Margin, "or wicked spirits." Literally, "The spiritual things of wickedness;" but the allusion is undoubtedly to evil spirits, and to their influences on earth.<p>In high places - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; - "in celestial or heavenly places." The same phrase occurs in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>, where it is translated, "in heavenly places." The word (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  epouranios) is used of those that dwell in heaven, <a href="/matthew/18-35.htm">Matthew 18:35</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; of those who come from heaven, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-48.htm">1 Corinthians 15:48</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; of the heavenly bodies, the sun, moon, and stars, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-40.htm">1 Corinthians 15:40</a>. Then the neuter plural of the word is used to denote the heavens; and then the "lower" heavens, the sky, the air, represented as the seat of evil spirits; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>. This is the allusion here. The evil spirits are supposed to occupy the lofty regions of the air, and thence to exert a baleful influence on the affairs of man. What was the origin of this opinion it is not needful here to inquire. No one can "prove," however, that it is incorrect. It is against such spirits, and all their malignant influences, that Christians are called to contend. In whatever way their power is put forth - whether in the prevalence of vice and error; of superstition and magic arts; of infidelity, atheism, or antinomianism; of evil customs and laws; of pernicious fashions and opinions, or in the corruptions of our own hearts, we are to make war on all these forms of evil, and never to yield in the conflict. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Greek, "For our wrestling ('the wrestling' in which we are engaged) is not against flesh," &c. Flesh and blood foes are Satan's mere tools, the real foe lurking behind them is Satan himself, with whom our conflict is. "Wrestling" implies that it is a hand-to-hand and foot-to-foot struggle for the mastery: to wrestle successfully with Satan, we must wrestle with God in irresistible prayer like Jacob (Ge 32:24-29; Ho 12:4). Translate, "The principalities &#8230; the powers" (Eph 1:21; Col 1:16; see on [2375]Eph 3:10). The same grades of powers are specified in the case of the demons here, as in that of angels there (compare Ro 8:38; 1Co 15:24; Col 2:15). The Ephesians had practiced sorcery (Ac 19:19), so that he appropriately treats of evil spirits in addressing them. The more clearly any book of Scripture, as this, treats of the economy of the kingdom of light, the more clearly does it set forth the kingdom of darkness. Hence, nowhere does the satanic kingdom come more clearly into view than in the Gospels which treat of Christ, the true Light.<p>rulers of the darkness of this world&#8212;Greek, "age" or "course of the world." But the oldest manuscripts omit "of world." Translate, "Against the world rulers of this (present) darkness" (Eph 2:2; 5:8; Lu 22:53; Col 1:13). On Satan and his demons being "world rulers," compare Joh 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; Lu 4:6; 2Co 4:4; 1Jo 5:19, Greek, "lieth in the wicked one." Though they be "world rulers," they are not the ruler of the universe; and their usurped rule of the world is soon to cease, when He shall "come whose right it is" (Eze 21:27). Two cases prove Satan not to be a mere subjective fancy: (1) Christ's temptation; (2) the entrance of demons into the swine (for these are incapable of such fancies). Satan tries to parody, or imitate in a perverted way, God's working (2Co 11:13, 14). So when God became incarnate, Satan, by his demons, took forcible possession of human bodies. Thus the demoniacally possessed were not peculiarly wicked, but miserable, and so fit subjects for Jesus' pity. Paul makes no mention of demoniacal possession, so that in the time he wrote, it seems to have ceased; it probably was restricted to the period of the Lord's incarnation, and of the foundation of His Church.<p>spiritual wickedness&#8212;rather as Greek, "The spiritual hosts of wickedness." As three of the clauses describe the power, so this fourth, the wickedness of our spiritual foes (Mt 12:45).<p>in high places&#8212;Greek, "heavenly places": in Eph 2:2, "the air," see on [2376]Eph 2:2. The alteration of expression to "in heavenly places," is in order to mark the higher range of their powers than ours, they having been, up to the ascension (Re 12:5, 9, 10), dwellers "in the heavenly places" (Job 1:7), and being now in the regions of the air which are called the heavens. Moreover, pride and presumption are the sins in heavenly places to which they tempt especially, being those by which they themselves fell from heavenly places (Isa 14:12-15). But believers have naught to fear, being "blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places" (Eph 1:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We wrestle not; </span> not only, or not principally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against flesh and blood; </span> men, consisting of flesh and blood, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a> <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But against principalities, against powers; </span> devils, <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a></span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the rulers of the darkness of this world; </span> either that rule in the dark air, where God permits them to be for the punishment of men; see <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a></span>: or rather, that rule in the dark places of the earth, the dark minds of men, and have their rule over them by reason of the darkness that is in them; in which respect the devil is called <span class="ital">the god of this world, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a></span>, and <span class="ital">the prince</span> of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a></span>.

The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, and some copies, read "you", instead of "we". This is a reason why saints should be strong in the Lord, and why they should put on the whole armour of God, and prepare for battle, since their enemies are such as here described: not "flesh and blood"; frail mortal men, such as were wrestled against in the Olympic games, to which the apostle alludes. For this wrestling, as Philo the Jew says (e), concerning Jacob's wrestling, is not of the body, but of the soul; see <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; and the meaning is, not with men only, for otherwise the saints have a conflict with men; with profane men, and wrestle against them, by bearing a testimony against their enormities, and by patiently enduring their reproaches, and conquer them by a constant adherence to Christ, and an exercise of faith upon him, which gets the victory over the world; and with heretical men, and maintain a conflict with them, by watching and observing the first appearance of their errors and heresies, and declaring against them, and by using Scripture arguments to confute them, and by rejecting the stubborn and incorrigible from church communion: yet they wrestle not against these only, <p>but against principalities, against powers; by whom are meant not civil magistrates, or the Roman governors, though these are sometimes so called, <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>, and may be said to be the rulers of the darkness of this world, or of the dark Heathen world, and were in high places, and were of wicked and malicious spirits, against the people of Christ; yet these cannot be opposed to flesh and blood, or to men, since they were such themselves; and though they were in high, yet not in heavenly places; and the connection with the preceding verse shows the contrary, the enemy being the devil, and the armour spiritual; wherefore the devils are here designed, who are described from their power, rule, and government; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, both in this clause, and in the next: <p>and against the rulers of the darkness of this world; that is, over wicked men in it, who are in a state of darkness itself; and so Satan is called the prince, and god of the world, <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>. The Jews use this very word, the apostle does here, of the angel of death; who is called darkness (f); and the devil is called by them,  , "the prince of darkness" (g); and mention is made by them of , "the darkness of the world" (h); from whom the apostle seems to have taken these phrases, as being in common use among the Jews; who also use it of civil governors (i), and render it, as here, "the rulers of the world", and say it signifies monarchs, such as rule from one end of the world to the other (k): some copies, and the Ethiopic version, leave out the phrase, of this world. It follows, <p>against spiritual wickedness in high places; or wicked spirits, as the devils are, unclean, proud, lying, deceitful, and malicious; who may be said to be in "high" or "heavenly places"; not in places super celestial, or in the highest heavens, in the third heaven, where God, angels, and saints are; but in the aerial heavens, where the power or posse of devils reside, and where they are above us, over our heads, overlooking us, and watching every advantage against us; and therefore we should have on our armour, and be in a readiness to engage them; and so the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, "under", or "beneath heaven"; and the Arabic version, "in the air". <p>(e) Leg.

Nothing else, namely, than <span class="ital">lucta</span>, a <span class="ital">wrestling</span>, is the meaning of the <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> (Hom. <span class="ital">Il.</span> xxiii. 635, 700 ff.; Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> iv. 8. 27; Plat. <span class="ital">Legg.</span> vii. 795 D; and Ast, <span class="ital">ad Legg.</span> p. 378), a word occurring only here in the N.T., and evidently one specially <span class="ital">chosen</span> by the apostle (who elsewhere employs <span class="greekheb">ἀγών</span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΆΧΗ</span></span></span>), with the view of bringing out the more strongly in connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΑἿΜΑ ΚΑῚ ΣΆΡΚ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> the contrast between this less perilous form of contest and that which follows.

T. 392]) we have to derive from a preceding special notion an analogous more general one. What we have to sustain, Paul would say, is not the (less perilous) wrestling contest with blood and flesh, but we have to contend with the powers and authorities, etc. We have accordingly neither to say that with <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> Paul only lighted in passing on another metaphor (my own former view), nor to suppose (the <span class="ital">usual</span> opinion) that he employed <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> in the general sense of <span class="ital">certamen</span>, which, however, is only done in isolated poetic passages (Lycophr. 124, 1358), and hence we have the less reason to overlook the designed <span class="ital">choice</span> of the expression in our passage, or to depart from its proper signification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς αἷμα καὶ σάρκα</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="ital">against feeble men</span>, just as <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>.

The <span class="greekheb">σκότος τοῦτο</span> is the <span class="ital">existing, present</span> darkness, which, namely, is characteristic of the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span>, and from which only believers are delivered, inasmuch as they have become <span class="greekheb">φῶς ἐν κυρίῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τέκνα τοῦ φωτός</span> (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men....">Ephesians 4:8-9</a>), being translated out of the domain opposed to divine truth into the possession of the same, and thus becoming themselves <span class="greekheb">ὡς φωστῆρες ἐν κόσμῳ</span> (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Php 2:15</a>). The reading <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σκότους τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου</span> is a correct gloss. This pre-Messianic darkness is the <span class="ital">element</span> adverse to God, in which the <span class="ital">sway</span> of the world-ruling demons has its <span class="ital">essence and operation</span>, and without which their dominion would not take place. The devils are called <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτορες</span> (comp. <span class="ital">Orph.

The Rabbins, too, adopted the word <span class="greekheb">קזמוקרטור</span>, and employed it sometimes of kings, while they also say of the angel of death that God has made him <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτωρ</span>. See Schoettgen, <span class="ital">Horae</span>, p. 790; Buxtorf, <span class="ital">Lex. Talmud</span>, p. 2006 f.; Wetstein, p. 259. Later also the Gnostics called the devil by this name (Iren. i. 1), and in the <span class="ital">Testamentum Salomonis</span> (Fabricius, <span class="ital">Pseudepigr</span>. i. p. 1047) the demons say to Solomon: <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν τὰ λεγόμενα στοιχεῖα</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ κοσμοκράτορες τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>. The opinion that the compound has been weakened into the general signification <span class="ital">rulers</span> (Harless) is not susceptible of proof, and not to be supported by such Rabbinical passages as <span class="ital">Bresh. rabba</span>, sect. 58 f., 57. Ephesians 1 : “Abrahamus persecutus quatuor <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτορας</span>,” where <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτ</span>. denotes the <span class="ital">category</span> of the kings, and this <span class="ital">chosen</span> designation has the aim of <span class="ital">glorifying</span>. See also, in opposition to this alleged weakening, <span class="ital">Shir.

The adjective neuter, singular or plural, is collective, comprehending the beings in question according to their qualitative category as a corporate body, like <span class="greekheb">τὸ πολιτικόν</span>, the burgess-body (Herod. vii. 103); <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱππικόν</span>, the cavalry (<a href="/revelation/9-16.htm" title="And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.">Revelation 9:16</a>); <span class="greekheb">τὰ ληστρικά</span>, the robbers (Polyaen. v. 14, 141), <span class="greekheb">τὰ δοῦλα</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ αἰχμάλωτα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Moral wickedness is their essential quality; hence the devil is pre-eminently <span class="greekheb">ὁ πονηρός</span>. The explanation <span class="ital">spirituales nequitias</span> (Erasmus, Beza, Castalio, Clarius, Zeger, Cornelius a Lapide, Wolf, and others) is impossible, since, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΠΝΕΥΜΑΤΙΚΆ</span></span></span> expressed the quality substantively and raised it to the position of subject (see Matthiae, p. 994; Kühner, II. p. 122), we should have to analyse it as: <span class="ital">the spiritual nature</span>, or <span class="ital">the spiritual part, the spiritual side</span> of wickedness, all of which are unsuitable to the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΤΟῖς ἘΠΟΥΡΑΝΊΟΙς</span></span></span>] Chrysostom, Theodoret, Photius, Oecumenius, Cajetanus, Castalio, Camerarius, Heinsius, Clarius, Calovius, Glass, Witsius, Wolf, Morus, Flatt, and others incorrectly render: <span class="ital">for the heavenly possessions</span>, so that it would indicate the object of the conflict, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would stand for <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> or <span class="greekheb">διά</span>. Against this view we may urge not the order of the words, since in fact this element pushed on <span class="ital">to the end</span> would be brought out with emphasis (Kühner, II. p. 625), but certainly the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span>, which does not mean <span class="ital">on account of</span>,[303] and <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span>, which in our Epistle is always meant in a <span class="ital">local</span> sense (see on <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>). The view of Matthies is also incorrect, that it denotes the <span class="ital">place where</span> of the conflict: “in the kingdom of heaven, in which the Christians, as received into that kingdom, are also constantly contending against the enemies of God.” <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span> does not signify the kingdom of heaven in the sense of Matthies, but <span class="ital">the heavenly regions</span>, heaven. Rückert, too, is incorrect, who likewise understands the <span class="ital">place where</span> of the conflict, holding that the contest is to be sustained, as not with flesh and blood, so also <span class="ital">not upon the same solid ground</span>, but <span class="ital">away in the air</span>, and is thus most strictly <span class="ital">mars iniquus</span>. Apart from the oddness of this thought, according to it the contrast would in fact be one not of terrestrial and superterrestrial locality, but <span class="ital">of solid ground</span> and <span class="ital">baseless air</span>, so that Paul in employing <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουραν</span>. would have selected a quite inappropriate designation, and must have said <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἀέρι</span>. Baumgarten-Crusius gives us the choice between two incorrect interpretations: the <span class="ital">kingdom of spirits</span>, to which the kingdom of Christ too belongs, or the <span class="ital">affairs of that kingdom</span>. The <span class="ital">correct</span> connection is with <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας</span>, so that it expresses the <span class="ital">seat</span> of the evil spirits. So Jerome, Ambrosiaster, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Vatablus, Estius, Grotius, Erasmus Schmid, Bengel, Koppe, and many, including Usteri, Meier, Holzhausen, Harless, Olshausen, de Wette, Bleek. This “<span class="ital">in the heavenly regions</span>” is not, however, in accordance with the context, to be understood of the abode of God, of Christ, and of the angels (<a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>);[304] but, according to the popular view (comp. <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26</a>)—in virtue of the flexible character of the conception “heaven,” which embraces very different degrees of height (compare the conception of the seven heavens, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>)—of the <span class="ital">superterrestrial regions</span>, which, although still pertaining to the domain of the earth’s atmosphere, yet relatively <span class="ital">appear</span> as heaven, so that in <span class="ital">substance</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span> here denotes the same as <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀήρ</span>, by which at <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a> the domain of the Satanic kingdom is accurately and properly designated.[305] This passage serves as a guide to the import of ours, which is wrongly denied by Hahn (<span class="ital">Theol. d. N.T.</span> I. p. 336 f.) on the basis of an erroneous interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. According to the Rabbins, too, the lower of the seven heavens still fall within the region of the atmosphere. See Wetstein, <span class="ital">ad</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>. And the <span class="ital">reason</span> why Paul does not here say <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἀέρι</span> is, that he wishes to bring out <span class="ital">as strongly as possible</span> the superhuman and superterrestrial nature of the hostile spirits, for which purpose to name <span class="ital">the air</span> as the place of their dwelling might be less appropriate than to speak of <span class="ital">the heavenly regions</span>, an expression which entirely accords with the lively <span class="ital">colouring</span> of his picture.[306] Semler and Storr, ignoring this significant bearing and suitableness of the expression, have arbitrarily imported a <span class="ital">formerly</span>, as though the <span class="ital">previous</span> abode of the demons had any connection with the matter! Schenkel has even imported the <span class="ital">irony of a paradox</span>, which has the design of making the assumption of divine power and glory on the part of the demons ridiculous, as though anything of the sort were at all in keeping with the whole profound seriousness of our passage, or could have been recognised by any reader whatever! Hofmann finally (<span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, I. p. 455) has, after a rationalizing fashion, transformed the simple direct statement of place into the thought: “not limited to this or that locality of the earthly world, but overruling the same, as the heavens encircle the earth.” The thought of this turn so easily made Paul would have known how to <span class="ital">express</span>—even though he had but said: <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὄντα ὡς ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>, or more clearly: <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὄντα πανταχοῦ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν</span>. The absence of a connective article is not at all opposed to our interpretation, since <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span> might the more be combined into <span class="ital">one idea</span>, as it was the counterpart of such spirits upon earth.

Reason for speaking of the <span class="greekheb">μεθοδεῖαι τοῦ διαβόλου</span> as dangers against which the Christian must stand his ground. The <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is explanatory, = “the wiles of the Devil, I say, for it is not mere <span class="ital">men</span> we have to face”. The term <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span>, which occurs only this once in the NT, is used in classical Greek occasionally in the general sense of a <span class="ital">battle</span> or combat (in the poets, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Aesch., <span class="ital">Cho.</span>, 866; Eurip., <span class="ital">Heracl.</span>, 159), but usually in the specific sense of a contest in the form of <span class="ital">wrestling</span>. If it has its proper sense here, as is most probable, there is a departure for the time being from the figure of the panoply, and a transition to one which brings up different ideas. Has Paul, then, who elsewhere uses the more general figures of the <span class="greekheb">μάχη</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἁγών</span>, etc., any special object in view in selecting <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> here? There is nothing to indicate any such special object, unless it be to bring out the <span class="ital">hand to hand</span> nature of the conflict, “the <span class="ital">personal, individualising</span> nature of the encounter” (Ell.). The <span class="greekheb">ἡ</span> defines the <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> in view, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the physical struggle, as not the <span class="ital">kind</span> of <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span> with which we are concerned—which is “for us” (<span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>). The <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span> of the TR has the support of [803] [804] [805]3[806] [807] [808], most cursives, and most Versions; <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> is read by [809] [810]*[811], Eth., Goth., etc. The case is somewhat evenly balanced. TrWH place <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> in the margin; Lach., Tisch., etc., keep <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>. The form <span class="greekheb">αἷμα καὶ σάρξ</span> occurs only here and (acc. to the best critics) in <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>. Elsewhere it is <span class="greekheb">σὰρξ καὶ αἷμα</span>; but the sense is the same, = <span class="ital">feeble humanity</span>. The phrase occurs four times in the NT, always with the same general sense of man in the character of his <span class="ital">weakness</span> and <span class="ital">dependence</span>, but with slightly varying references; <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, with regard to our <span class="ital">corporeal</span> being in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>; our <span class="ital">intellectual</span> power in <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>; our <span class="ital">spiritual</span> capacity as contrasted with invisible, diabolic agents (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Ell. on <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>). The idea of <span class="ital">carnal desires</span> or <span class="ital">passions</span> which is ascribed to the phrase here by some (Jer., Matthies, etc.) would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> without <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὰς ἀρχάς</span>: <span class="ital">but against the principalities</span>. The formula <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> indicates not a <span class="ital">comparative</span> negation, as if = “not so much against flesh and blood as against the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>,” but an absolute. Meyer regards the clause as a case of brachylogy, some term of more <span class="ital">general</span> sense than <span class="greekheb">πάλη</span>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">μάχη</span> or <span class="greekheb">μαχετέον</span> having to be understood, = “for us there is not a <span class="ital">wrestling</span> with flesh and blood, but a <span class="ital">fight</span> with the principalities”. This on the ground that the idea of <span class="ital">wrestling</span> is inconsistent with that of the <span class="ital">panoply</span>. But while it is true that there is a change in the figure for the time being, there is nothing strange in that, neither is there any incongruity in representing the Christian’s <span class="ital">conflict</span> as a <span class="ital">wrestling</span>—an <span class="ital">individual</span> encounter and one <span class="ital">at close quarters</span>. On the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="ital">principalities</span> or <span class="ital">rulers</span> applied here to the powers of <span class="ital">evil</span>, see on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a> above.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὰς ἐξουσίας</span>: <span class="ital">against the authorities</span>. On <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, here designating <span class="ital">demonic</span> authorities, see on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a> above.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τοὺς κοσμοκράτορας τοῦ σκότους</span> [<span class="greekheb">τοῦ αἰῶνος</span>] <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span>: <span class="ital">against the world-rulers of the darkness of this world</span> (or, <span class="ital">of this darkness</span>). <span class="greekheb">τοῦ αἰῶνος</span> is inserted after <span class="greekheb">σκότους</span> by the TR, and is found in most cursives, and in such uncials as [812]3[813]3[814] [815] [816] [817]. It is omitted in [818] [819] [820] [821]*[822] [823], 17, 672, etc., and is rejected by LTTrWHRV. In the NT we have such designations as <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμους τούτου</span> (<a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>), <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), applied to Satan. The phrase <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτωρ τοῦ σκότους τούτου</span> occurs only here. The noun <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτωρ</span> is found in the Orphic Hymns (iii., 3, of Satan), in inscriptions (C. I., 5892, with ref. to the emperor), in Gnostic writings (of the devil), and in the Rabbinical literature in transliterated Hebrew form (of the angel of death, and of kings like the four pursued by Abraham, and Nebuchadnezzar, Evil-Merodach, Belshazzar; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; Fischer’s <span class="ital">Buxtorf, Lex.</span>, p. 996, etc.). According to usage as well as formation, therefore, it means not merely <span class="ital">rulers</span> (Eth., Goth.), but <span class="ital">world-rulers</span>, powers dominating the world as such and working everywhere. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σκότους</span> limits their dominion, however, to the world as it now is in the darkness of its ignorance and evil, and suggests the destined termination of their operation.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας</span>: <span class="ital">against the spirit-forces of wickedness</span>. The repetition of the <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> before each of the four powers named in the clause has rhetorical force. Such renderings as “spiritual wickedness” (Tynd., Bish., AV), “spiritual craftiness” (Cran.), <span class="ital">spirituales nequitiae</span> (Erasm., Beza, Wolf., etc.), are inadequate. The phrase <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικά</span> is not the same as <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνεύματα</span>, but means properly speaking the <span class="ital">spiritual things</span> (so Wicl., “the spiritual things of wickedness”). It is possible that the neut. adj. has the <span class="ital">collective</span> force here; in support of which Meyer and others adduce such phrases as <span class="greekheb">τὸ πολιτικόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱππικόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ λῃστρικά</span>, etc. But <span class="greekheb">τὸ πολιτικόν</span> seems to mean the whole of that section of the community which consists of <span class="greekheb">πολῖται</span>; <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱππικόν</span>, also <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἱππικά</span> (Polyb., iii., 114, 5) means <span class="ital">cavalry</span>; and <span class="greekheb">τὰ λῃστρικά</span> is used for pirate-vessels. The form <span class="greekheb">τὸ λῃστικόν</span>, however, has both the sense of <span class="ital">piracy</span> (Thucyd., i., 4, 13), and that of a <span class="ital">band of robbers</span> (Thucyd., ii., 69). This may perhaps justify the sense of <span class="ital">spirit-bands</span> or <span class="ital">spiritual hosts</span> here. But it seems most consonant with usage to give the term <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας</span> the simple sense of “the spiritual things,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “<span class="ital">elements</span> or <span class="ital">forces</span> of wickedness,” without connecting with it the doubtful connotation of <span class="ital">armies, hosts</span>, or <span class="ital">hordes</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Abb., <span class="ital">in loc.</span>). The <span class="greekheb">πονηρίας</span> is the gen. of <span class="ital">quality</span>, = the spirit-forces whose essential character is wickedness.—<span class="greekheb">ἑν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>: <span class="ital">in the heavenly regions</span>. On <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπουράνια</span> see under <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a> above. The phrase, of which this is the fifth occurrence in the Epistle, is most naturally understood in the <span class="ital">local</span> sense which it has in the previous instances. Some depart from this sense and make it = <span class="ital">the heavenly blessings</span>, giving at the same time the meaning of “for,” “in behalf” to <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, = “for the heavenly possessions”. So even Chrys., Theod., and Oec., followed by Witsius, Wolf., etc. But <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> cannot = <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> or <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, not even in <a href="/matthew/6-7.htm" title="But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.">Matthew 6:7</a>; <a href="/john/16-30.htm" title="Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.">John 16:30</a>; <a href="/acts/7-29.htm" title="Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.">Acts 7:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?">1 Corinthians 9:4</a>. Others, retaining the local sense, take the phrase as a designation of the scene of the <span class="ital">combat, e.g.</span> = “in the kingdom of heaven,” that being the region in which Christians contend with the enemies of God (Matthies), or “in the air” as contrasted with the <span class="ital">solid ground</span> (Rück.). But the term qualifies <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικά</span>. Forming one idea with that, it dispenses with the article; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ ἀέρος</span>, <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26</a>; <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πλουσίοις ἐν τῷ νῦν αἰῶνι</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, etc. It defines the domain of these spirit-forces. Their haunts are those superterrestrial regions, not the highest heavens which are the abode of God, Christ, and angels, but those lower heavens which are at once subcelestial and superterrestrial. The phrase and the idea may be suggested by the Jewish notion of a series of seven heavens, each distinguished from the other, the third or (later) the fourth, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, being identified with Paradise. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Morfill and Charles, <span class="ital">Book of the Secrets of Enoch</span>, p. xl. The phrase expresses, therefore, much the same idea as the phrase <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀέρος</span> in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. The reason why Paul uses <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span> and not <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἀέρι</span> here may be, as Meyer suggests, his wish to “bring out <span class="ital">as strongly as possible</span> the superhuman and superterrestrial nature of these hostile spirits”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[803] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[804] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

War and the games are associated in the language of <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-4.htm" title="No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier....">2 Timothy 2:4-5</a>. But here, as Ellicott observes, there need be no mingling of metaphors. War involves wrestling, in many a hand to hand encounter.—The Gr. word (<span class="ital">palê</span>, wrestling) is found only here in Gr. literature, but is cognate to <span class="ital">palæstra</span>, and other familiar words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle takes it for granted that the Christian life <span class="ital">is</span>, from one point of view, essentially a conflict. “We” obviously, by context, means all Christians as such. Cp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>, &c. But it is a conflict maintained, in Christ, with Divine power and from a dominating position.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">flesh and blood</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">blood and flesh</span>”; but English usage makes the other order better, as a rendering. The phrase occurs (in the opposite order of words) <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>. It denotes (as 1 Corinthians 15) humanity in its present mortal conditions, or (other reff.) humanity simply. “Man,” <span class="ital">as now constituted</span>, will not inherit the eternal kingdom; “man” did not illuminate St Peter; “man” did not teach the Gospel to St Paul; Christ so became “Man” as to be able to taste death. The thought here is not that we are not wrestling with our bodily desires, or weaknesses, but that we are not wrestling with <span class="ital">mere mortal men</span>. True, they may be our ostensible and immediate enemies or obstacles, but behind them is the central force of evil in the spirit-world. See the language of <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>, and Abp Trench’s note upon it (<span class="ital">Epistles to the Seven Churches</span>, p. 104). It will be observed how forcible is the testimony of the Apostle here to the objective existence of the world of evil spirits. He not merely takes it for granted, but carefully distinguishes it from the world of humanity. See further, Appendix G.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">principalities … powers</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">the principalities</span>, &c. See <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; and notes. Here, as <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; the ref. obviously is to personal <span class="ital">evil</span> spirits as members and leaders of an organized spirit-world. For allusions to such organization, under its head, cp. the visions of the Revelation, esp. <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>. And cp. <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. Note also the “<span class="ital">Legion</span>” of evil spirits (<a href="/mark/5-9.htm" title="And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.">Mark 5:9</a>; <a href="/mark/5-15.htm" title="And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.">Mark 5:15</a>; <a href="/luke/8-30.htm" title="And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.">Luke 8:30</a>), compared with the “more than twelve <span class="ital">Legions</span> of (holy) angels”, <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm" title="Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?">Matthew 26:53</a>. Great numbers and organized action are at once suggested by the military word; a word used on both occasions with profound earnestness and appeal to fact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">leaders</span> of the host of evil are alone mentioned here, and in the parallels, as are the leaders of the host of good in <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>, &c. The “plebeian angels militant” (<span class="ital">Par. Lost</span>, x. 442), are taken for granted, represented in their chiefs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the rulers of the darkness of this world</span>] Lit. as R. V., <span class="bld">the world-rulers of this darkness</span>. The words “of this world” (or rather “age”) are probably an explanatory insertion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">This darkness</span>” is the present order of things on earth, in its aspect as a scene of sin. As such it is <span class="ital">dark</span>, with the shadows of delusion, woe, and death. See <a href="/luke/22-53.htm" title="When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.">Luke 22:53</a> (a suggestive parallel) and other reff. under <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The world-rulers</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the context obviously points to personal evil spirits, exercising rule, in some real sense, over the world; and the question is, what does the world (<span class="ital">cosmos</span>) mean here? See in reply <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a> and note. “The world” here, as very often in St John, and often in St Paul (esp. in 1 Cor.), denotes not the Universe, nor the earth and sea, but humanity as fallen and rebel. As such, it is the realm of these powers of evil. Their Head is the usurping, but permitted, Cæsar of this empire, which is not so much local as moral; and his subordinate spirits are accordingly “imperial rulers” within it, for him.—The Gr. word (<span class="ital">cosmocratôr</span>) appears in Rabbinic literature, transliterated (see Ellicott here). It is used sometimes there as a mere magniloquent synonym for “king.” But we may be sure of a more special meaning in a passage like this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For allusions to the mysterious “authority” of the Evil Power over the human “world,” in its ethical aspect at least, cp. <a href="/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>; <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>; <a href="/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a>. It has been asked whether this authority is connected with a <span class="ital">previous lawful</span> presidency of the great Spirit now fallen, over this region of the Universe. But “God knoweth” is the best answer to such enquiries, till the veil is lifted. The fact of the present authority is our chief concern; and in this respect we are plainly warned that there is a real antagonism between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of the Evil One, and that in both cases we have the phenomenon of a spiritual dominion expressing itself through human organization and institution. See further on <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>, above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">spiritual wickedness in high</span> places] Lit., <span class="bld">the spiritual</span> things <span class="bld">of wickedness in the heavenly</span> places. R.V. paraphrases “the spiritual <span class="ital">hosts</span>, &c.”; and this well gives the meaning. The idea is of beings and forces, spiritual as distinguished from material, belonging to and working for “wickedness.” Wickedness is viewed as having its visible and invisible agents, and these are the invisible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">In the heavenly places</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the fifth occurrence of the phrase in this Epistle (cp. <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>). The adjective occurs also <a href="/matthew/18-35.htm" title="So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if you from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.">Matthew 18:35</a>; <a href="/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-40.htm" title="There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.">1 Corinthians 15:40</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-48.htm" title="As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly....">1 Corinthians 15:48-49</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2 Timothy 4:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>. The connexion of it with anything evil is confined to this passage, and is confessedly startling. Of the several expositions offered, the oldest, given by St Jerome here, seems best to meet the case; that which interprets “heaven” as the large antithesis to “earth” (cp. <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26</a>, “birds of <span class="ital">the heaven</span>”; &c.), and “heavenly,” accordingly, as “un-earthly,” super-terrestrial, belonging to the region of things unseen and (in power) superior to man, of which the impalpable sky is the parable. See above on <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>, “the authority <span class="ital">of the air</span>.” The import of the words, then, is that we have to deal, in the combat of the soul and of the Church, with spiritual agents of evil occupying a sphere of action invisible and practically boundless.—In St Ignatius’ <span class="ital">Ep. to the Ephesians</span>, c. xiii, the same Gr. adjective is used, with an almost certainly similar reference. See Bp Lightfoot there (<span class="ital">Ignatius</span>, vol. ii. p. 66), and our <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, p. 28.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>G. THE CONFLICT WITH PERSONAL EVIL SPIRITS. (Ch. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have remarked in the notes on the strong testimony given by this verse, with its exact wording, to the real and objective existence of such personal beings. We may add that such testimony still gains in strength when it is remembered that it was first addressed (at least among other destinations) to Ephesus, and that Ephesus (see Acts 19) was a peculiarly active scene of asserted magical and other dealings with the unseen darkness. Supposing that the right line to take in dealing with such beliefs and practices had been to say that the whole basis of them was a fiction of the human mind, not only would such a verse as this not have been written, but, we may well assume, something would have been written strongly contradictory to the thought of it. As it stands, the passage is in full accord with main lines of Scripture doctrine, in both Testaments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>H.

It is well that they are not holders of all things; yet the power not only of the devil himself, but also of those over whom he exercises authority, is great. There seem to be other kinds of evil spirits, that remain more at home in the citadel of the kingdom of darkness: principalities, powers. This third class is different, inasmuch as they go abroad and take possession, as it were, of the provinces of the world: rulers [holders] of the world.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ σκότους</span>, of the darkness) Herein they are distinguished from angels of light.

The contest is much more difficult in darkness.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου</span>, of this world) The word <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτορας</span>, the holders (rulers) of the world, directly governs the two genitives <span class="greekheb">σκότους</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνος</span>, of the darkness and of this world, according to [in relation to] either part of the compound word. <span class="greekheb">Κόσμος</span>, world, and <span class="greekheb">αἰῶν</span>, age, are to be referred mutually to each other, as time and place.[99] The term, <span class="ital">Holders</span> (rulers) <span class="ital">of the world</span>, is the ground on which this wickedness is practised. There are princes of the darkness of the world in the present age. The connection between <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">world</span>, and <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν</span>, <span class="ital">age</span>, is not grammatical but logical: <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">world</span> (mundus), in all its extent; <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν</span>, <span class="ital">world, age</span> (sæculum), the present world, in its disposition (character), course, and feeling. I cannot say <span class="greekheb">κόσμος τοῦ αἰῶνος</span>, as, on the contrary, I can say <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν τοῦ κόσμου</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ</span>, <span class="ital">the spiritual things</span>) The antithesis is <span class="ital">blood and flesh</span>. These <span class="ital">spiritual things</span> are opposed to the <span class="ital">spiritual things of grace</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>, and are contrary to faith, hope, love, the gifts [of the Spirit], either in the way of a force opposite [to those graces], or by a false imitation of them. Moreover, as in the same epistle, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>, <span class="ital">spirits</span> are used for <span class="ital">spiritual things</span>, so here <span class="ital">spiritual things</span> are very aptly used for <span class="ital">spirits</span>. For these <span class="ital">spirits</span> make their assault with such quickness and dexterity, that the soul does not almost think [generally is not aware] of the presence of these foreign existences lurking beneath, but believes that it is something in itself within which produces the spiritual temptation; and even <span class="greekheb">πνευματικόν</span>, <span class="ital">spiritual</span>, in the singular, may be taken as a kind of military force, in the same way as <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱππικὸν</span>, <span class="ital">horsemen</span>, is applied in <a href="/revelation/9-16.htm" title="And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.">Revelation 9:16</a>, and <span class="greekheb">τὸ στρατιωτικὸν</span> is else where used of <span class="ital">an army;</span> so that here <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ</span>, viz. <span class="greekheb">τάγματα</span>, may be used as in Zosimus, 1. 3: <span class="greekheb">τὰ πεζικὰ τάγματα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ξενικόν</span>, The bands of infantry, a <span class="ital">foreign</span> force. Aristot. 3, pol. 10, p. 210.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>, <span class="ital">in places above the heavens</span>) Even enemies, but as captives (ch. <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>, note), may be in a royal palace, and adorn it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[99] <span class="greekheb">Κόσμος</span> refers to place; <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν</span> to time: <span class="ital">The world-rulers of the age; the world-rulers of the darkness</span>. But Engl. V. makes <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνος</span> governed by <span class="greekheb">σκότους</span>, <span class="ital">of the darkness of this world</span>.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood.</span> Our conflict is not with <span class="accented">men</span>, here denoted by "flesh and blood," which is usually a symbol of weakness, therefore denoting that our opponents are not weak mortals, but powers of a far more formidable order. <span class="cmt_word">But against the principalities, against the powers.</span> The same words as in <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; therefore the definite article is prefixed, as denoting what we are already familiar with: for though all of these, evil as well as good, have been put under Christ the Head, they have not been put under the members, but the evil among them are warring against these members with all the greater ferocity that they cannot assail the Head. <span class="cmt_word">Against the world-rulers of this [state of] darkness</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>). "World-rulers" denotes the extent of the dominion of these invisible foes - the term is applied only to the rulers of the most widely extended tracts; there is no part of the globe to which their influence does not extend, and where their dark rule does not show itself (comp. <a href="/luke/4-6.htm">Luke 4:6</a>). "This darkness" expressively denotes the element and the results of their rule. Observe contrast with Christ's servants, who are children of light, equivalent to order, knowledge, purity, joy, peace, etc.; while the element of the devil and his servants is darkness, equivalent to confusion, ignorance, crime, terror, strife, and all misery. <span class="cmt_word">Against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.</span> The natural meaning, though questioned by some, is, either that these hosts of wickedness have their residence in heavenly places, or, that these places are the scene of our conflict with them. The latter seems more agreeable to the context, for "in heavenly places" does not denote a geographical locality here any more than in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> and Ephesians 2:6. When it is said that "we have been seated with Christ in heavenly places," the allusion is to the spiritual experience of his people; in spirit they are at the gate of heaven, where their hearts are full of heavenly thoughts and feelings; the statement now before us is that, even in such places, amid their most fervent experiences or their most sublime services, they are subject to the attacks of the spirits of wickedness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We wrestle (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;)<p>Rev., more literally and correctly, our wrestling is. &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; wrestling, only here.<p>Flesh and blood<p>The Greek reverses the order.<p>Principalities and powers<p>See on <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>.<p>Rulers of the darkness of this world (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Rev., more correctly, world-rulers of this darkness.
