A slave in the eye of the law had no rights, and therefore no responsibility or hope. St. Paul therefore bids him, as a Christian, lift his thoughts to a region in which all, bond and free alike, may hear the blessing, “Well done, good and faithful servant.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:5-9 The duty of servants is summed up in one word, obedience. The servants of old were generally slaves. The apostles were to teach servants and masters their duties, in doing which evils would be lessened, till slavery should be rooted out by the influence of Christianity. Servants are to reverence those over them. They are to be sincere; not pretending obedience when they mean to disobey, but serving faithfully. And they must serve their masters not only when their master's eye is upon them; but must be strict in the discharge of their duty, when he is absent and out of the way. Steady regard to the Lord Jesus Christ will make men faithful and sincere in every station, not grudgingly or by constraint, but from a principle of love to the masters and their concerns. This makes service easy to them, pleasing to their masters, and acceptable to the Lord Christ. God will reward even the meanest drudgery done from a sense of duty, and with a view to glorify him. Here is the duty of masters. Act after the same manner. Be just to servants, as you expect they should be to you; show the like good-will and concern for them, and be careful herein to approve yourselves to God. Be not tyrannical and overbearing. You have a Master to obey, and you and they are but fellow-servants in respect to Christ Jesus. If masters and servants would consider their duties to God, and the account they must shortly give to him, they would be more mindful of their duty to each other, and thus families would be more orderly and happy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing that whatsoever good thing - Whatever a man does that is right, for that he shall be appropriately rewarded. No matter what his rank in life, if he discharges his duty to God and man, he will be accepted. A man in a state of servitude may so live as to honor God; and, so living, he should not be greatly solicitous about his condition. A master may fail to render suitable recompense to a slave. But, if the servant is faithful to God, he will recompense him in the future world. It is in this way that religion would make the evils of life tolerable, by teaching those who are oppressed to hear their trials in a patient spirit, and to look forward to the future world of reward. Religion does not approve of slavery. It is the friend of human rights. If it had full influence on earth, it would restore every man to freedom, and impart to each one his rights. Christianity nowhere requires its friends to make or to own a slave. No one under the proper influence of religion ever yet made a man a slave; there is no one under its proper influence who would not desire that all should be free; and just in proportion as true religion spreads over the world, will universal freedom be its attendant. But Christianity would lighten the evils of slavery even while it exists, and would comfort those who are doomed to so hard a lot, by assuring them that there they may render acceptable service to God, and that they soon will be admitted to a world where galling servitude will be known no more. If they may not have freedom here, they may have contentment if they feel that wrong is done them by men, they may feel that right will be done them by God; if their masters do not reward them for their services here, God will; and if they may not enjoy liberty here, they will soon be received into the world of perfect freedom - heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. any man doeth&#8212;Greek, "any man shall have done," that is, shall be found at the Lord's coming to have done.<p>the same&#8212;in full payment, in heaven's currency.<p>shall &#8230; receive&#8212;(2Co 5:10; Col 3:25; but all of grace, Lu 17:10).<p>bond or free&#8212;(1Co 7:22; 12:13; Ga 3:28; Col 3:11).

Or, according to the text of T and WH = “knowing that each, if he shall have done any good thing”. Participal clause subjoining a reason or encouragement for a service rendered in sincerity, with hearty good-will, and as to the Lord Himself. The encouragement lies in their Christian knowledge of the Lord’s reward. <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες</span>, not = “who know” as if <span class="greekheb">οἱ εἰδότες</span>, but “seeing ye know,” “knowing as ye do”. The <span class="greekheb">ποιήσῃ</span>, as followed by the <span class="greekheb">κομίσεται</span>, is best rendered “shall have done”. The readings vary greatly. Passing over minor diversities, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰδόντες</span> for <span class="greekheb">εἰδόντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις ἕκαστος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἕκαστος ποιήσῃ</span> with omission of <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τι</span>, etc., we find exceptional uncertainty in the text of the <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span> clause. The TR reads <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ὅ ἐάν τι ἕκαστος</span>, which is given in L2 and most cursives. In that case <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> is the <span class="ital">potential</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> and the <span class="greekheb">τι</span> being separated by <span class="ital">tmesis</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἄν τινα καταβλάψῃ</span>, Plato, <span class="ital">Laws</span>, ix., 864 E), and the sense being = “whatsoever each,” etc. But in a considerable number of Manuscripts and Versions ([757] [758] [759] [760], 17, 37, Vulg., Arm., etc.) we find <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἕκαστος ὃ ἄν</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span>) <span class="greekheb">ποιήσῃ</span>,; in [761] [762], <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> (probably <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν ποιήσῃ</span>, while [763]3 inserts <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>; in [764]*, and one or two cursives (46, 62, 115, 129), <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐάν τι ἕκαστος</span>; and in B d, e, Petr. alex. Song of Solomon 6, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἔκαστος ἐάν τι ποιήσῃ</span>. This last reading is preferred by Tisch., ed. viii.th, Alf., WH, and is placed in the margin by Lach. In this <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> is the <span class="ital">conditional</span> particle and the sense is = “knowing as ye do that each, if he shall have done any good thing”. The Manuscripts constantly vary between <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>. In classical Greek the conditional <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>, <span class="ital">if</span>, took also the contracted form <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, especially in Thucydides and Plato, and this possibly is the explanation of the biblical use of <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> as = the <span class="ital">potential</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>. In any case the use of <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span>, attached to relative pronouns and adverbs, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐάν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅπου ἐάν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὗ ἐάν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁσάκις ἐάν</span>, etc., with the <span class="ital">potential</span> force, appears to occur (making all due allowance for uncertainties in the texts) with some frequency both in the LXX and in the NT, and it is found in the papyri; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Thayer-Grimm, <span class="ital">Lex.</span>, p. 168; Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of N.

Whether the Middle is to be taken as the <span class="ital">appropriative</span> Middle, expressing as it were the receiving back of a <span class="ital">deposit</span> (Ell.) is doubtful in view of the fact that in every NT occurrence but one (<a href="/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>) Middle forms are used.

For the Christian’s prospect of “reward,” cp. <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-4.htm" title="That your alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm" title="But love you your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="/luke/14-14.htm" title="And you shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.">Luke 14:14</a>; <a href="/context/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:...">Romans 2:6-10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>; &c. The essence of the truth is that the obedience of love is infallibly welcomed and remembered by Him to whom it is rendered. “Well done, good and faithful servant” (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>), is His certain ultimate response to every true act of the will given up to His will. This prospect, taken along with the conditions to it, has nothing that is not deeply harmonious with our justification for Christ’s Merit only, embraced by faith only. It is the recognition of love by Love, of grace by the Giver. From another point of view it is the outcome of a process of growth and result (<a href="/context/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap....">Galatians 6:7-9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord</span>] Christ. Cp. among many passages <a href="/context/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:...">Matthew 25:34-36</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="Why we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him....">2 Corinthians 5:9-10</a>.

For the slave the hope of reward is future - it is at the Lord's coming that he will have his reward. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall he receive (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>; compare <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>. </body></html>
