The ‘of’ here does not indicate apposition, as in the ‘shield of faith,’ or ‘the helmet of salvation,’ nor is it the ‘of’ of possession, so that the meaning is to be taken as being the sword which the Spirit wields, but it is the ‘of’ expressing origin, as in the ‘armour of God’; it is the sword which the Spirit supplies. The progress noted in the last sermon from subjective graces to objective divine facts, is completed here, for the sword which is put into the Christian soldier’s hand is the gift of God, even more markedly than is the helmet which guards his head in the day of battle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note what the word of God is.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The answer which would most commonly and almost unthinkingly be given is, I suppose, the Scriptures; but while this is on the whole true, it is to be noted that the expression employed here properly means a word spoken, and not the written record. Both in the Old and in the New Testaments the word of God means more than the Bible; it is the authentic utterance of His will in all shapes and applying to all the facts of His creation. In the Old Testament ‘God said’ is the expression in the first chapter of Genesis for the forthputting of the divine energy in the act of creation, and long ages after that divine poem of creation was written a psalmist re-echoed the thought when he said ‘For ever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in the heavens. Thou hast established the earth and it abideth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, further, the expression designates the specific messages which prophets and others received. These are not in the Old Testament spoken of as a unity: they are individual words rather than a word. Each of them is a manifestation of the divine will and purpose; many of them are commandments; some of them are warnings; and all, in some measure, reveal the divine nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That self-revelation of God reaches for us in this life its permanent climax, when He who ‘at sundry times and in divers manner spake unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by a Son.’ Jesus is the personal ‘word of God’ though that name by which He is designated in the New Testament is a different expression from that employed in our text, and connotes a whole series of different ideas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The early Christian teachers and apostles had no hesitation in taking that sacred name-the word of the Lord-to describe the message which they spoke. One of their earliest prayers when they were left alone was, that with all boldness they might speak Thy word; and throughout the whole of the Acts of the Apostles the preached Gospel is designated as the word of God, even as Peter in his epistle quotes one of the noblest of the Old Testament sayings, and declares that the ‘word of the Lord’ which ‘abideth for ever’ is ‘the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Clearly, then, Paul here is exhorting the Ephesian Christians, most of whom probably were entirely ignorant of the Old Testament, to use the spoken words which they had heard from him and other preachers of the Gospel as the sword of the Spirit. Since he is evidently referring to Christian teaching, it is obvious that he regards the old and the new as one whole, that to him the proclamation of Jesus was the perfection of what had been spoken by prophets and psalmists. He claims for his message and his brethren’s the same place and dignity that belonged to the former messengers of the divine will. He asserts, and all the more strongly, because it is an assertion by implication only, that the same Spirit which moved in the prophets and saints of former days is moving in the preachers of the Gospel, and that their message has a wider sweep, a deeper content, and a more radiant light than that which had been delivered in the past. The word of the Lord had of old partially declared God’s nature and His will: the word of God which Paul preached was in his judgment the complete revelation of God’s loving heart, the complete exhibition to men of God’s commandments of old; longing eyes had seen a coming day and been glad and confidently foretold it, now the message was ‘the coming one has come.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is as the record and vehicle of that spoken Gospel, as well as of its earlier premonitions, that the Bible has come to be called the word of God, and the name is true in that He speaks in this book. But much harm has resulted from the appropriation of the name exclusively to the book, and the forgetfulness that a vehicle is one thing and that which it carries quite another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The purpose and power of the word.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sword is the only offensive weapon in the list. The spear which played so great a part in ancient warfare is not named. It may well be noted that only a couple of verses before our text we read of the Gospel of peace, and that here with remarkable freedom of use of his metaphors, Paul makes the word of God, which as we have seen is substantially equivalent to the preached Gospel, the one weapon with which Christian men are to cut and thrust. Jesus said ‘I come not to send peace, but a sword,’ but Paul makes the apparent contradiction still more acute when he makes the very Gospel itself the sword. We may recall as a parallel, and possibly a copy of our text, the great words of the Epistle to the Hebrews which speak of the word of God as ‘living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.’ And we cannot forget the magnificent symbolism of the Book of Revelation which saw in the midst of the candlestick one like unto a Son of Man, and ‘out of His mouth proceeded a sharp, two-edged sword.’ That image is the poetic embodiment of our Lord’s own words which we have just quoted, and implies the penetrating power of the word which Christ’s gentle lips have uttered. Gracious and healing as it is, a Gospel of peace, it has an edge and a point which cut down through all sophistications of human error, and lay bare the ‘thoughts and intents of the heart.’ The revelation made by Christ has other purposes which are not less important than its ministering of consolation and hope. It is intended to help us in our fight with evil, and the solemn old utterance, ‘with the breath of His mouth He will slay the wicked,’ is true in reference to the effect of the word of Christ on moral evil. Such slaying is but the other side of the life-giving power which the word exercises on a heart subject to its influence. For the Christian soldier’s conflict with evil as threatening the health of his own Christian life, or as tyrannising over the lives of others, the sword of the Spirit is the best weapon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We are not to take the rough-and-ready method, which is so common among good people, of identifying this spirit-given sword with the Bible. If for no other reason, yet because it is the Spirit which supplies it to the grasp of the Christian soldier, our possession of it is therefore a result of the action of that Spirit on the individual Christian spirit; and what He gives, and we are to wield, is ‘the engrafted word which is able to save our souls.’ That word, lodged in our hearts, brings to us a revelation of duty and a chart of life, because it brings a loving recognition of the character of our Father, and a glad obedience to His will. If that word dwell in us richly, in all wisdom, and if we do not dull the edge of the sword by our own unworthy handling of it, we shall find it pierce to the ‘dividing asunder of joints and marrow,’ and the evil within us will either be cast out from us, or will shrivel itself up, and bury itself deep in dark corners.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Love to Christ will be so strong, and the things that are not seen will so overwhelmingly outweigh the things that are seen, that the solemn majesty of the eternal will make the temporal look to our awed eyes the contemptible unreality which it really is. They who humbly receive and faithfully use that engrafted word, have in it a sure touchstone against which their own sins and errors are shivered. It is for the Christian consciousness the true Ithuriel’s spear, at the touch of which ‘upstarts in his own shape the fiend’ who has been pouring his whispered poison into an unsuspicious ear. The standard weights and measures are kept in government custody, and traders have to send their yard measures and scales thither if they wish them tested; but the engrafted word, faithfully used and submitted to, is always at hand, and ready to pronounce its decrees, and to cut to the quick the evil by which the understanding is darkened and conscience sophisticated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The manner of its use.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here that is briefly but sufficiently expressed by the one commandment, ‘take,’ or perhaps more accurately, ‘receive.’ Of course, properly speaking, that exhortation does not refer to our manner of fighting with the sword, but to the previous act by which our hand grasps it. But it is profoundly true that if we take it in the deepest sense, the possession of it will teach the use of it. No instruction will impart the last, and little instruction is needed for the first. What is needed is the simple act of yielding ourselves to Jesus Christ, and looking to Him only, as our guide and strength. Before all Christian warfare must come the possession of the Christian armour, and the commandment that here lies at the beginning of all Paul’s description of it is ‘Take.’ Our fitness for the conflict all depends on our receiving God’s gift, and that reception is no mere passive thing, as if God’s grace could be poured into a human spirit as water is into a bucket. Hence, the translation of this commandment of Paul’s by ‘take’ is better than that by ‘receive,’ inasmuch as it brings into prominence man’s activity, though it gives too exclusive importance to that, to the detriment of the far deeper and more essential element of the divine action. The two words are, in fact, both needed to cover the whole ground of what takes place when the giving God and the taking man concur in the great act by which the Spirit of God takes up its abode in a human spirit. God’s gift is to be received as purely His gift, undeserved, unearned by us. But undeserved and unearned as it is, and given ‘without money and without price,’ it is not ours unless our hand is stretched out to take, and our fingers closed tightly over the free gift of God. There is a dead lift of effort in the reception; there is a still greater effort needed for the continued possession, and there is a life-long discipline and effort needed for the effective use in the struggle of daily life of the sword of the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If that engrafted word is ever to become sovereign in our lives, there must be a life-long attempt to bring the tremendous truths as to God’s will for human conduct which it plants in our minds into practice, and to bring all our practice under their influence. The motives which it brings to bear on our evils will be powerless to smite them, unless these motives are made sovereign in us by many an hour of patient meditation and of submission to their sweet and strong constraint. One sometimes sees on a wild briar a graft which has been carefully inserted and bandaged up, but which has failed to strike, and so the strain of the briar goes on and no rosebuds come. Are there not some of us who profess to have received the engrafted word and whose daily experience has proved, by our own continual sinfulness, that it is unable to ‘save our souls’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are in the Christian ranks some soldiers whose hands are too nerveless or too full of worldly trash to grasp the sword which they have received, much less to strike home with it at any of the evils that are devastating their own lives or darkening the world. The feebleness of the Christian conflict with evil, in all its forms, whether individual or social, whether intellectual or moral, whether heretical or grossly and frankly sensual, is mainly due to the feebleness with which the average professing Christians grasp the sword of the Spirit. When David asked the priests for weapons, and they told him that Goliath’s sword was lying wrapt in a cloth behind the ephod, and that they had none other, he said, ‘There is none like that, give it me.’ If we are wise, we will take the sword that lies in the secret place, and, armed with it, we shall not need to fear in any day of battle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We do well that we take heed to the word of God, ‘as unto a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn,’ when swords will be no more needed, and the Word will no longer shine in darkness but be the Light that makes the Sun needless for the brightness of the New Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Praying always </span>— As if he had said, And join prayer to all these graces, for your defence against your spiritual enemies, and that at all times, and on every occasion, in the midst of all employments, inwardly praying <span class="ital">without ceasing, </span><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" title="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>; <span class="ital">with all prayer </span>— Public and private, mental and vocal, ordinary and extraordinary, occasional and solemn.

Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praying always - It would be well for the soldier who goes forth to battle to pray - to pray for victory; or to pray that he may be prepared for death, should he fall. But soldiers do not often feel the necessity of this. To the Christian soldier, however, it is indispensable. Prayer crowns all lawful efforts with success and gives a victory when nothing else would. No matter how complete the armor; no matter how skilled we may be in the science of war; no matter how courageous we may be, we may be certain that without prayer we shall be defeated. God alone can give the victory; and when the Christian soldier goes forth armed completely for the spiritual conflict, if he looks to God by prayer, he may be sure of a triumph. This prayer is not to be intermitted. It is to be always. In every temptation and spiritual conflict we are to pray; see notes on <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>.<p>With all prayer and supplication - With all kinds of prayer; prayer in the closet, the family, the social meeting, the great assembly; prayer at the usual hours, prayer when we are specially tempted, and when we feel just like praying (see the notes, <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>) prayer in the form of supplication for ourselves, and in the form of intercession for others. This is, after all, the great weapon of our spiritual armor, and by this we may hope to prevail.<p>"Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;<p>Prayer makes the Christian armor bright,<p>And Satan trembles when he sees.<p>The meanest saint upon his knees."<p>In the Spirit - By the aid of the Holy Spirit; or perhaps it may mean that it is not to be prayer of form merely, but when the spirit and the heart accompany it. The former idea seems, however, to be the correct one.<p>And watching thereunto - Watching for opportunities to pray; watching for the spirit of prayer; watching against all those things which would hinder prayer; see the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>, note, 41, note; compare <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>.<p>With all perseverance - Never becoming discouraged and disheartened; compare notes, <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>.<p>And supplication for all saints - For all Christians. We should do this:<p>(1) because they are our brethren - though they may have a different skin, language, or name.<p>(2) because, like us, they have hearts prone to evil, and need, with us, the grace of God.<p>(3) because nothing tends so much to make us love others and to forget their faults, as to pray for them.<p>(4) because the condition of the church is always such that it greatly needs the grace of God. Many Christians have backslidden; many are cold or lukewarm; many are in error; many are conformed to the world; and we should pray that they may become more holy and may devote themselves more to God.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. always&#8212;Greek, "in every season"; implying opportunity and exigency (Col 4:2).

No, the <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ προσκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δεήσ</span>., in itself not essential, gives to his discourse the emphasis of earnestness and solemnity.

This clause is a further explanation of the manner in which the injunction <span class="greekheb">στῆτε οὖν</span> is to be carried. It is connected by some with the preceding <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span>; but it is not appropriate to the <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span>, which represents a single, definite act, while it is entirely suitable to the continuous attitude expressed by <span class="greekheb">στῆτε</span>. This great requirement of standing ready for the combat can be made good only when prayer, constant, earnest, spiritual prayer, is added to the careful equipment with all the parts of the panoply. Meyer would separate <span class="greekheb">προσευχόμενοι</span> from the <span class="greekheb">διὰ πάσης</span>, etc., and make it the beginning of a new, independent clause. His reason is that it is impossible to pray with <span class="ital">every</span> kind of prayer on <span class="ital">every occasion</span>. But the absoluteness of the statement is only of the kind that is often seen in Paul, as, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, when he charges us to pray <span class="greekheb">ἀδιαλείπτως</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm" title="Pray without ceasing.">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>). <span class="greekheb">διά</span> has the familiar sense of “by means of,” in the particular aspect of <span class="ital">formal cause</span>, the <span class="ital">manner</span> in which a thing is done (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">εἶπε διά παραβολῆς</span>, <a href="/luke/8-4.htm" title="And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:">Luke 8:4</a>; <span class="greekheb">εἶπε διὰ ὁράματος</span>, <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <span class="greekheb">τῷ λόγῳ διʼ ἐπιστολῶν</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, etc.; Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">Lex.</span>, p. 133). The <span class="greekheb">πάσης</span> has the force of “<span class="ital">every kind</span> of”. The distinction attempted to be drawn between <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> (= <span class="greekheb">תְּפִלָּה</span>) and <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> (= <span class="greekheb">תִּחְנָּה</span>), as between prayer for <span class="ital">blessing</span> and prayer for the withholding or removing of <span class="ital">evil</span>, cannot be made good. The only difference between the two terms appears to be that <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> means prayer in general, <span class="ital">precatio</span>, and <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span>, a special form of prayer, <span class="ital">petition, rogatio.</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ</span>: <span class="ital">in every season</span>. Not merely in the crisis of the conflict or on special occasions, but habitually, in all kinds of times.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>: <span class="ital">in the Spirit</span>. The reference is not to <span class="ital">our</span> spirit, as if = with <span class="ital">inward devoutness</span> or with <span class="ital">heart-felt</span> pleading (Erasm., Grot., etc.), nor as opposed to <span class="greekheb">βαττολογεῖν</span> (Chrys.), but “in the Holy Spirit,” the Holy Spirit being the sphere or element in which alone true prayer of all different kinds can proceed and from which it draws its inspiration; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the great statement on the <span class="ital">intercession</span> of the Spirit (<a href="/context/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered....">Romans 8:26-27</a>); also <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>, and especially <a href="/judges/1-20.htm" title="And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak.">Judges 1:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ προσευχόμενοι</span>. Thus the praying is defined in respect of its <span class="ital">variety</span> and <span class="ital">earnestness</span> (<span class="greekheb">διὰ πάσης</span>, etc.), its <span class="ital">constancy</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ</span>), and its <span class="ital">spiritual reality</span> or its “holy sphere” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Ell.).—<span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς αὐτὸ</span> [<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἀγρυπνοῦντες</span>: <span class="ital">and thereunto watching</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> of the TR inserted after <span class="greekheb">αὐτό</span> has the support only of such MSS. as [847]3J[848], etc.; it is omitted in [849] [850] [851], etc., while <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span> alone occurs in [852]*[853]. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, therefore, is to be deleted, as is done by LTTrWHRV. The <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοῦτο</span> refers not to what is to follow, as, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, to the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μοι δοθῇ</span> (Holzh.), but to what immediately precedes. The clause, therefore, attaches (by the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>) a more particular requirement to the general statement just made, specifying something that is to be done <span class="ital">with a view</span> (<span class="greekheb">εἰς τοῦτο</span>) to the fulfilment of the large injunction as to praying. That is <span class="ital">watchfulness, readiness</span>, and, as the next words state, watchfulness in <span class="ital">intercession</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγρυπνεῖν</span> = to <span class="ital">keep awake</span> or to <span class="ital">keep watch</span>, and then to be <span class="ital">attentive, vigilant</span> (<a href="/mark/13-33.htm" title="Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is.">Mark 13:33</a>; <a href="/luke/21-36.htm" title="Watch you therefore, and pray always, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.">Luke 21:36</a>), is much the same as <span class="greekheb">γρηγορεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">νήφειν</span>. So far as any distinction is made between them it may be that <span class="greekheb">ἀγρυπνεῖν</span> expresses <span class="ital">alertness</span> as opposed to <span class="ital">listlessness</span>, <span class="greekheb">γρηγορεῖν</span> watchfulness as the result of <span class="ital">effort</span>, and <span class="greekheb">νήφειν</span> <span class="ital">wariness</span>, the wakefulness that is safe against drowsiness (Sheldon Green, <span class="ital">Crit.

The verb, however, is found a number of times, both in profane Greek and in the NT, especially in Acts (<a href="/mark/3-9.htm" title="And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.">Mark 3:9</a>; <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/acts/8-13.htm" title="Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.">Acts 8:13</a>; <a href="/acts/10-7.htm" title="And when the angel which spoke to Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;">Acts 10:7</a>; <a href="/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a>; <a href="/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a>) in the sense of <span class="ital">giving heed to</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῇ προσευχῇ</span>, <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>, etc.), <span class="ital">continuing in</span>, etc. The <span class="ital">perseverance</span> or <span class="ital">stedfastness</span> in view is in the matter of prayer, so that the “in every kind of perseverance and supplication” is much the same as “in every kind of persevering supplication,” although in the case of a hendiadys proper the order would rather have been <span class="greekheb">ἐν δεήσει καὶ προσκαρτερήσει</span>.—<span class="greekheb">περὶ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων</span>: <span class="ital">for all the saints</span>. Thus in order to prayer of the kind described—prayer comprehensive, continuous, and moving in the domain of the Spirit of God, there must be <span class="ital">intercession</span> for all and <span class="ital">watchfulness</span> and <span class="ital">perseverance</span> in it.

The attitude of the believer’s mind is to be one of perpetual prayer, in the sense of continuously maintaining a trustful and humble reference of all parts of life to his Lord’s will and grace. This will express itself in acts, if only momentary and wholly internal acts, of adoration and petition at each felt crisis of need. See <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">by means of</span>; the expressions being the <span class="ital">instruments</span> of the spiritual state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all prayer and supplication</span>] “<span class="ital">All:</span>”—every variety; deliberate, ejaculatory; public, private, secret; confessing, asking, praising. Or again, more simply, with a full, not partial and niggardly, employment of the privilege and resource of prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Prayer” is the larger word, “supplication” the more definite. The former includes the whole attitude and action of the creature’s approach to God; the latter denotes only petition. “Prayer,” however, is very often used in this narrower sense. See out of many passages <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>; <a href="/luke/22-40.htm" title="And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.">Luke 22:40</a>.—The two words occur together, as here, <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Php 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Spirit</span>] So also R.

Cp. <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>; <a href="/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>; Judges 20.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">watching</span>] <span class="bld">Keeping awake</span>. The Gr. word occurs also <a href="/mark/13-33.htm" title="Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is.">Mark 13:33</a>; <a href="/luke/21-36.htm" title="Watch you therefore, and pray always, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.">Luke 21:36</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>. There was to be no indolent, somnolent oblivion of the need of prayer, or of the fact of offered prayer. For similar precepts (with another Gr. word) see <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm" title="Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1 Peter 4:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with all perseverance</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">in</span> (as R.

With a noble abruptness the thought, long detained upon the combat and resources of the individual, and of the single community, now runs out to the great circle of the Church. The inner connexion of ideas is close and strong. The Christian cannot really arm himself with Christ, and use his armour, without getting nearer in sympathy to the brotherhood of the saints of Christ. Cp. <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a> for the same connexion otherwise indicated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Saints:</span>”—see on <a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a> above.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ</span>, [<span class="ital">by</span>] <span class="ital">with</span>) As often as you pray, pray in the Spirit, inasmuch as He is at no time shut out from you.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With all prayer and supplication praying.</span> The metaphor of armor is now dropped, but not the idea of the conflict, for what is now insisted on is of the most vital importance for successful warfare. Though prayer is virtually comprehended in most of the previous exhortations, it is now specifically enjoined, and in a great variety of ways; "all prayer and supplication," equivalent to every form of it, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ejaculatory, secret, spoken, domestic, social, congregational. <span class="cmt_word">At all seasons.</span> No period of life should be without it - youth, middle life, old age, all demand it; no condition of life - adversity, prosperity, sunshine, desolation, under sore temptation, under important duty, under heavy trial, under all the changing circumstances of life, personal, social, Christian. See the hymn- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Go, when the morning shineth;<br />Go, when the noon is bright;<br />Go, when the day declineth;<br />Go, in the hush of night."</span> <span class="cmt_word">In the Spirit</span>; for true prayer is spiritual, and it is not true prayer unless by the Holy Spirit the heart is filled with heavenward longings and aspirations, changing our prayer from cold form to heartfelt realities. The ordinary habit of the soul should be prayerful, realizing the presence of God and looking for his grace and guidance. <span class="cmt_word">And watching thereunto</span>; that is, "towards" spirituality, against formality, as also against forgetfulness and neglect of prayer. Perhaps also the idea of watching <span class="accented">for the answer</span> is involved, as you wait for an answer when you have dispatched a letter. <span class="cmt_word">In all perseverance</span>; this being very specially needed to make prayer triumphant, as in the case of the Syro-phoenician mother, or in that of Monica, mother of Augustine, and many more. <span class="cmt_word">And prayer for all saints</span>; this being one of the great objects for which saints are gathered into the "one body" the Church, that they may be upheld and carried on, in warfare and in work, by mutual prayer, kept from slips and infirmities, and from deadly sins, and enabled one and all to "walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Always (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>Incorrect.
