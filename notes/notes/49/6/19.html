The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And for me - Paul was then a prisoner at Rome. He specially needed the prayers of Christians:<p>(1) that he might be sustained in his afflictions; and,<p>(2) that he might be able to manifest the spirit which he ought, and to do good as he had opportunity. Learn hence that we should pray for the prisoner, the captive, the man in chains, the slave. There are in this land (the United States) about ten thousand prisoners - husbands, fathers, sons, brothers; or wives, mothers, daughters. True, they are the children of "crime," but they are also the children of sorrow; and in either case or both they need our prayers. There are in this land not far from three million of slaves - and they need our prayers. They are children of misfortune and of many wrongs; they are sunk in ignorance and want and we; they are subjected to trials, and exposed to temptations to the lowest vices. But many of them, we trust, love the Redeemer; and whether they do or do not, they need an interest in the prayers of Christians.<p>That utterance may be given unto me - Paul, though a prisoner, was permitted to preach the gospel; see the notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30-31</a>.<p>That I may open my mouth boldly - He was in Rome. He was almost alone. He was surrounded by multitudes of the wicked. He was exposed to death. Yet he desired to speak boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and to invite sinners to repentance. A Christians in chains, and surrounded by the wicked, may speak boldly, and "may" have hope of success - for Paul was not an unsuccessful preacher even when a captive at Rome; see the notes on <a href="/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a>.<p>The mystery of the gospel - notes, <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. for me&#8212;a different Greek preposition from that in Eph 6:18; translate, therefore, "on my behalf."<p>that I may open my mouth boldly&#8212;rather, "that there may be given to me 'utterance,' or 'speech' in the opening of my mouth (when I undertake to speak; a formula used in set and solemn speech, Job 3:1; Da 10:16), so as with boldness to make known," &c. Bold plainness of speech was the more needed, as the Gospel is a "mystery" undiscoverable by mere reason, and only known by revelation. Paul looked for utterance to be given him; he did not depend on his natural or acquired power. The shortest road to any heart is by way of heaven; pray to God to open the door and to open your mouth, so as to avail yourself of every opening (Jer 1:7, 8; Eze 3:8, 9, 11; 2Co 4:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Utterance, </span> or speech, viz. both the things I am to speak, and the faculty of speaking as becomes the matter I deliver. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That I may open my mouth; </span> or, in or unto the opening of my mouth, i.e. full and free profession of the truth, without shame or fear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Boldly; </span> either, freely and confidently, the same as before in other words; or, openly and plainly, in opposition to speaking closely and in secret, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/8-32.htm" title="And he spoke that saying openly.

This shows the great humility of the apostle, and the sense he had of the greatness of the work of the ministry; and that it is the duty of people to pray for their ministers; and that no man is perfect in this life; and that the more superior members need the assistance of the inferior ones; for this request is made by the apostle not in dissimulation, or as feigning humility and modesty; but in the sincerity of his heart, and from a real sense of his need of fresh supplies of gifts and grace, to fit him for the work and service of Christ: <p>that utterance may be given unto me, or "that the word"; meaning not the subject matter of the ministry, the word of the Gospel, the word of faith, truth, and reconciliation, for that was committed to him; unless he should mean an increase of light and knowledge in it; but rather a faculty of speaking it freely and aptly, and what is commonly called elocution; not speaking with the enticing words of man's wisdom, but with the words of the Holy Ghost: or else an opportunity of preaching the word, and liberty to do it, as follows; <p>that I may open my mouth boldly; or "in the opening of my mouth"; the phrase is Rabbinical. The Jews (w) say, that when Moses came to write that passage, "let us make man in our image", &amp;c. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, he said before the Lord of the world, why dost thou give , "opening of the mouth", to heretics? i.e. an occasion to them of speaking, objecting to us, and of reproving and convincing us with respect to a plurality of persons in the Deity: and a little after they say, <p>"wherever you , "an opening of the mouth to heretics", you will find an answer by its side, or along with it.'' <p>Now the apostle desired he might have something to say, to object to, and to reprove and convince the unbelieving Jews; that he might do this with boldness, with all faithfulness with Courage, and intrepidity, and with freedom of speech; or "openly" and "publicly", as the Syriac version renders it: <p>to make known, the mystery of the Gospel; or the mysterious doctrines of it, such as the doctrines of a trinity of persons, of the union of the two natures in Christ, justification by his righteousness, regeneration by his Spirit and grace, the saints' union to Christ, and communion with him, the resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. which are called mysteries, because they were hid until revealed; and though revealed, the "modus" and "ratio" of them are not to be accounted for. Now the apostle's work was to make known these mysteries, to prove the truth of them from the word of God, and to defend them against the opposers of them; and that he might be able to do this he entreats the prayers of the saints. <p>(w) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 8. fol. 7. 1. &amp; Vajikra Rabba, sect. 21. fol. 163. 1.

Should we attach <span class="greekheb">ἐν παῤῥ</span>. to what precedes (Vatablus: “ut detur mihi aperto ore loqui libere, ut notum faciam,” etc.), <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσαι</span> would be without a necessary modal definition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[313] Grotius also regards the <span class="greekheb">ἄνοιξις τοῦ στόματος</span> as the act of God: “sic Deus labia aperire dicitur, ubi materiam suppeditat sibi gratias agendi, <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm" title="O Lord, open you my lips; and my mouth shall show forth your praise.">Psalm 51:15</a>,” yet makes out of it, after the Rabbinical פתחון פה (see Capell. Spicileg. p. 112; Buxtorf, Lex. Talm. p. 1872), occasione (loquendi) data. But the sense, “opportunity to speak,” could only so be brought out in the event of the words running thus: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μοι δοθῇ ἄνοιξις τοῦ στόματός μου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[314] “Ut ab hac custodia militari liber per omnem urbem perferre possem sermonem evang.,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> <span class="greekheb">δοθείη</span> were genuine, the statement of aim, introduced by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, would be adduced <span class="ital">from the mind of the persons praying</span>, thus in the character of the <span class="ital">oratio obliqua.</span> See on <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm" title="And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,">Ephesians 6:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">and for me</span>. <span class="greekheb">καί</span> has here its <span class="ital">adjunctive</span> force, in the special form of appending the particular to the general (Win.-Moult., p. 544), = “and for me in particular”. Paul passes from the requirement of intercession for all to that of intercession for himself, and that with a view to a special gift from God, to wit, freedom of utterance in preaching. The <span class="greekheb">περί</span> of the former clause becomes <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> in the present. This suggests the existence of some distinction between the two preps., and some have attempted to show that <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> alone expresses the idea of <span class="ital">care for</span> one, while <span class="greekheb">περί</span> denotes a more distant relation (Harl., etc.). But it is impracticable to establish either that or any other tangible distinction. <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> may be, generally speaking, more applicable to <span class="ital">persons</span>, and <span class="greekheb">περί</span> to <span class="ital">things</span>. But here both are used of persons. Even in classical Greek they were often used as if interchangeable (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Demosth., <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, ii., p. 74, 35), and in later Greek, both biblical and non-biblical, they seem to have lost any distinction they once may have had.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα μοι δοθείῃ</span> [<span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span>] <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>: <span class="ital">that to me may be given utterance</span>. The <span class="greekheb">δοθείῃ</span> of the TR rests on very slender cursive evidence; <span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span> is read by [854] [855] [856] [857] [858] [859] [860] [861] [862] [863], etc., and must be substituted. A few authorities place <span class="greekheb">μοι</span> <span class="ital">after</span> <span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span> ([864] [865], d, e, f, vg, Victor., etc.); but in most it is inserted <span class="ital">before</span> it. <span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span> has the position of emphasis—the utterance for which they were to pray in Paul’s behalf is regarded as a <span class="ital">gift</span> from God. For this use of <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνοίξει τοῦ στόματός μου</span>: <span class="ital">in opening my mouth</span>. Not “<span class="ital">that</span> I may open my mouth” (AV), but “<span class="ital">when</span> I open my mouth”. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> marks the <span class="ital">occasion</span> of the action, and the action itself is that in which the <span class="ital">gift</span> (<span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span>) of Divine help is sought. The phrase <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίγειν τὸ στόμα</span> does not of itself denote any special <span class="ital">kind</span> of utterance, whether <span class="ital">unreserved</span> (Calv., De Wette, etc.), <span class="ital">unpremeditated</span> (Oec.), or other. If it conveys in any case the idea of a certain <span class="ital">quality</span> of speech, that is due to the context; as in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>, where it is conjoined with the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται</span>. It means simply the opening of the mouth to speak, or the act of speaking; but both in the OT and in the NT it appears to have a certain <span class="ital">pathetic</span> (Mey.), or rather <span class="ital">solemn</span> force (Ell.), being used of grave and important utterances on which much depended (<a href="/job/3-1.htm" title="After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.">Job 3:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-16.htm" title="And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.">Daniel 10:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-2.htm" title="And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,">Matthew 5:2</a>; <a href="/acts/8-33.htm" title="In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.">Acts 8:33</a>; <a href="/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span>: <span class="ital">with boldness</span>.

The <span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span> of the TR has large support ([866] [867] [868] [869] [870] [871] [872], Vulg., Syr., Copt., etc.). It is omitted by [873] [874]gr[875], Victor., etc., and is deleted by LWH. The <span class="ital">gen.</span> is probably that of <span class="ital">contents</span>, or one of the various forms of the <span class="ital">gen. possess.</span>, = the mystery <span class="ital">contained in</span> the Gospel or <span class="ital">belonging to</span> it. On <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> see under <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> above.—The connection of the several clauses in this verse is variously understood. Some connect <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνοίξει τοῦ στόματός μου</span> with the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span>. So Grotius, who explains it thus—“ut ab hac custodia militari liber per omnem urbem perferre possem sermonem”; but <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> does not apply to freedom of <span class="ital">movement</span>, and here it has a sense in harmony with the following <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησιάσωμαι</span>. Others attach the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνοίξει</span> closely with the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> as a definition of it, = “that utterance may be given me by the opening of my mouth” (Cornel. à Lap., Harl., Olsh., Von Soden, Abb., etc.). This makes the “opening of the mouth” the act of <span class="ital">God</span>; in support of which interpretation appeal is made to the terms in <a href="/ezekiel/3-27.htm" title="But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that declines, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-21.htm" title="In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the middle of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 29:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-22.htm" title="Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:">Ezekiel 32:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm" title="O Lord, open you my lips; and my mouth shall show forth your praise.">Psalm 51:15</a>. The absence of the article, and the analogous passage in <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a> are also thought to favour this. But the terms in <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a> are different—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα Θεὸς ἀνοίξῃ ἡμῖν θύραν τοῦ λόγου</span>, and the construction makes the <span class="greekheb">δοθῇ</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἄνοιξις τοῦ στόματος</span> practically one and the same thing. The simplest constructions are these two—(1) to connect <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span> with what <span class="ital">precedes</span>, and with the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> not the <span class="greekheb">ἄνοιξις</span>, = “that utterance, and that with boldness, may be given to me when I undertake to open my mouth with a view to make known the mystery of the Gospel”; and (2) to connect <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span> with what follows, to wit, the <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσαι</span>, = “that to me utterance may be given when I open my mouth, that with boldness I may make known the mystery of the Gospel”. The latter is preferred by Meyer, Ell., WH, etc. It is followed by the RV text, “in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness,” etc.; while the RV margin gives “in opening my mouth with boldness, to make known the mystery,” etc. The former construction gives a good sense for each particular term and a simple connection, if the <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span> is taken to define not the <span class="ital">opening of the mouth</span>, but the <span class="ital">utterance</span>, the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, which is the main thought. On the whole the latter is perhaps to be preferred, the need of <span class="ital">utterance</span>, power of speech, when occasion offers itself to preach, being first mentioned, and this gift of utterance being next defined in respect of its object, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to give fearless confidence in making the Gospel known.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[854] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[855] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[856] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.
