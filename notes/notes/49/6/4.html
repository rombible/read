It denotes the exasperation produced by arbitrary and unsympathetic rule.<p><span class= "bld">Nurture and admonition of the Lord.</span>—In this phrase we have the two elements of education. “Nurture” is a word signifying generally “the treatment due to a child,” but by usage appropriated to practical training, or teaching by discipline; while “admonition” is the “putting children in mind” by word of instruction. It may be noted that in accordance with the characteristic sternness of ancient education, both words have a tinge of severity in them. The “nurture” of this passage is the same as the “chastening” of the famous passage in <a href="/context/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4-11</a>. (Compare the cognate verb in <a href="/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>.) The “admonition” is used in <a href="/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a> for rebuke, and, inasmuch as it implies warning, is distinguished from teaching in <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>. In this, as in other cases, Christianity gradually softened this stern authority of the father—so strikingly exemplified in the old Roman law—by the idea suggested in the addition of the phrase “of the Lord.” The children belong not to the parent only, but to Christ, taken into His arms in baptism, and sealed as His little ones. Hence the “reverence,” which Juvenal enforced in theory as due to children’s natural purity, become realised in Christian practice, and gradually transformed all Christian education to greater gentleness, forbearance, and love.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 The great duty of children is, to obey their parents. That obedience includes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every age prosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents. The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities. Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements and work upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper and compassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty God requires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of the gospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to the good lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. But those, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich and accomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for the blessing of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye fathers - A command addressed particularly to "fathers," because they are at the head of the family, and its government is especially committed to them. The object of the apostle here is, to show parents that their commands should be such that they can be easily obeyed, or such as are entirely reasonable and proper. If children are required to "obey," it is but reasonable that the commands of the parent should be such that they can be obeyed, or such that the child shall not be discouraged in his attempt to obey. This statement is in accordance with what he had said <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-25</a> of the relation of husband and wife. It was the duty of the wife to obey - but it was the corresponding duty of the husband to manifest such a character that it would be pleasant to yield obedience - so to love her, that his known wish would be law to her. In like manner it is the duty of children to obey a parent; but it is the duty of a parent to exhibit such a character, and to maintain such a government, that it would be proper for the child to obey; to command nothing that is unreasonable or improper, but to train up his children in the ways of virtue and pure religion.<p>Provoke not your children to wrath - That is, by unreasonable commands; by needless severity; by the manifestation of anger. So govern them, and so punish them - if punishment is necessary - that they shall not lose their confidence in you, but shall love you. The apostle here has hit on the very danger to which parents are most exposed in the government of their children. It is that of souring their temper; of making them feel that the parent is under the influence of anger, and that it is right for them to be so too. This is done:<p>(1) when the commands of a parent are unreasonable and severe. The spirit of a child then becomes irritated, and he is "discouraged;" <a href="/colossians/3-21.htm">Colossians 3:21</a>.<p>(2) when a parent is evidently "excited" when he punishes a child. The child then feels:<p>(a) that if his "father" is angry, it is not wrong for him to be angry; and,<p>(b) the very fact of anger in a parent kindles anger in his bosom - just as it does when two men are contending.<p>If he submits in the case, it is only because the parent is the "strongest," not because he is "right," and the child cherishes "anger," while he yields to power. There is no principle of parental government more important than that a father should command his own temper when he inflicts punishment. He should punish a child not because he is "angry," but because it is "right;" not because it has become a matter of "personal contest," but because God requires that he should do it, and the welfare of the child demands it. The moment when a child seem that a parent punishes him under the influence of anger, that moment the child will be likely to be angry too - and his anger will be as proper as that of the parent. And yet, how often is punishment inflicted in this manner! And how often does the child feel that the parent punished him simply because he was the "strongest," not because it was "right;" and how often is the mind of a child left with a strong conviction that wrong has been done him by the punishment which he has received, rather than with repentance for the wrong that he has himself done.<p>But bring them up - Place them under such discipline and instruction that they shall become acquainted with the Lord.<p>In the nurture - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  en paideia. The word used here means "training of a child;" hence education, instruction, discipline. Here it means that they are to train up their children in such a manner as the Lord approves; that is, they are to educate them for virtue and religion.<p>And admonition - The word used here - &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  nouthesia means literally, "a putting in mind," then warning, admonition, instruction. The sense here is, that they were to put them in mind of the Lord - of his existence, perfections, law, and claims on their hearts and lives. This command is positive, and is in accordance with all the requirements of the Bible on the subject. No one can doubt that the Bible enjoins on parents the duty of endeavoring to train up their children in the ways of religion, and of making it the grand purpose of this life to prepare them for heaven. It has been often objected that children should be left on religious subjects to form their own opinions when they are able to judge for themselves. Infidels and irreligious people always oppose or neglect the duty here enjoined; and the plea commonly is, that to teach religion to children is to make them prejudiced; to destroy their independence of mind; and to prevent their judging as impartially on so important a subject as they ought to. In reply to this, and in defense of the requirements of the Bible on the subject, we may remark:<p>(1) That to suffer a child to grow up without any instruction in religion, is about the same as to suffer a garden to lie without any culture. Such a garden would soon be overrun with weeds, and briars, and thorns - but not sooner, or more certainly, than the mind of a child would.<p>(2) people do instruct their children in a great many things, and why should they not in religion? They teach them how to behave in company; the art of farming; the way to make or use tools; how to make money; how to avoid the arts of the cunning seducer. But why should it not be said that all this tends to destroy their independence, and to make them prejudiced? Why not leave their minds open and free, and suffer them to form their own judgments about farming and the mechanic arts when their minds are matured?<p>(3) people do inculcate their own sentiments in religion. An infidel is not usually "very" anxious to conceal his views from his children. People teach by example; by incidental remarks; by the "neglect" of that which they regard as of no value. A man who does not pray, is teaching his children not to pray; he who neglects the public worship of God, is teaching his children to neglect it; he who does not read the Bible, is teaching his children not to read it. Such is the constitution of things, that it is impossible for a parent not to inculcate his own religious views on his children. Since this is so, all that the Bible requires is, that his instructions should be right.<p>(4) to inculcate the truths of religion is not to make the mind narrow, prejudiced, and indisposed to perceive the truth. Religion makes the mind candid, conscientious, open to conviction, ready to follow the truth. Superstition, bigotry, infidelity, and "all" error and falsehood, make the mind narrow and prejudiced.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. fathers&#8212;including mothers; the fathers are specified as being the fountains of domestic authority.

We have now the statement of parental duty on the positive side. <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρέφειν</span> has here obviously the sense of <span class="ital">bringing up</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/proverbs/23-24.htm" title="The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begets a wise child shall have joy of him.">Proverbs 23:24</a>), not that of <span class="ital">nourishing</span> as in <a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm" title="For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:">Ephesians 5:29</a> above. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not <span class="ital">instrumental</span> here but <span class="ital">local</span>, denoting the ethical <span class="ital">sphere</span> or <span class="ital">element</span> in which the <span class="greekheb">παιδεία</span> and the <span class="greekheb">νουθεσία</span> take place. <span class="greekheb">παιδεία</span> in classical Greek means <span class="ital">education</span>, the whole <span class="ital">instruction</span> and <span class="ital">training</span> of youth, including the training of the <span class="ital">body</span>. In the NT as also in the OT and the Apocrypha <span class="greekheb">παιδεία</span> and its verb <span class="greekheb">παιδεύειν</span> mean education <span class="ital">per molestias</span> (Aug., <span class="ital">Enarr.</span>, in <a href="/psalms/119-66.htm" title="Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed your commandments.">Psalm 119:66</a>), <span class="ital">discipline</span>, instruction by <span class="ital">correction</span> or <span class="ital">chastening</span> (<a href="/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm" title="And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:">Hebrews 12:5</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/12-7.htm" title="If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?...">Hebrews 12:7-8</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/leviticus/26-18.htm" title="And if you will not yet for all this listen to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-1.htm" title="O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 6:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/4-17.htm" title="For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her laws.">Sir 4:17</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/22-6.htm" title="A tale out of season is as musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are never out of time.">Sir 22:6</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-12.htm" title="Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.">2Ma 6:12</a>). Of the general Greek sense there is but one instance in the case of the <span class="ital">verb</span> in the NT (<a href="/acts/7-22.htm" title="And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.">Acts 7:22</a>); and as regards the <span class="ital">noun</span> the passage in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm" title="All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:">2 Timothy 3:16</a> suits the idea of <span class="ital">disciplinary</span> instruction. There is no reason, therefore, for departing from the usual biblical sense of the word here, or for giving it the wide sense of <span class="ital">all</span> that makes the education of children. The term <span class="greekheb">νουθεσία</span>, not entirely strange to classical Greek (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Aristoph., <span class="ital">Ranae</span>, 1009), but current rather in later Greek (Philo, Joseph., etc.) in place of the earlier form <span class="greekheb">νουθέτησις</span> (<span class="greekheb">νουθετία</span> also appearing to occur occasionally), means <span class="ital">admonition</span>, training by <span class="ital">word</span>, and in actual use, mostly, though not necessarily, by word of reproof, remonstrance or blame (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Trench, <span class="ital">NT Syn.</span>, pp. 104–108). The Vulg. translates very well, “in disciplina et correptione”. The distinction, therefore, between the two terms is not that between the <span class="ital">general</span> and the <span class="ital">special</span> (Mey.), but rather that between training by <span class="ital">Acts and discipline</span> and training by <span class="ital">word</span> (Ell.). The <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου</span> is taken by some as the <span class="ital">gen. obj.</span>, = “about Christ” (so the Greek commentators generally); by others as = “according to the doctrine of Christ” (Erasm., Est., etc.), or as = “worthy of the Lord” (Matthies). But it is best understood either as the <span class="ital">possess. gen.</span> or as the <span class="ital">gen.</span> of <span class="ital">origin</span>, = “the Lord’s discipline and admonition,” <span class="ital">i.e., Christian</span> training, the training that is of Christ, proceeding from Him and prescribed by Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">fathers</span>] We may equally well render, <span class="bld">parents</span>. Moses’ parents are called (<a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a>, Gr.) his <span class="ital">fathers</span>. The expression is found in the classics, Greek and Latin.—The father is the head of authority in the home, but the oneness of husband and wife, to speak of that only, secures the high authority of the mother also. This is assumed in the Fifth Commandment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">provoke not … to wrath</span>] The same word occurs <a href="/colossians/3-21.htm" title=" Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.">Colossians 3:21</a>, and the cognate noun above, <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm" title="Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:">Ephesians 4:26</a>, where see note. In Col. the suggestive words follow, “lest they be discouraged.” The precept and the reason are both full of holy wisdom.—Here, as in the section on Marriage, observe how the two parties are reminded each exclusively of his own <span class="ital">duties</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>At the present time, undoubtedly, parental authority is at a low ebb in English Christendom. Its revival will depend, under God, on the active recognition of the whole teaching of such a Scripture as this, full of the warrant of parental government, and of the wisdom of parental sympathy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bring them up</span>] The Gr. conveys the idea of <span class="ital">development</span> (here in the sphere of character and principle) by <span class="ital">care and pains</span>. The same word has occurred <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29</a>, with reference to bodily development.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nurture</span>] Better, <span class="bld">discipline</span>. “Chastening” (R.V.) seems to us too narrow a word, at least in its ordinary sense of <span class="ital">punitive</span> discipline. It is true that in the leading N.T. passage of the kind (<a href="/context/hebrews/12-5.htm" title="And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:...">Hebrews 12:5-10</a>; and cp. <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>) the word (or its kindred verb) obviously conveys that idea. And the verb is used of the terrible “chastisement” of the Roman scourge (<a href="/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>; <a href="/luke/23-22.htm" title="And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.">Luke 23:22</a>). But a wider meaning is, by usage, quite lawful, and it is certainly in point here. All the wholesome <span class="ital">restraints</span> of a wise early education are in view; all training in the direction of a life modest, unselfish, and controlled. Such will be the discipline of the true Christian home, and of its partial extension, the true Christian school.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">admonition</span>] The Gr. noun recurs <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>. For the kindred Gr. verb, see <a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/romans/15-14.htm" title="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" title="Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm" title="Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>.

The first counsel on the subject is negative, and probably has respect to a common pagan habit, against which Christians needed to be put on their guard. Irritation of children was common, through loss of temper and violence in reproving them, through capricious and unsteady treatment and unreasonable commands; but more especially (what is still so common) by the parents being violently angry when the children, inconsiderately, perhaps, disturbed or annoyed them, rather than when they deliberately did wrong. All this the apostle deprecates. <span class="cmt_word">But bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are not easily defined in this connection; the former is thought to denote the discipline of training, with its appropriate rewards and punishments; the latter, instruction. Both are to be "of the Lord," such as he inspires and approves. Instilling sound principles of life, training to good habits, cautioning and protecting against moral dangers, encouraging prayer, Bible-reading, church-going, sabbath-keeping; taking pains to let them have good associates, and especially dealing with them prayerfully and earnestly, in order that they may accept Christ as their Savior and follow him, - are among the matters included in this counsel. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Nurture and admonition (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; from &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; a child. In classical usage, that which is applied to train and educate a Child. So Plato: "Education (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the constraining and directing of youth toward that right reason which the law affirms, and which the experience of the best of our elders has agreed to be truly right" ("Laws," 659). In scriptural usage another meaning has come into it and its kindred verb &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, which recognizes the necessity of correction or chastisement to thorough discipline. So <a href="/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-8</a>. In <a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a> &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; occurs in the original classical sense: "Moses was instructed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;) in all the wisdom," etc. The term here covers all the agencies which contribute to moral and spiritual training. Discipline is better than Rev., chastening. &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; admonition occurs only here, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, and <a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>. The kindred verb &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to warn or admonish, is found only in Paul's letters, with the single exception of <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a> (see note). Its distinctive feature is training by word of mouth, as is shown by its classical usage in connection with words meaning to exhort or teach. Xenophon uses the phrase &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; admonitory words. Yet it may include monition by deed. Thus Plato, speaking of public instruction in music, says that the spectators were kept quiet by the admonition of the wand (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, "Laws," 700). He also uses the phrase &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to admonish with blows. It includes rebuke, but not necessarily. Trench happily illustrates the etymological sense (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; the mind, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9; to put): "Whatever is needed to cause the monition to be laid to heart." Admonition is a mode of discipline, so that the two words nurture and admonition stand related as general and special.<p>Of the Lord<p>Such discipline as is prescribed by the Lord and is administered in His name. </body></html>
