In <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a> we have first the general word “prayer,” and then the two chief elements of worship, <span class= "ital">“</span>supplication with thanksgiving.” It is by prayer that all the heavenly armour is put on.<p><span class= "bld">In the Spirit.</span>—That is, “in the Spirit of God” (as in <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>). Compare the relation of prayer to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in <a href="/context/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26-27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And watching thereunto with all perseverance.</span>—These words in themselves obviously supply the other part of our Lord’s command, “Watch and pray,” naturally apposite to the consideration of the Christian warfare. “Perseverance” implies exertion, holding out against fatigue and difficulty. The corresponding verb is used in relation to all kinds of spiritual labour (see <a href="/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/acts/8-13.htm" title="Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.">Acts 8:13</a>); but especially in connection with prayer (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a>). Perhaps from this frequent connection St. Paul is induced to add to it “supplication,” and this time “for all saints,” so leading on to his usual request for the prayers of his brethren. For this he is willing to sacrifice some part of the perfect appropriateness of idea; since the whole picture hitherto has been of the fight, waged by each for himself (although side by side with others), in the combined power of watchfulness and prayer for God’s help.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 The great duty of children is, to obey their parents. That obedience includes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every age prosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents. The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities. Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements and work upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper and compassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty God requires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of the gospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to the good lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. But those, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich and accomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for the blessing of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Honour thy father and mother - see <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; compare notes on <a href="/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>.<p>Which is the first commandment with promise - With a promise annexed to it. The promise was, that their days should be long in the land which the Lord their God would give them. It is not to be supposed that the observance of the four first commandments would not be attended with a blessing, but no particular blessing is promised. It is true, indeed, that there is a "general declaration" annexed to the second commandment, that God would show mercy to thousands of generations of them that loved him and that kept his commandments. But that is rather a declaration in regard to all the commands of God than a promise annexed to that specific commandment. It is an assurance that obedience to the law of God would be followed with blessings to a thousand generations, and is given in view of the first and second commandments together, because they related particularly to the honor that was due to God. But the promise in the fifth commandment is a "special promise." It does not relate to obedience to God in general, but it is a particular assurance that they who honor their parents shall have a particular blessing as the result of that obedience. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Here the authority of revealed law is added to that of natural law.<p>which is &#8230; promise&#8212;The "promise" is not made the main motive to obedience, but an incidental one. The main motive is, because it is God's will (De 5:16, "Honor thy father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath COMMANDED thee"); and that it is so peculiarly, is shown by His accompanying it "with a promise."<p>first&#8212;in the decalogue with a special promise. The promise in the second commandment is a general one. Their duty is more expressly prescribed to children than to parents; for love descends rather than ascends [Bengel].

This explains who parents are, and points at some branches of obedience due unto them; for they are not only to be loved, and to be feared, and reverenced, their corrections to be submitted to, offences against them to be acknowledged, their tempers to be bore with, and their infirmities covered; but they are to be honoured in thought, word, and gesture; they are to be highly thought of and esteemed; they are to be spoken to, and of, very honourably, and with great veneration and to be behaved to in a very respectful manner; and they are to be relieved, assisted, and maintained in comfortable way when aged, and in necessitous circumstances; and which may be chiefly designed.

Just as little is it to be objected that <span class="ital">no</span> further commandment with a promise <span class="ital">follows</span> in the Decalogue; for Paul says <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, having before his mind not only the Decalogue, but also <span class="ital">the entire series of all the divine precepts</span>, which begins with the Decalogue. Among the commandments, which God has given at the time of the Mosaic legislation and in all the subsequent period, the commandment: “Honour father and mother,” is the first which is given with a promise. The apparent objection is thus removed in a simple manner by our taking <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> as <span class="ital">divine commandment</span> in general, and not restricting it to the sense “commandment in the Decalogue.” If Paul had had <span class="ital">merely</span> the Decalogue in mind, he must have written: the <span class="ital">only</span> commandment.[293] For the assumption that “it is the first, not with regard to those which follow, but to those which have preceded” (Harless), would not even be necessarily resorted to, if it were really established—which, however, is assumed entirely without proof—that Paul had taken into account <span class="ital">merely</span> the ten commandments, seeing that he and every one of his readers <span class="ital">knew</span> that no other commandment of the ten had a promise. From the arbitrary presupposition, that <span class="ital">merely</span> the Decalogue was taken into account, it followed of necessity in the case of <span class="ital">other</span> expositors, either that they restricted <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> simply to the commandments of the <span class="ital">second table</span>[294] (Ambrosiaster, Zachariae, Michaelis, the latter misconstruing the absence of the article before <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴ πρώτη</span> as favouring his view), in connection with which Holzhausen even maintained that <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> never denotes a commandment in reference to God (see <a href="/matthew/22-36.htm" title="Master, which is the great commandment in the law?">Matthew 22:36</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-38.htm" title="This is the first and great commandment.">Matthew 22:38</a>; <a href="/mark/12-28.htm" title="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?">Mark 12:28</a>); or else that they tampered with the numerical sense of <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, and made out of it a <span class="ital">very important, a chief commandment</span> (Koppe, Morus, Flatt, Matthies, Meier). What a feeble motive would thus result! and <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> would in fact mean <span class="ital">the most important</span>, which, however, the fifth commandment is <span class="ital">not</span> (<a href="/matthew/22-38.htm" title="This is the first and great commandment.">Matthew 22:38</a>; <a href="/context/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself....">Romans 13:9-10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a>). Further, the proposal of Erasmus, that <span class="greekheb">πρώτη ἐν ἐπαγγελ</span>. should be held to apply to the <span class="ital">definite</span> promise of <a href="/ephesians/6-3.htm" title="That it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.">Ephesians 6:3</a>, mention of which <span class="ital">first</span> occurs in the fifth commandment, is not worthy of attention (Harless), but erroneous; because the same promise occurs <span class="ital">after</span> the fifth commandment only with a <span class="ital">general</span> reference to the commandments <span class="ital">as a whole</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm" title="You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm" title="That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>), as it has also occurred even <span class="ital">before</span> the fifth commandment in such a general form (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>); and because, besides, <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγ</span>. could not but have the <span class="ital">article</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπαγγελ</span>.] is to be closely attached to <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, as expressing that, <span class="ital">wherein</span> this commandment is the first, the point in which the predicate pertains to it. Comp. Diodor. xii. 37: <span class="greekheb">ἐν δὲ εὐγενείᾳ καὶ πλούτῳ πρῶτος</span>, Soph. <span class="ital">O. R</span>. 33: <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος ἐν συμφοραῖς</span>. <span class="ital">In point of promise</span> it is the first (<span class="greekheb">οὐ τῇ τάξει</span>, Chrysostom).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[293] According to Bleek, Paul had not at the moment the form of the following commandments of the Decalogue definitely before his mind. But with such inadvertence no one is less to be charged than Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[294] In opposition to this, Erasmus aptly remarks: “Haec distinctio non est fundata in s. literis, sed est commentum recentiorum theologorum.” In general it is to be observed that, according to Philo and Josephus, each of the two tables contained <span class="ital">five</span> commandments, not, as Augustine (whom Luther followed) supposed, the first <span class="ital">three</span>, and the second <span class="ital">seven</span>,—and thus two sacred numbers, in which case, moreover, there was found in the first table a reference to the Trinity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm" title="Honor your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;">Ephesians 6:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα</span>: <span class="ital">honour thy father and mother</span>. Obedience is the <span class="ital">duty; honour</span> is the <span class="ital">disposition</span> of which the obedience is born. The authoritative terms of the OT Law (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>), given in the exact words of the LXX, are adopted in order to enforce regard for that disposition.—<span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη ἐν ἐπαγγελίᾳ</span>: <span class="ital">which is the first commandment in point of promise</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> may have here a simply <span class="ital">explanatory</span> force (so Ell., who renders it “the which”; Abb., “for such is”) rather than the qualitative sense, or the casual, “seeing it is”. But even its <span class="ital">explanatory</span> use suggests a <span class="ital">reason</span> for the fulfilment of the commandment. The prep. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is understood by some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Alf.) to be the local <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, expressing the <span class="ital">sphere</span> of the commandment, and so conveying the idea of being “accompanied by”. But more probably it expresses the simple sense of <span class="ital">relation</span>, “in regard of,” “in point of” (Mey., Ell.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 488). <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, like other ordinals, being specific enough in itself, dispenses with the article. But what is meant by this definition of the fifth commandment as the <span class="ital">first</span> in point of promise? The <span class="ital">second</span> commandment also has a kind of promise. But if that commandment is discounted because its promise is general, not peculiar to itself, but applicable to all, and if the fifth alone has attached to it a promise relevant to itself, why is it called the “first” and not rather the “only” commandment in point of promise? Some meet the difficulty by supposing it to mean the <span class="ital">first</span> in the second table (Mich., etc.). But in the second table it would still be not only the <span class="ital">first</span> but the <span class="ital">only</span> one of the kind; and if the Jewish division of the Decalogue, which assigned <span class="ital">five</span> commandments to each of the two tables, reaches thus far back, it would not be even in the second table. Nor can <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> be taken in the sense of first in <span class="ital">importance</span>; for it is never described as such (<span class="ital">cf. per contra</span> <a href="/matthew/22-38.htm" title="This is the first and great commandment.">Matthew 22:38</a>; <a href="/context/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself....">Romans 13:9-10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a>). The most probable explanation is that Paul has not the Decalogue alone in view, but the whole series of Divine Commandments, Mosaic and later (Mey., etc.). Westcott and Hort notice another possible pointing, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπαγγελίᾳ</span>, = “the which is the first commandment, with the promise that,” etc. But this still leaves it unexplained why this commandment is called the <span class="ital">first</span>. The whole sentence is dealt with as a parenthesis by the RV. But this is to miss the real point of the statement, which is to advance from the duty of <span class="ital">obedience</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὑπακούετε</span>) enforced by its relation to the requirement of law (the <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>), to the higher idea of filial <span class="ital">honour</span> as inculcated in the highest summary of Divine Law, the Decalogue. The <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> clause, therefore, is an integral part of the statement, and instead of being a remark by the way conveys an advance in the thought.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Honour</span>, &c.] <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>. The Gr. here is verbatim that of the LXX.

The commandment respecting the profanation of the name of God has a threatening. For our duties to God are especially due, and most necessary; therefore they are guarded with such sanctions: our duties towards men are due in a less degree to men, and so far [in that point of view] are not so necessary; they have therefore a promise attached to them. The commandment about honouring parents, of which Paul is speaking, has a peculiar promise above them all, if we look at the whole Decalogue: if we look only at the second table, it also alone has a promise; moreover, it is the first with a promise, even in respect to all the commandments, subsequent to the Decalogue. And very properly so, too; for, taking for granted the pious affection of parents in training their children to submit to the commandments of God, the honour, which is shown to parents chiefly by obedience, includes obedience to all the commandments in the early period of life. This apostolic observation is a proof that the observance of the law in the New Testament is not abolished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[94] Beng. joins in one <span class="ital">our</span> first and second commandment (it being the second to which a threat and a promise are attached; whereas to our <span class="ital">first</span> commandment there is attached neither).—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise).</span> The exhortation, based on natural morality (ver. 1), is here confirmed from the Decalogue. "Honor" is higher than obedience (ver. 1); it is the regard due to those who, by Divine appointment, are above us, and to whom our most respectful consideration is due. Father and mother, though not quite on a footing of equality in their relation to each other (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>), are equal as objects of honor and obedience to their children. It is assumed here that they are Christians; where one was a Christian and not the ether, the duty would be modified. But in these succinct verses the apostle lays down general rules, and does not complicate his exhortations with exceptions. The latter part of the verse contains a special reason for the precept; it is the first commandment <span class="accented">with a promise attached</span>. But obviously the apostle meant more than this; for as in ver. I he had affirmed the duty to be one of natural religion, so here he means to add that it is also part of <span class="accented">the revealed will</span> of God - it is one of the commandments; but still further, it is the first commandment <span class="accented">with a promise</span>. It may, perhaps, be said that this is appealing, not to the higher, but to the lower part of our nature - to our selfishness, not our goodness; but it is not an appeal to one part of our nature to the exclusion of the rest; it is an appeal <span class="accented">to our whole nature</span>, for it is a part of our nature to expect that in the end virtue will be rewarded and vice punished. In the case of children it is difficult to look far forward; the rewards and the punishments, to be influential, must be within the ken of vision, as it were; therefore it is quite suitable that, in writing to them, the apostle should lay emphasis on a promise which had its special fulfillment in the life that now is. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Honor thy father, etc.<p>To what is essentially right the divine ordinance is added. Compare Aeschylus: "For the reverence of parents, this is written third in the laws of much-venerated justice" ("Suppliants," 687-689).
