It is found in a comparatively incomplete form in his earliest epistle, the first to the Thessalonians, in which the children of the day are exhorted to put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. It reappears, in a slightly varied form, in the Epistle to the Romans, where those whose salvation is nearer than when they believed, are exhorted, because the day is at hand, to cast off, as it were, their night-gear, and to put on the ‘armour of light’; and here, in this Epistle of the Captivity, it is most fully developed. The Roman legionary, to whom Paul was chained, here sits all unconsciously for his portrait, every detail of which is pressed by Paul into the service of his vivid imagination; the virtues and graces of the Christian character, which are ‘the armour of light,’ are suggested to the Apostle by the weapon which the soldier by his side wore. The vulgarest and most murderous implements assume a new character when looked upon with the eyes of a poet and a Christian. Our present text constitutes the general introduction to the great picture which follows, of ‘the panoply of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We must be ready for times of special assaults from evil.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Most of us feel but little the stern reality underlying the metaphor, that the whole Christian life is warfare, but that in that warfare there are crises, seasons of special danger. The interpretation which makes the ‘evil day’ co-extensive with the time of life destroys the whole emphasis of the passage: whilst all days are days of warfare, there will be, as in some prolonged siege, periods of comparative quiet; and again, days when all the cannon belch at once, and scaling ladders are reared on every side of the fortress. In a long winter there are days sunny and calm followed, as they were preceded, by days when all the winds are let loose at once. For us, such times of special danger to Christian character may arise from temporal vicissitudes. Joy and prosperity are as sure to occasion them as are sorrows, for to Paul the ‘evil day’ is that which especially threatens moral and spiritual character, and these may be as much damaged by the bright sunshine of prosperity as by the midwinter of adversity, just as fierce sunshine may be as fatal as killing frost. They may also arise, without any such change in circumstances, from some temptation coming with more than ordinary force, and directed with terrible accuracy to our weakest point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These evil days are ever wont to come on us suddenly; they are heralded by no storm signals and no falling barometer. We may be like soldiers sitting securely round their camp fire, till all at once bullets begin to fall among them. The tiger’s roar is the first signal of its leap from the jungle. Our position in the world, our ignorance of the future, the heaped-up magazines of combustibles within, needing only a spark, all lay us open to unexpected assaults, and the temptation comes stealthily, ‘as a thief in the night.’ Nothing is so certain as the unexpected. For these reasons, then, because the ‘evil day’ will certainly come, because it may come at any time, and because it is most likely to come ‘when we look not for it,’ it is the dictate of plain common sense to be prepared. If the good man of the house had known at what hour the thief would have come, he would have watched; but he would have been a wiser man if he had watched all the more, because he did not know at what hour the thief would come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. To withstand these we must be armed against them before they come.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The main point of the exhortation is this previous preparation. It is clear enough that it is no time to fly to our weapons when the enemy is upon us. Aldershot, not the battlefield, is the place for learning strategy. Belshazzar was sitting at his drunken feast while the Persians were marching on Babylon, and in the night he was slain. When great crises arise in a nation’s history, some man whose whole life has been preparing him for the hour starts to the front and does the needed work. If a sailor put off learning navigation till the wind was howling and a reef lay ahead, his corpse would be cast on the cruel rocks. It is well not to be ‘over-exquisite,’ to cast the fashion of ‘uncertain evils,’ but certain ones cannot be too carefully anticipated, nor too sedulously prepared for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The manner in which this preparation is to be carried out is distinctly marked here. The armour is to be put on before the conflict begins. Now, without anticipating what will more properly come in considering subsequent details, we may notice that such a previous assumption implies mainly two things-a previous familiarity with God’s truth, and a previous exercise of Christian virtues. As to the former, the subsequent context speaks of taking the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and of having the loins girt with truth, which may be objective truth. As to the latter, we need not elaborate the Apostle’s main thought that resistance to sudden temptations is most vigorous when a man is accustomed to goodness. One of the prophets treats it as being all but impossible that they who have been accustomed to evil shall learn to do well, and it is at least not less impossible that they who have been accustomed to do well shall learn to do evil. Souls which habitually walk in the clear spaces of the bracing air on the mountains of God will less easily be tempted down to the shut-in valleys where malaria reigns. The positive exercise of Christian graces tends to weaken the force of temptation. A mind occupied with these has no room for it. Higher tastes are developed which makes the poison sweetness of evil unsavoury, and just as the Israelites hungered for the strong, coarse-smelling leeks and garlic of Egypt, and therefore loathed ‘this light bread,’ so they whose palates have been accustomed to manna will have little taste for leeks and garlic. The mental and spiritual activity involved in the habitual exercise of Christian virtues will go far to make the soul unassailable by evil. A man, busily occupied, as the Apostle would have us to be, may be tempted by the devil, though less frequently the more he is thus occupied; but one who has no such occupations and interests tempts the devil. If our lives are inwardly and secretly honeycombed with evil, only a breath will be needed to throw down the structure. It is possible to become so accustomed to the calm delights of goodness, that it would need a moral miracle to make a man fall into sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. To be armed with this armour, we must get it from God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though it consists mainly of habitudes and dispositions of our own minds, none the less have we to receive these from above. It is ‘the panoply of God,’ therefore we are to be endued with it, not by exercises in our own strength, but by dependence on Him. In old days, before a squire was knighted, he had to keep a vigil in the chapel of the castle, and through the hours of darkness to watch his armour and lift his soul to God, and we shall never put on the armour of light unless in silence we draw near to Him who teaches our hands to war and our fingers to fight. Communion with Christ, and only communion with Christ, receives from Him the life which enables us to repel the diseases of our spirits. What He imparts to those who thus wait upon Him, and to them only, is the Spirit which helps their infirmities and clothes their undefended nakedness with a coat of mail. If we go forth to war with evil, clothed and armed only with what we can provide, we shall surely be worsted in the fray. If we go forth into the world of struggle from the secret place of the Most High, ‘no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper,’ and we shall be more than conquerors through Him that loved us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But waiting on God to receive our weapons from Him is but part of what is needful for our equipment. It is we who have to gird our loins and put on the breastplate, and shoe our feet, and take the shield of faith, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. The cumbrous armour of old days could only be put on by the help of another pulling straps, and fixing buckles, and lifting and bracing heavy shields on arms, and fastening helmets upon heads; but we have, by our own effort, to clothe ourselves with God’s great gift, which is of no use to us, and is in no real sense ours, unless we do. It takes no small effort to keep ourselves in the attitude of dependence and receptivity, without which none of the great gifts of God come to us, and, least of all, the habitual practice of Christian virtues. The soldier who rushed into the fight, leaving armour and arms huddled together on the ground, would soon fall, and God’s giving avails nothing for our defence unless there is also our taking. It is the woful want of taking the things that are freely given to us of God, and of making our own what by His gift is our own, that is mainly responsible for the defeats of which we are all conscious. Looking back on our own evil days, we must all be aware that our defeats have mainly come from one or other of the two errors which lie so near us all, and which are intimately connected with each other-the one being that of fighting in our own strength, and the other being that of leaving unused our God-given power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The issue of successful resistance is increased firmness of footing.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we are able to ‘withstand in the evil day,’ we shall ‘stand’ more securely when the evil day has stormed itself away. If we keep erect in the shock of battle, we shall stand more secure when the wild charge has been beaten back. The sea hurls tons of water against the slender lighthouse on the rock, and if it stands, the smashing of the waves consolidates it. The reward of firm resistance is increased firmness. As the Red Indians used to believe that the strength of the slain enemies whom they had scalped passed into their arms, so we may have power developed by conflict, and we shall more fully understand, and more passionately believe in, the principles and truths which have served us in past fights. David would not wear Saul’s armour because, as he said, ‘I have not proved it,’ and the Christian who has come victoriously through one struggle should be ready to say, ‘I have proved it’; we have the word of the Lord, which is tried, to trust to, and not we only, but generations, have tested it, and it has stood the tests. Therefore, it is not for us to hesitate as to the worth of our weapons, or to doubt that they are more than sufficient for every conflict which we may be called upon to wage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The text plainly implies that all our life long we shall be in danger of sudden assaults. It does contemplate victory in the evil day, but it also contemplates that after we have withstood, we have still to stand and be ready for another attack to-morrow. Our life here is, and must still be, a continual warfare. Peace is not bought by any victories; ‘There is no discharge in that war.’ Like the ten thousand Greeks who fought their way home through clouds of enemies from the heart of Asia, we are never safe till we come to the mountain-top, where we can cry, ‘The Sea!’ But though all our paths lead us through enemies, we have Jesus, who has conquered them all, with us, and our hearts should not fail so long as we can hear His brave voice encouraging us: ‘In the world ye have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand....">Ephesians 6:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— On this account, because the prize for which you contend is of such great value, and the enemies that oppose you are so subtle, powerful, and malicious, and will assuredly exert themselves to the utmost to effect your destruction, again let me say, <span class="ital">Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand — </span>These dangerous enemies; <span class="ital">in the evil day </span>— The day of temptation and trial. The war, we may observe, is perpetual: but the fight is one day less, and another more violent, and may be longer or shorter, admitting of numberless varieties; <span class="ital">and having done all </span>— Having exerted yourselves to the utmost, and used the grace conferred upon you, and the means and advantages vouchsafed you, according to the will of God, which indeed it will be absolutely necessary for you to do; or, having gone through all your conflicts, and accomplished your warfare; <span class="ital">to stand </span>— Victorious and with joy, before the Son of man. <span class="ital">Stand therefore, having your loins girt — </span>And being in readiness for the encounter as good soldiers of Jesus Christ; <span class="ital">with truth </span>— Not only with the truths of the gospel, but with truth in the inward parts, without which all our knowledge of divine truth will prove but a poor girdle in the evil day. Indeed, as faith is mentioned afterward as a distinct part of the spiritual armour, truth in this place cannot chiefly mean those truths which are the objects of the Christian faith, but rather a true or unfeigned profession of that faith, in opposition to that which is hypocritical, and uprightness of heart in our whole behaviour toward God and man, and a sincere desire to know and do the will of God, in all things. “It has often been observed,” says Doddridge, “that the military girdle was not only an ornament but a defence, as it hid the gaping joints of the armour, and kept them close and steady, as well as fortified the loins of those that wore it, and rendered them more vigorous and fit for action. The chief difficulty here is to know whether truth refers to the true principles of religion, or to integrity in our conduct: and how, on the latter interpretation, to keep it distinct from the breast-plate of righteousness, or, on the former, from the shield of faith. But it seems probable to me, that it may rather signify some virtue of the mind, as all the other parts of the armour enumerated do; and then it must refer to that uprightness and sincerity of intention, which produces righteousness, or a holy and equitable conduct, as its proper fruit.” Thus our Lord is described, <a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>; and as a man girded is always ready for action, and a soldier, who is girded with the military belt, is fitted either for marching or fighting; so this seems intended to intimate an obedient heart, a ready will. Our Lord adds to the <span class="ital">loins girded, </span>the <span class="ital">lights burning, </span><a href="/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>; showing that <span class="ital">watching </span>and <span class="ital">ready obedience </span>are inseparable companions. <span class="ital">And having on the breast-plate of righteousness </span>— Imputed and implanted, justification and sanctification, or pardon and holiness. See on <a href="/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>; <a href="/romans/4-8.htm" title="Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.">Romans 4:8</a>; <a href="/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin....">Romans 6:6-22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>. In the breast is the seat of conscience, which is guarded by righteousness imputed to us in our justification, implanted in us in our regeneration, and practised by us in consequent obedience to the divine will. In the parallel place, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>, this piece of spiritual armour is called <span class="ital">the breast-plate of faith and love; </span>justification being received by faith, and love being the source of all our holiness. Perhaps the apostle, in this passage, alluded to <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a>, where the Messiah is said to have <span class="ital">put on righteousness as a breast-plate; </span>that is, by the holiness of his conduct, and his consciousness thereof, he defended himself from being moved by the calumnies and reproaches of the wicked. No armour for the back is mentioned; we are always to face our enemies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare and suffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the evil day - The day of temptation; the day when you are violently assaulted.<p>And having done all, to stand - Margin, "or overcome."

Comp. Xen. <span class="ital">Anab.</span> i. 10. 1. What is meant by <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντα</span>, is necessarily yielded by the connection, namely, <span class="ital">everything which belongs to the conflict in question</span>, the whole work of the combat in all its parts and actions. The <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεσθαι</span> retains its ordinary signification <span class="ital">peragere, conficere, consummare</span> (comp. van Hengel, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> I. p. 205), and is not, with Oecumenius, Theophylact, Camerarius, Beza, Grotius, Calovius, Kypke, Koppe, Flatt, Holzhausen, Harless, Olshausen, de Wette, Bleek, and others, to be taken in the sense of <span class="ital">debellare, overpower</span>, in which sense it is, like the German <span class="ital">abthun</span> and <span class="ital">niedermachen</span> and the Latin <span class="ital">conficere</span>, usual enough (see Kypke, II. p. 301), but is never so employed by Paul—frequently as the word occurs with him—or elsewhere in the N.T., and here would only be required by the text, if <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντας</span> were the reading.[307] De Wette objects to our interpretation as being tame. This, however, it is not, and the less so, because <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεσθαι</span> is the <span class="ital">characteristic</span> word for a great and difficult work (Herod. v. 24; Plato, <span class="ital">Legg.</span> iii. p. 686 E, <span class="ital">al.</span>; and see Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> I. p. 107), and <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντα</span> also is <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span> (<span class="ital">all without exception</span>; see Valckenaer, <span class="ital">Schol</span>. I. p. 339). To be rejected also is the construction of Erasmus, Beza (who proposes this explanation alongside of the rendering <span class="ital">prostratis</span>, and is inclined to regard it as the better one), Calixtus, Morus, Rosenmüller, and others: “<span class="ital">omnibus rebus probe comparatis ad pugnam</span>” (Bengel). This would be <span class="greekheb">παρασκευασάμενοι</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-8.htm" title="For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?">1 Corinthians 14:8</a>), and what a redundant thought would thus result, especially since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤῆΝΑΙ</span></span></span> would then be not at all different from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤΙΣΤῆΝΑΙ</span></span></span>! Lastly, the translation of the Vulgate, which is best attested critically: <span class="ital">in omnibus perfecti</span> (comp. Lucifer, Ambrosiaster, Pelagius), is not to be regarded, with Estius, as the sense of our reading, but expresses the reading <span class="greekheb">κατειργασμένοι</span>, which is, moreover, to be found in a vitiated form (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΕΡΓΑΣΜΈΝΟΙ</span></span></span>) in codex A. Erasmus conjectured a corruption of the <span class="ital">Latin</span> codices.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[307] Koppe felt this, hence he viewed <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντα</span> as <span class="ital">masculine</span>, in accordance with Kypke’s proposal! Even in those passages which Kypke adduces for <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεσθαι πάντα</span>, instead of <span class="greekheb">κατεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span>, <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> is to be left in the <span class="ital">neuter sense</span>, and <span class="greekheb">κατεργ</span>. is <span class="ital">to complete, to execute</span>. Freely, but correctly in accordance with the sense, Luther renders: “that ye may perform all well, and keep the field.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο ἀναλάβετε τὴν πανοπλίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">wherefore take up the whole armour of God</span>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, because your enemies are such as these. <span class="greekheb">ἀναλαβεῖν</span> is the accepted term for taking up arms, as <span class="greekheb">κατατίθεσθαι</span> is for laying them down (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm" title="Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.

The object of the <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the powers of evil, is left to be understood. The <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα πονηρά</span> is inadequately interpreted as the <span class="ital">day of death</span> (E. Schmid); the <span class="ital">day of judgment</span> (Jer.); the <span class="ital">present life</span> (Chrys., Oec., etc.)—which would rather have been <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν πονηρός</span>; or the whole period of conflict prepared for us by Satan (Rück., Harl., De Wette, Bleek, etc.). Regard must be had to the definiteness given to the <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα</span> by the article, which marks it out as in some sense or other a single day, a critical day, a time of peculiar peril and trial. Hence the choice must be between the <span class="ital">time immediately preceding the Parousia</span>, the searching day of the future in which the powers of evil will make their last and greatest effort (Meyer, etc.), and the <span class="ital">day of violent temptation and assault</span>, whenever that may come to us during the present time (Ell., etc.), “any day of which it may be said, ‘this is your hour, and the power of darkness’ ” (Barry; so also Abb.). The latter view is on the whole to be preferred.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἅπαντα κατεργασάμενοι στῆναι</span>: <span class="ital">and having done all, to stand</span>. In A we have the variant <span class="greekheb">κατεργασμένοι</span>, a misspelling for <span class="greekheb">κατεργασάμενοι</span> or for <span class="greekheb">κατειργασμένοι</span>. The Vulg. renders <span class="ital">in omnibus perfecti</span> (following perhaps the reading <span class="greekheb">κατειργασμένοι</span>). Some make it = “having <span class="ital">prepared</span> all things for the conflict” (Erasm., Beza, etc.); but that would be expressed by some such form as <span class="greekheb">παρασκευασάμενοι</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-8.htm" title="For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?">1 Corinthians 14:8</a>). Others give it the sense of <span class="ital">overpowering</span> (Oec., Chrys., Harl., etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> “overcome” in AV margin)—a sense which it has, but not in the NT, as far as appears, and which will not suit the <span class="ital">neut.</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἅπαντα</span>) here. There is no reason to depart from the ordinary sense of the verb, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that of <span class="ital">perficere</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Plato, <span class="ital">Laws</span>, iii., p. 686 E; Herod., v., 24, etc.), <span class="ital">doing thoroughly, working out</span>, especially (the <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> being intensive) accomplishing a <span class="ital">difficult</span> task. Applied to things evil or dishonourable this becomes <span class="ital">perpetrare</span>. These are the senses which it has in the NT generally and in the Pauline writings in particular (<a href="/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.">Romans 7:15</a>; <a href="/romans/7-17.htm" title="Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>, etc.; and in the sense of <span class="ital">perpetrating</span>, <a href="/romans/1-27.htm" title="And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.">Romans 1:27</a>; <a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1 Peter 4:3</a>). The <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντα</span> refers obviously to the <span class="ital">conflict</span> in view, and means “all things pertaining to your struggle”. The <span class="greekheb">στῆναι</span>, in contrast with the <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστῆναι</span> or <span class="ital">withstanding</span>, denotes the final result; the ability to withstand when the fight is on is to be sought with a view to holding one’s position when the conflict is at an end,—neither dislodged nor felled, but <span class="ital">standing</span> victorious at one’s post.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">take unto</span> you] Lit., <span class="bld">take up</span>, even as Æneas (if the illustration may be reverently offered) took up, and examined, and girt on, the god-wrought panoply brought him by his Mother, on the verge of war (<span class="ital">Æn.</span> viii. 608, &c.).

But the whole passage is concerned with a present and normal “wrestling” against present enemies. Cp. the words ch. <a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm" title="Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.">Ephesians 5:16</a>, “the days <span class="ital">are</span> evil.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having done</span>] More precisely, the verb being compound, “having <span class="ital">wrought out</span>,” “<span class="ital">quite</span> done.” This compound verb is a common one with St Paul, however, and its special etymology must not be greatly pressed (see it, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/romans/7-8.htm" title="But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.">Romans 7:8</a>; <a href="/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid.

Still, an intensity of meaning is in place in this context: “having <span class="bld">accomplished</span> all things, all things demanded for equipment and action.”—The verb bears the meaning “to subdue,” sometimes in the classics, and once or twice in LXX.; but not in other N.T. passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to stand</span>] unmoved at your post, ready for the next assault of the unseen foe. It is important to bear in mind through the whole context that the central idea is fixity, not progress or conquest; ideas of which the Gospel is full, but which are not present <span class="ital">here</span>. The scene is filled with the marshalled hosts of the Evil One, bent upon <span class="ital">dislodging</span> the soul, and the Church, from the one possible vantage-ground of life and power—union and communion with their Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀναλάβετε</span>, <span class="ital">take unto</span> you) <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a> <span class="greekheb">חגר </span><a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm" title="Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.

Paul (says Vict. Strigelius, in summing up the contents of this chapter) gives to the Christian soldier integuments, defences, and offensive weapons. The integuments are three, the breastplate, the girdle, and the shoes; the defences or <span class="greekheb">φυλακτήρια</span> are two, the shield and the helmet; the offensive weapons, <span class="greekheb">ἀμυντήρια</span>,[100] <span class="ital">are also two, the sword and the spear</span>. He had regard, I think, to the order of putting them on, and held the opinion that Paul proceeds from those accoutrements which adorn the man even when outside of the battle-field (as the <span class="ital">breastplate</span> of any material whatever), to those which are peculiar to the soldier; and indeed the phrase <span class="ital">above all</span> is put in between <span class="ital">integuments</span> and <span class="ital">defences</span>. He adds the <span class="ital">spear, prayer</span>.

The command to be "strong in the Lord" is fitly associated with our "having done all," because leaning on almighty strength implies the effort to put forth strength by our own instrumentality; when God's strength comes to us it constrains us "to do all" that can be done by us or through us (comp. <a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). We are not called to do merely as well as our neighbors; nor even to do well on the whole, but to do <span class="accented">all - to</span> leave nothing undone that can contribute to the success of the battle; then we shall be able to stand, or stand firm. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherefore<p>Because the fight is with such powers.<p>Take unto you (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Lit., take up, as one takes up armor to put it on.

Gibbon relates how the relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the soldiers less willing and less able to support the fatigues of the service. They complained of the weight of their armor, and successively obtained permission to lay aside their cuirasses and helmets (ch. 27).<p>Withstand<p>With has the sense of against, as appears in the older English withsay, to contradict; Anglo-Saxon, widstandan, to resist.
