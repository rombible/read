not mainly on its strength or its brightness, as “armour of light” (comp. <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>), but on its completeness, providing against all “the wiles” and “all the fiery darts” of the Evil One, leaving no one point unguarded by a carelessness which may be fatal on all. In this it accords well with the general completeness and harmony of idea so characteristic of this Epistle.<p>To put on the “armour of God”—given us, that is, by God—is declared (by comparison of <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>) to be to “put on the Lord Jesus Christ.” Hence its completeness corresponds to the divine perfection of His true humanity. We are “to grow up unto Him in all things” (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>), to put on His image in all the harmony of “truth” and “righteousness,” of “peace” and “faith,” to receive and use His “salvation” and wield the spiritual energy of His “Word.”<p><span class= "bld">The wiles of the devil.</span>—The word “wiles” (used only here and in <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>) is an almost technical word for the stratagems of a skilful leader. It is notable that these “wiles” are ascribed to the devil, the “prince of the evil spirits” directing his hosts against the army of Christ; the actual “wrestling” of hand-to-hand struggle is with these evil spirits themselves. The word “wrestling” is, of course, not used technically, otherwise the counsel must have been (as in <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>) to divest oneself of all encumbrance. It is the personal grapple with the foe. Still it is possible that there may be some allusion to the “wrestling with the angel” of <a href="/context/genesis/32-24.htm" title="And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.">Genesis 32:24-29</a>, though with a wholly diverse application.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare and suffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put on the whole armor of God - The whole description here is derived from the weapons of an ancient soldier. The various parts of those weapons - constituting the "whole panoply" - are specified in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14-17</a>. The word rendered "whole armor" &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  panoplian, "panoply"), means "complete armor," offensive and defensive; see <a href="/luke/11-22.htm">Luke 11:22</a>; <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> note; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a> note. "The armor of God" is not that which God wears, but that which he has provided for the Christian soldier. The meaning here is:<p>(1) that we are not to provide in our warfare such weapons as people employ in their contests, but such as God provides; that we are to renounce the weapons which are carnal, and put on such as God has directed for the achievement of the victory.<p>(2) we are to put on the "whole armor." We are not to go armed partly with what God has appointed, and partly with such weapons as people use; nor are we to put on "a part" of the armor only, but the "whole" of it. A man needs "all" that armor if he is about to fight the battles of the Lord; and if he lacks "one" of the weapons which God has appointed, defeat may be the consequence.<p>That ye may be able to stand - The foes are so numerous and mighty, that unless clothed with the divine armor, victory will be impossible.<p>Against the wiles of the devil - The word rendered "wiles" (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  methodeia), means properly that which is traced out with "method;" that which is "methodized;" and then that which is well laid - art, skill, cunning. It occurs in the New Testament only in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, and in this place. It is appropriately rendered here as "wiles," meaning cunning devices, arts, attempts to delude and destroy us. The wiles "of the devil" are the various arts and stratagems which he employs to drag souls down to perdition. We can more easily encounter open force than we can cunning; and we need the weapons of Christian armor to meet the attempts to draw us into a snare, as much as to meet open force. The idea here is, that Satan does not carry on an open warfare. He does not meet the Christian soldier face to face. He advances covertly; makes his approaches in darkness; employs cunning rather than power, and seeks rather to delude and betray than to vanquish by mere force. Hence, the necessity of being constantly armed to meet him whenever the attack is made. A man who has to contend with a visible enemy, may feel safe if he only prepares to meet him in the open field. But far different is the case if the enemy is invisible; if he steals upon us slyly and stealthily; if he practices war only by ambushes and by surprises. Such is the foe that we have to contend with - and almost all the Christian struggle is a warfare against stratagems and wiles. Satan does not openly appear. He approaches us not in repulsive forms, but comes to recommend some plausible doctrine, to lay before us some temptation that shall not immediately repel us. He presents the world in an alluring aspect; invites us to pleasures that seem to be harmless, and leads us in indulgence until we have gone so far that we cannot retreat. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the whole armour&#8212;the armor of light (Ro 13:12); on the right hand and left (2Co 6:7).

Believers have once for all overcome him; but on the ground of this fundamental victory gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome him, even as they who once die with Christ have continually to mortify their members upon earth (Ro 6:2-14; Col 3:3, 5).<p>of God&#8212;furnished by God; not our own, else it would not stand (Ps 35:1-3).

The more familiar, however, this figure was to the apostle, the more freely and independently is it here carried out, although (comp. on <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σωτηρίου</span>, <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>) a reminiscence of <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a> (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-17.htm" title="He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.">Wis 5:17</a> ff., and thereon Grimm, <span class="ital">Handb</span>. p. 119 f.) underlies it.[297]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πανοπλίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">τὴν πανοπλ</span>. has the emphasis. In the very fact that not merely single pieces of the armour (Luther: <span class="ital">harness</span>), but the <span class="ital">whole</span> armour of God is put on (“ne quid nobis desit,” Calvin), resides the capacity of resistance to the devil. If <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> had the emphasis (Harless), there must have been a contrast to <span class="ital">other</span> spiritual weapons (for that no material, actual weapons were meant, was self-evident). Rightly, therefore, have most expositors kept by the literal meaning of <span class="greekheb">πανοπλία</span>, <span class="ital">complete suit of armour</span> of the heavy-armed soldier, <span class="greekheb">ὁπλίτης</span> (see Herod, i. 60; Plato, <span class="ital">Legg.</span> vii. p. 796 B; Bos, <span class="ital">Exercitt</span>. p. 192; Ottii <span class="ital">Spicileg</span>. p. 409); and the assertion (recently by Harless) that it here is equivalent generally to <span class="ital">armatura</span> (Vulgate, which was justly censured by Beza), is arbitrary and contrary to linguistic usage; even in <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/14-3.htm" title="Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.">Jdt 14:3</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/3-25.htm" title="For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.">2Ma 3:25</a>, the notion of the <span class="ital">complete</span> equipment is to be adhered to.[298] According to Polybius, vi. 23. 2 ff., there belong to the Roman <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΝΟΠΛΊΑ</span></span></span> shield, sword, greaves, spear, breastplate, helmet. But the circumstance that in the detailed carrying out of the figure, <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a> ff., not <span class="ital">all</span> these parts are mentioned (the <span class="ital">spear</span> is wanting), and withal some portions are brought in (girdle, military sandals) which did not belong exclusively to the equipment of the heavy-armed soldier, but to military equipment in general, can, least of all in the case of Paul, occasion surprise or betray a special set purpose. Whether, we may add, the apostle thought of a <span class="ital">Jewish</span> or a <span class="ital">Roman</span> warrior is, doubtless, substantially in itself a matter of indifference, since the kinds of armour in the two cases were in general the same (see Keil, <span class="ital">Arch</span>. § 158); but the latter supposition is the most natural, inasmuch as the <span class="ital">Roman</span> soldiery wielded the power in all the provinces, Paul himself was surrounded by Roman soldiery, and for most Gentile readers in a non-Jewish province the term <span class="greekheb">πανοπλία</span> could not but call up the thought of the <span class="ital">Roman</span> soldier. Even though Paul had, as we must suppose, the recollection of <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a> when he was employing such figurative language, this did not prevent his transferring the prophetic reminiscence to the conception of a Roman warrior (in opposition to Harless).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] genitivus <span class="ital">auctoris</span>: the <span class="greekheb">πανοπλία</span>, <span class="ital">which comes from God</span>, which God furnishes.

The emphatic thing, as most exegetes notice, is the <span class="greekheb">πανοπλίαν</span>, the idea being that we need not only a Divine equipment, but that equipment in its <span class="ital">completeness</span>, without the lack of any single part. The fact that, in order to meet our spiritual foe, we need to take to ourselves all that God provides for living and for overcoming, is expressed in a telling figure drawn from the world of soldiery.

The general sense of <span class="ital">direction</span> conveyed by the flexible prep. <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> when followed by the acc. takes a wide variety of applications. In this short sentence it expresses <span class="ital">mental</span> direction, <span class="ital">aim</span> or <span class="ital">object</span>, and <span class="ital">local</span> direction, <span class="ital">against</span>. The phrase <span class="greekheb">στῆναι πρός</span> belongs to the soldier’s language, being used for <span class="ital">standing one’s ground</span>, in opposition to taking to flight (Thuc., v., 104, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Raphel., <span class="ital">Annot.</span>, ii., p. 493).

The Rhem. gives <span class="ital">deceits</span>; Tynd., Cov., Cran., Gen., Bish., <span class="ital">assaults</span> or <span class="ital">crafty assaults</span>.

In 1 Thess. and Rom. (just quoted) we have, so to speak, the germs of the developed imagery of this later-written passage. In them, as here, the believer, already (from another point of view, that of covenant and possession) clothed and armed with his Lord, is exhorted so to realize and to use what he has that it shall be like a new clothing and arming.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the whole armour</span>] One word in the Gr., <span class="ital">panoplia</span>.

In the Apocrypha it is not infrequent. Cp. esp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-17.htm" title="He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.">Wis 5:17</a> &c., a very close parallel here as regards the picture:—“He (the Lord) shall take His zeal as a panoply, and make the creature His weapon for the defeat of His enemies; He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and shall make true judgment His helmet; He shall take sanctity as His invincible shield, and shall whet severe wrath as His sword, &c.” These words may very possibly have been in the Apostle’s memory. But far more certainly he had present there <a href="/context/isaiah/59-16.htm" title="And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him....">Isaiah 59:16-17</a>, itself the probable ground of the imagery in Wisdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="ital">panoplia</span> admits no doubt of a looser application in usage; it may mean armour, complete <span class="ital">or not</span>. But its strict meaning, “<span class="ital">whole</span> armour,” is precisely in point here, where the stress of thought is on the <span class="ital">one</span> secret of spiritual strength; the need of Divine safeguard, and nothing less, for the <span class="ital">whole emergency</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cp. again 1 Thessalonians 5 and Romans 13 for parallels, or rather germs, of this passage. There, as here, the image of “putting on” is connected with that of “armour.” And in Rom. distinctly, and in 1 Thess. implicitly, the armour is seen to be reducible ultimately, as here, to the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. St Jerome says here, “From what we read in the passage following, and from the things said in all the Scriptures concerning the Lord (our) Saviour, it most clearly results that by ‘all the arms of God’ … the Saviour is to be understood.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of God</span>] Supplied by Him, having been wrought by Him.

No inadequacy in his equipment is to be feared.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to stand</span>] The key-word of the passage. The present picture is not of a march, or of an assault, but of the holding of the fortress of the soul and of the Church for the heavenly King. Bunyan’s “Mr Standfast” is a portrait that may illustrate this page.—So again below, <a href="/context/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand....">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wiles</span>] Lit, “<span class="ital">methods</span>”; <span class="bld">stratagems</span>.

For the formidable fact of the deliberate and subtle <span class="ital">plans</span> of the great Enemy, carefully concealed but skilfully combined on weak points, cp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1 Peter 2:11</a>, (where render “<span class="ital">carry on a campaign</span> against the soul”). In this respect, as in so many others, the Temptation of the Lord Himself is a picture of that of His followers; a series of veiled attacks, upon points thought weak, by the most subtle of created intellects.—In <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1 Peter 5:8</a> the same Enemy appears acting, as he sometimes does, in another way; by violence and terror.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the devil</span>] See on <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a> for considerations on his personality as recognized by St Paul.
