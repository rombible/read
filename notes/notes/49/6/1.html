In <a href="/context/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>. St. Paul passes from the detailed exposition of the true relation of husbands and wives, to deal with the relation of parents and children, far more cursorily and simply, but under the light of the same idea. It is to be thought of as existing “in the Lord,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>within the unity binding all to Christ, in virtue of which the parental authority and the right freedom of the child are both hallowed.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">In the Lord.</span>—The phrase itself, though familiar in St. Paul’s writings generally, is specially frequent in the Epistles of the Captivity, where it occurs in various connections no less than twenty-one times. (See, for example, <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>.) It is, in fact, a brief indication of their great subject—unity with and in Christ. Here to “obey in the Lord” is to obey under the light and grace of that unity, as already belonging both to parents and children, and transfiguring all natural relations to a diviner glory.<p><span class= "bld">This is right.</span>—Right, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by fundamental laws of humanity, recognised in all races and all ages, declared and sanctioned in God’s commandments (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-2.htm" title="Honor your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;">Ephesians 6:2-3</a>), which are at once both old and new “in the Lord.”<p>(1) In <a href="/context/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>. St. Paul sums up his practical exhortation in that magnificent description which has ever since laid hold of Christian imagination, both in metaphor and in allegory. He paints the Christian life as a battle against spiritual powers of evil, waged in the strength of the Lord, and in the panoply of God. We trace the germ of this great passage first in St. Paul’s earliest Epistle (<a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8-9</a>), and then in the later Epistle to the Romans (<a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>). In both these cases the image is of soldiers starting from sleep at day-break to arm for the fray in the morning light. But it is characteristic of the more elaborate and thoughtful style of this Epistle, and of the circumstances under which it was written (in the watchful presence of the full-armed Roman “soldiers that kept” St. Paul), that the image there briefly touched is here worked out in full beauty of detail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right....">Ephesians 6:1-4</a></span>. The apostle, having explained the duties of wives and husbands, proceeds to the duties of children and parents, and then to those of servants, or slaves rather, and masters, with which he finishes his account of relative duties. <span class="ital">Children, obey your parents </span>— Even your unbelieving parents, in every thing consistent with your duty to <span class="ital">the Lord. </span>In all things lawful, the will of the parent is a law to the child: <span class="ital">for this is right </span>— Manifestly just and reasonable. <span class="ital">Honour </span>— That is, love, reverence, obey, assist in all things; <span class="ital">thy father and mother </span>— The mother is particularly mentioned, as being more liable to be slighted than the father. <span class="ital">Which is the first commandment with promise </span>— For the promise implied in the second commandment does not belong to the keeping that command in particular, but the whole law. Whereas the fifth is the first commandment which hath a promise annexed to it in particular. This observation concerning the promise in the law, to those who honoured their parents, was made by the apostle, to show that the honouring of parents is a matter of the greatest importance to the well-being of society, and highly acceptable to God. <span class="ital">That it may be well with thee </span>— In temporal as well as spiritual things; <span class="ital">and thou mayest live long on the earth </span>— A promise that is usually fulfilled to eminently dutiful children; and he who lives long and well, has a long seed-time for an eternal harvest. But this promise in the Christian dispensation is to be understood chiefly in a more exalted and spiritual sense. <span class="ital">And ye fathers </span>— On the other hand, (whom he names rather than mothers, as being more apt to be stern and severe; mothers, however, are also included;) <span class="ital">provoke not your children to wrath</span> — By any harsh usage, or rigorous treatment of them.

That obedience includes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every age prosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents. The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities. Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements and work upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper and compassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty God requires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of the gospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to the good lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. But those, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich and accomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for the blessing of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Children - &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  tekna This word usually signifies those who are young; but it is used here, evidently, to denote those who were under the care and government of their parents, or those who were not of age.<p>Obey your parents - This is the first great duty which God has enjoined on children. It is, to do what their parents command them to do. The God of nature indicates that this is duty; for he has impressed it on the minds of all in every age; and the Author of revelation confirms it. It is particularly important:<p>(1) Because the good order of a family, and hence of the community, depends on it; no community or family being prosperous where there is not due subordination in the household.<p>(2) because the welfare of the child depends on it; it being of the highest importance that a child should be early taught obedience to "law," as no one can be prosperous or happy who is not thus obedient.<p>(3) because the child is not competent as yet; to "reason" on what is right, or qualified to direct himself; and, while that is the case, he must be subject to the will of some other person.<p>(4) because the parent, by his age and experience, is to be presumed to be qualified to direct and guide a child. The love which God has implanted in the heart of a parent for a child secures, in general, the administration of this domestic government in such a way as not to injure the child. A father will not, unless under strong passion or the excitement of intoxication, abuse his authority. He loves the child too much. He desires his welfare; and the placing of the child under the authority of the parent is about the same thing in regard to the welfare of the child, as it would be to endow the child at once with all the wisdom and experience of the parent himself.<p>(5) it is important, because the family government is designed to be an imitation of the government of God. The government of God is what a perfect family government would be; and to accustom a child to be obedient to a parent, is designed to be one method of leading him to be obedient to God. No child that is disobedient to a parent will be obedient to God; and that child that is most obedient to a father and mother will be most likely to become a Christian, and an heir of heaven. And it may be observed, in general, that no disobedient child is virtuous, prosperous, or happy. Everyone foresees the ruin of such a child; and most of the cases of crime that lead to the penitentiary, or the gallows, commence by disobedience to parents.<p>In the Lord - That is, as far as their commandments agree with those of God, and no further. No parent can have a right to require a child to steal, or lie, or cheat, or assist him in committing murder, or in doing any other wrong thing. No parent has a right to forbid a child to pray, to read the Bible, to worship God, or to make a profession of religion. The duties and rights of children in such cases are similar to those of wives (see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>); and in all cases, God is to be obeyed rather than man. When a parent, however, is opposed to a child; when he expresses an unwillingness that a child should attend a particular church, or make a profession of religion, such opposition should in all cases be a sufficient reason for the child to pause and re-examine the subject. he should pray much, and think much, and inquire much, before, in any case, he acts contrary to the will of a father or mother; and, when he does do it, he should state to them, with great gentleness and kindness, that he believes he ought to love and serve God.<p>For this is right - It is right:<p>(1) because it is so appointed by God as a duty;<p>(2) because children owe a debt of gratitude to their parents for what they have done for them;<p>(3) because it will be for the good of the children themselves, and for the welfare of society. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Eph 6:1-24.

It is the same as that below, <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>, rendered “be obedient.” The child, and the bondservant, are to render an obedience (so the words seem to indicate) different in kind from that of the wife, which is so largely tempered by equality in other respects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Disobedience to parents” (<a href="/romans/1-30.htm" title="Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,">Romans 1:30</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2 Timothy 3:2</a>) appears in Scripture as a symptom of a state of the gravest evil. The example of the Lord stands in sacred contrast to it, for all ages of the Church (<a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>). It is in the school of the well-ordered Christian home that the true idea of the Christian’s position, divinely filial in its freedom, yet (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-21.htm" title="To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>) “<span class="ital">law-abiding</span> unto Christ,” should be first illustrated as well as taught.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">parents</span>] Mothers as well as fathers (see next verse). Scripture uniformly upholds the authority of the mother. Cp. <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm" title="My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm" title="My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 6:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord</span>] I.e., let your <span class="ital">obedience be in Him;</span> rendered as by those whose action gets its reason and secret from union with Him. No doubt the Apostle assumes here a family in which the parents are Christians; but he certainly would not limit the precept to such a case, as it would be limited if “your <span class="ital">parents in the Lord</span>” was the verbal connexion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the case of <span class="ital">Christian</span> parentage, the children, as such, would certainly be reckoned as within the covenant, and, in this sense, “in the Lord.” Cp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a> (“now are the children <span class="ital">holy</span>”). It would be for their own consciences before God, none the less, to ask whether they were also “in Christ” in that inner and ultimate sense which is, spiritually, “new creation” (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is some evidence, but quite inadequate, for the omission of the words “in the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">right</span>] <span class="bld">Just</span>; not merely beautiful, or better, but according to the <span class="bld">Law</span> of God, both in Nature and in Revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle does not deal here with the limits of filial obedience in cases where the Divine Will crosses the parental will. He has the great rule and principle wholly in view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑπακούετε</span>, <span class="ital">obey</span>) This expresses even more than <span class="ital">be subject, be subordinate</span> (ch. <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm" title="Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.">Ephesians 5:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσόμενοι</span>), [comp. <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>.] To <span class="ital">obey</span> is the part of one who is less experienced; to <span class="ital">be subject</span> or <span class="ital">subordinate</span>, of an inferior.—<span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>, <span class="ital">right</span>) even by nature.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</span> The first duty of children is obedience, and "in the Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Christ, this duty is confirmed. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> qualifies, not "parents," but "obey," and indicates that the element or life which even children lead in fellowship with Christ makes such obedience more easy and more graceful. The duty itself rests on the first principles of morality - "for this is right." It is an obligation that rests on the very nature of things, and cannot change with the spirit of the age; it is in no degree modified by what is called the spirit of independence in children. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In the Lord<p>The children being with their parents in the Lord, are to be influenced by religious duty as well as by natural affection.<p>Right (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Belonging essentially to the very nature of the relation. </body></html>
