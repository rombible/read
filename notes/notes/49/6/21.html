It is evident that he well deserved the title of a “faithful minister” to the Apostle; and we note (in <a href="/context/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11-12</a>) that the command to bring Mark, as being “profitable for ministration” is immediately connected with the remark, “Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.”<p><span class= "bld">A faithful minister.</span>—The word “minister” is <span class= "ital">diaconus;</span> but there is no reason to think that it is used technically to describe Tychicus as a deacon.

Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun.

He calls him "a beloved brother": he was a "brother", because he was a partaker of the same grace, was of the same family and household of God, and was of the same function, being a minister of the Gospel, and was a "beloved" one: he was beloved of God and Christ, and of all the saints that knew him, and especially a brother beloved of the Apostle Paul; and where there is brotherhood, there should be love: he also styles him a "faithful minister in the Lord"; he was a "minister" in the work and service of the Lord, in things pertaining to him; he was one of his appointing, qualifying, and sending; and he preached Christ, and him crucified; and was a "faithful" one, to his Lord or master, in whose name he ministered, to the Gospel which he ministered, and to the souls of men to whom he ministered; and a greater character he could not well have; and therefore it need not be doubted but that he would faithfully relate all things concerning the apostle, and what he said might be depended on as truth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> But that ye also may know my affairs, <i>and</i> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</span><p>(15) A familiar and very amiable declaration of his state, together with a solemn prayer, with which Paul is accustomed to end his epistles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] Serving to make the transition to another subject.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>] <span class="ital">ye also</span>, not merely the Colossians, <a href="/context/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;...">Colossians 4:8-9</a>.

In this passage, as in Col., the probable reference is to the activities of Tychicus as St Paul’s helper. Cp. <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a> for the word in a similar connexion. In <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.">1 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.">1 Timothy 4:6</a>; the word is used to denote holders of a subordinate office in the Christian ministry. And cp. <a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>, where it is used of a Christian <span class="ital">woman</span> holding a recognized position in the work of the Church. Here, however, such a meaning is unlikely, the person being of a calibre, and in a connexion with the Apostle, which do not suggest an inferior grade of work. In no passages of the N.T. save Rom., Phil., and 1 Tim., quoted above, has the word <span class="ital">diaconos</span> any necessary connexion at all with organized ministry as such. E.g. in <a href="/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a>; <a href="/john/2-9.htm" title="When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,">John 2:9</a>, it denotes a “servant” in the commonest sense; in <a href="/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil.">Romans 13:4</a>, a “servant” of God in civil magistracy; in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, a “servant” of the New Covenant, as an active agent in its promulgation. In <a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.">Galatians 2:17</a>; it is used of the Lord Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord</span>] The last occurrence in the Epistle of this sacred and pregnant phrase.
