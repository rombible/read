and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a>, in the first verse, shows) is a psalm celebrating some moving of the ark, traditionally (and most probably) connected with David’s bringing up of the ark (2 Samuel 6) to Mount Zion. The very change from the second person to the third person shows it to be a free quotation; and this is made far more evident by the remarkable variation from the text of the original, which runs, <span class= "ital">Thou receivedst gifts in man</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>probably, “among men;” and adds, “even the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them”—a clause which (from <a href="/context/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29-31</a>) we may suppose to refer to the homage of the heathen to the Lord Jehovah. Now, it has been noted that the word “received” is used constantly for “receiving,” or “fetching,” for another (<a href="/genesis/15-9.htm" title="And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.">Genesis 15:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al</span>.); and it appears that the Chaldee Targum actually has here, as a gloss: “Thou hast given gifts to the sons of men,” interpreting the words, curiously enough, of Moses as a mediator between God and man. The psalm also was recognised as a Messianic psalm, foreshadowing the dwelling of “God with us” in the universal kingdom of the true Mediator. St. Paul accordingly uses it with a bold variation suiting his context. The key to this use is found in the truth enunciated of our Lord in <a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>, that “being by the right hand of God exalted, and <span class= "ital">having received</span> of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, <span class= "ital">He hath shed forth this.”</span> Our Lord, as the Head of humanity, receives only in order to give. From the means, therefore, the Apostle passes to the end.<p><span class= "bld">He led captivity captive.</span>—The modern use of these words as describing our Lord’s triumph over the power of evil, hitherto triumphant over man, and so giving freedom by leading captive the power of captivity, although in itself profoundly true, is not supported by the original, in which it is simply used for “a body of captives.” St. Paul’s use of it here is probably best interpreted by <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, where it is said of the “principalities and powers”—the powers of sin and death—that “He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.” (See Note on this passage.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore he saith - The word "he" is not in the original; and it may mean "the Scripture saith," or "God saith." The "point" of the argument here is, that Christ, when he ascended to heaven, obtained certain "gifts" for people, and that those gifts are bestowed upon his people in accordance with this. To "prove" that, he adduces this passage from <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>. Much perplexity has been felt in regard to the "principle" on which Paul quotes this Psalm, and applies it to the ascension of the Redeemer. The Psalm seems to have been composed on the occasion of removing the ark of the covenant from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion; <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a> ff it is a song of triumph, celebrating the victories of Yahweh, and particularly the victories which had been achieved when the ark was at the head of the army. It "appears" to have no relation to the Messiah; nor would it probably occur to anyone upon reading it, that it referred to his ascension, unless it had been so quoted by the apostle.<p>Great difficulty has been felt, therefore, in determining on what principle Paul applied it to the ascension of the Redeemer. Some have supposed that the Psalm had a primary reference to the Messiah; some that it referred to him in only a secondary sense; some that it is applied to him by way of "accommodation;" and some that he merely uses the words as adapted to express his idea, as a man adopts words which are familiar to him, and which will express his thoughts, though not meaning to say that the words had any such reference originally. Storr supposes that the words were used by the Ephesian Christians in their "hymns," and that Paul quoted them as containing a sentiment which was admitted among them. This is "possible;" but it is mere conjecture. It has been also supposed that the tabernacle was a type of Christ; and that the whole Psalm, therefore, having original reference to the tabernacle, might be applied to Christ as the antitype.<p>But this is both conjectural and fanciful. On the various modes adopted to account for the difficulty, the reader may consult Rosenmuller in loc. To me it seems plain that the Psalm had original reference to the bringing up the ark to Mount Zion, and is a triumphal song. In the song or Psalm, the poet shows why God was to be praised - on account of his greatness and his benignity to people; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-6</a>. He then recounts the doings of God in former times - particularly his conducting his people through the wilderness, and the fact that his enemies were discomfited before him; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7-12</a>. All this refers to the God, the symbols of whose presence were on the tabernacle, and accompanying the ark. He then speaks of the various fortunes that had befallen the ark of the covenant. It had lain among the pots, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>, yet it had formerly been white as snow when God scattered kings by it; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>.<p>He then speaks of the hill of God - the Mount Zion to which the ark was about to be removed, and says that it is an "high hill" - "high as the hills of Bashan," the hill where God desired to dwell forever; <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>. God is then introduced as ascending that hill, encompassed with thousands of angels, as in Mount Sinai; and the poet says that, in doing it, he had triumphed over his enemies, and had led captivity captive; <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>. The fact that the ark of God thus ascended the hill of Zion, the place of rest; that it was to remain there as its permanent abode, no more to be carried about at the head of armies; was the proof of its triumph. It had made everything captive. It had subdued every foe; and its ascent there would be the means of obtaining invaluable gifts for people; Mercy and truth would go forth from that mountain; and the true religion would spread abroad, even to the rebellious, as the results of the triumph of God, whose symbol was over the tabernacle and the ark.<p>The placing the ark there was the proof of permanent victory, and would he connected with most important benefits to people. The "ascending on high," therefore, in the Psalm, refers, as it seems to me, to the ascent of the symbol of the Divine Presence accompanying the ark on Mount Zion, or to the placing it "on high" above all its foes. The remainder of the Psalm corresponds with this view. This ascent of the ark on Mount Zion; this evidence of its triumph over all the foes of God; this permanent residence of the ark there; and this fact, that its being established there would be followed with the bestowment of invaluable gifts to people, might be regarded as a beautiful emblem of the ascension of the Redeemer to heaven. There were strong points of resemblance. He also ascended on high. His ascent was the proof of victory over his foes. He went there for a permanent abode. And his ascension was connected with the bestowmerit of important blessings to people.<p>It is as such emblematic language, I suppose, that the apostle makes the quotation. It did not originally refer to this; but the events were so similar in many points, that the one would suggest the other, and the same language would describe both. It was language familiar to the apostle; language that would aptly express his thoughts, and language that was not improbably applied to the ascension of the Redeemer by Christians at that time. The phrase, therefore, "he saith " - &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  legei - or "it saith," or "the Scripture saith," means, "it is said;" or, "this language will properly express the fact under consideration, to wit, that there is grace given to each one of us, or that the means are furnished by the Redeemer for us to lead holy lives."<p>(For remarks on the subject of accommodation. in connection with quotations from the Old Testament into the New Testament, see the supplementary notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>, note. The principle of accommodation, if admitted at all, should be used with great caution. Doubtless it is sanctioned by great names both in Europe and America. Yet it must be allowed, that the apostles understood the mind of the Spirit, in the Old Testament, that their inspiration preserved them from every error. When, therefore, they tell us that certain passages have an ultimate reference to the Messiah and his times, through we should never have discovered such reference without their aid, nothing of the kind, it may be, "appearing" in the original places, yet we ate bound to receive it "on their testimony." It is alleged, indeed, that the apostles sometimes use the ordinary forms of quotation, without intending to intimate thereby any prophetic reference in the passages titus introduced, nay, when such reference is obviously inadmissible. This, in the opinion of many, is a very hazardous statement, and introduces into the apostolic writings, and especially into the argumentative part of them, where so great use is made of the Old Testament, no small measure of uncertainty. Let the reader examine the passages in question, keeping in view. at the same time, the typical nature of the ancient economy, and he will have little difficulty in admitting the prophetic reference in most, if not in all of them. See Haldane on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, for a very masterly view of this subject, with remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>, and other passages supposed to demand the accommodation theory.<p>"Nothing can be more dishonorable," says that prince of English commentators, on the Epistle to the Romans, "to the character of divine revelation, and injurious to the edification of believers, than this method of explaining the quotations in the New Testament from the Old, not as predictions or interpretations, but as mere illustrations, by way of accommodation. In this way, many of the prophecies referred to in the Epistles are set aside from their proper application, and Christians are taught that they do not prove what the apostles adduced them to establish." In reference to the quotation in this place, there seems little difficulty in connection with the view, that though the primary reference be to the bringing up of the ark to Mount Zion, the ultimate one is to the glorious ascension of Jesus into the highest heavens. The Jews rightly interpret part of this psalm Ps. 68 of the Messiah. Nor is it to he believed that the apostle would have applied it to the ascension of Christ unless that application had been admitted by the Jews in his time, and unless himself were persuaded of its propriety.<p>When he ascended up on high - To heaven. The Psalm is, "Thou hast ascended on high;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>.<p>He led captivity captive - The meaning of this in the Psalm is, that he triumphed over his foes. The margin is, "a multitude of captives." But this, I think, is not quite the idea. It is language derived from a conqueror, who not only makes captives, but who makes captives of those who were then prisoners, and who conducts them as a part of his triumphal procession. He not only subdues his enemy, but he leads his captives in triumph. The allusion is to the public triumphs of conquerors, especially as celebrated among the Romans, in which captives were led in chains (Tacitus, Ann. xii. 38), and to the custom in such triumphs of distributing presents among the soldiers; compare also <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, where it appears that this was also an early custom in other nations. Burder, in Res. Alt u. neu Morgenland, in loc. When Christ ascended to heaven, he triumphed ever all his foes. It was a complete victory over the malice of the great enemy of God, and over those who had sought his life. But he did more. He rescued those who were the captives of Satan, and led them in triumph. Man was held by Satan as a prisoner. His chains were around him. Christ rescued the captive prisoner, and designed to make him a part of his triumphal procession into heaven, that thus the victory might be complete - triumphing not only over the great foe himself, but swelling his procession with the attending hosts of those who "had been" the captives of Satan, now rescued and redeemed.<p>And gave gifts unto men - Such as he specifies in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Wherefore&#8212;"For which reason," namely, in order to intimate that Christ, the Head of the Church, is the author of all these different gifts, and that giving of them is an act of His "grace" [Estius].<p>he saith&#8212;God, whose word the Scripture is (Ps 68:18).<p>When he ascended&#8212;God is meant in the Psalm, represented by the ark, which was being brought up to Zion in triumph by David, after that "the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies" (2Sa 6:1-7:1; 1Ch 15:1-29). Paul quotes it of Christ ascending to heaven, who is therefore God.<p>captivity&#8212;that is, a band of captives. In the Psalm, the captive foes of David. In the antitypical meaning, the foes of Christ the Son of David, the devil, death, the curse, and sin (Col 2:15; 2Pe 2:4), led as it were in triumphal procession as a sign of the destruction of the foe.<p>gave gifts unto men&#8212;in the Psalm, "received gifts for men," Hebrew, "among men," that is, "thou hast received gifts" to distribute among men. As a conqueror distributes in token of his triumph the spoils of foes as gifts among his people. The impartation of the gifts and graces of the Spirit depended on Christ's ascension (Joh 7:39; 14:12). Paul stops short in the middle of the verse, and does not quote "that the Lord God might dwell among them." This, it is true, is partly fulfilled in Christians being an "habitation of God through the Spirit" (Eph 2:22). But the Psalm (Ps 68:16) refers to "the Lord dwelling in Zion for ever"; the ascension amidst attendant angels, having as its counterpart the second advent amidst "thousands of angels" (Ps 68:17), accompanied by the restoration of Israel (Ps 68:22), the destruction of God's enemies and the resurrection (Ps 68:20, 21, 23), the conversion of the kingdoms of the world to the Lord at Jerusalem (Ps 68:29-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherefore he saith; </span> the psalmist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When he; </span> Christ, God manifested in the flesh: and then what was spoken by the psalmist prophetically in the second person, is spoken by the apostle historically in the third. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ascended up on high; </span> Christ ascended up on high after his death, both as to place, in his human nature, into heaven; and chiefly as to his state, in his being glorified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He led captivity captive; </span> either led those captive who had taken us captive, or rather led them captive whom he had taken captive; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">captivity</span> being here put for captives, as elsewhere poverty for poor, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2 Kings 24:14</a></span>.

The manner of citation with the simple <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, obviously meant of God, has as its necessary presupposition, in the mind of the writer and readers, the Theopneustia of the O. T. The <span class="ital">citation</span> that follows is not “<span class="ital">ex carmine</span>, quod ab Ephesiis cantitari sciret,” and in which <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a> had partly furnished the words (Storr, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. III. p. 309; Flatt),—which is quite an arbitrary way of avoiding the difficulty, and at variance with the divine <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>,—but is the passage of Scripture <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a> itself according to the LXX. <span class="ital">with free alteration</span>. This psalm, in its historical sense a <span class="ital">song of triumph</span> upon the solemn entry of God into Zion,[204] is here understood according to its <span class="ital">Messianic</span> significance—an understanding, which has its warrant, not indeed in the much too general and vague proposition, that one and the same God is the Revealer of the Old and of the New Covenant (Harless), but in the circumstance that the triumphal procession of Jehovah, celebrated in the psalm, represents the <span class="ital">victory of the Theocracy</span>; and that, as every victory of the Theocracy is of a typical and in so far prophetic Messianic character, the return of Christ into heaven appears as the Messianic actual consummation of the divine triumph. The <span class="ital">free deviation</span> from the original text <span class="ital">and the LXX</span>. consists partly in the immaterial circumstance that Paul transfers into the third person that which is said in the second, and adds to <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώποις</span> the article wanting in the LXX.; partly in the essential point, that instead of the original sense: “Thou <span class="ital">receivedst</span> gifts (namely, gifts of homage) among[205] men” (<span class="greekheb">לָקַחְתָּ מַתָּנוֹת בָּאָדָם</span>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβες δόματα ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ</span>, or according to another reading: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνθρώποις</span>), he expresses the sense: <span class="ital">He gave</span> gifts <span class="ital">to men</span>, <span class="greekheb">נָתַן מַתָּנוֹת לַאֲנָשִׁים</span>, while in other respects reproducing the transition of the LXX. Consequently Paul has, as regards the <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>, given a sense <span class="ital">opposite</span> to the original one—a degree of variation such as, with all freedom in the employment of Old Testament passages, is nowhere else met with in the writings of the apostle, on which account the book <span class="ital">Chissuk Emuna</span> accused him of falsifying the words of the psalm, while Whiston looked upon the Hebrew text and the LXX. in <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a> as corrupt. This difference is not to be <span class="ital">explained</span>, with Rückert, by lightly asserting: “Paul did not even perhaps know exactly how the words ran,” etc.; for in this way he would be chargeable with a shallow caprice, for which there is no warrant; moreover, the agreement, in other respects, of the citation with the original text and the LXX. leads us to infer too exact an acquaintance with the passage adduced, to allow us to assume that Paul adduced the words in the full belief that <span class="greekheb">נתן</span> was read in the Hebrew, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΔΩΚΕ</span></span></span> in the LXX. Rather must he have in reality <span class="ital">understood</span> the passage of the psalm, as to its main substance, just as he gives it. Inasmuch, namely, as he had recognised the words in their bearing upon the antitypical Messianic fulfilment, and that as a confirmation of what had been said of Christ in <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>, this latter special application must either have been suggested to him by another <span class="ital">reading</span>, which he followed (<span class="greekheb">נתת</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">לקחת</span>), or else—with the freedom of a Messianic interpretation of the words—by an <span class="ital">exposition</span> of the Hebrew words, which yielded essentially the sense expressed by him. If the <span class="ital">latter</span> is the case (for in favour of the former there is no trace of critical support), he took <span class="greekheb">לקחת</span>, etc., in the sense: <span class="ital">thou didst take away gifts, to distribute them among men</span> (on the <span class="greekheb">בְּ</span>, see Ewald, Ausführl. Lehrb. der Heb. Spr. § 217 f. 1), and translated this <span class="ital">in an explanatory way</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε δόματα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span>; in connection with which the transposing into the third person is to be regarded as an unintentional variation in citing from memory. <span class="greekheb">לקח</span>, namely, has often the proleptic sense <span class="ital">to fetch</span> [Germ. holen], <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to take anything for a person and to give it to him. See <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-16.htm" title="Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.">Genesis 42:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-9.htm" title="And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.">Genesis 48:9</a>; <a href="/job/38-20.htm" title="That you should take it to the bound thereof, and that you should know the paths to the house thereof?">Job 38:20</a> (and Hirzel <span class="ital">in loc.</span>); <a href="/2_samuel/4-6.htm" title="And they came thither into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.">2 Samuel 4:6</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>; see Gesen. <span class="ital">Thes</span>. II. p. 760, and Hoelemann, p. 97 f. Comp. Bengel: “<span class="ital">accepit</span> dona, quae statim <span class="ital">daret.</span>” The utterance, however, as thus understood,[206] Paul has reproduced, <span class="ital">interpreting</span> it as he has done, in order to place beyond doubt the sense which he attached to it, for the reader who might have otherwise understood the words of the LXX. The Chaldee Paraphrast likewise understood <span class="greekheb">לקח</span> in such wise, that, while interpreting the passage of <span class="ital">Moses</span>, he could expound: <span class="greekheb">לְהוֹן מַתְנָן לִבְנֵי נָשָּׁא</span>, <span class="ital">dedisti dona filiis hominum</span>. It is evident from this, since there is good reason for presupposing in the Targum—the more so, as in our passage the Peshito agrees therewith (which likewise, Psalms 68 <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, has <span class="ital">dedisti dona filiis hominum</span>)—older exegetical traditions, that Paul himself may have followed such a tradition (Holzhausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Credner, Beiträge, II. p. 121 f.). To assume that he actually did so, is in itself, and in reference to the previous Rabbinical training of the apostle, free from objection, and has sufficient warrant in that old and peculiar agreement, even though we should explain the agreement between the same citation in Justin, <span class="ital">c. Tryph.</span> 39, 87, and the quotation of the apostle, by a dependence upon the latter (Credner, <span class="ital">Beitr.</span> II. p. 120). On the other hand, it is not to be said, with Beza, Calovius, and most older expositors,[207] that the explanation given by Paul <span class="ital">really corresponds</span> with the historic sense of the passage in the Psalm (see especially, Geier, <span class="ital">ad Ps. l.c.</span> p. 1181; comp. also Hoelemann, p. 98 f.), which, judging by the context, is decidedly incorrect3. Even Calvin says: “nonnihil a genuino sensu hoc testimonium detorsit Paulus;” and already Theodore of Mopsuestia aptly remarks: <span class="greekheb">ὑπαλλάξας δὲ τὸ ἔλαβε δόματα οὕτως ἐν τῷ ψαλμῷ κείμενον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε δόματα εἶπε</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῇ ὑπαλλαγῇ περὶ τὴν οἰκείαν χρησάμενος ἀκολουθίαν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ</span> (in the psalm) <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν ὑπόθεσιν τὸ ἔλαβεν ἥρμοττεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐνταῦθα δὲ</span> (in our passage) <span class="greekheb">τῷ προκειμένῳ τὸ ἔδωκεν ἀκόλουθον ἦν</span>. The deviation from the historic sense cannot be set aside with fairness and without arbitrary presuppositions. This holds not only of the opinions of Jerome and Erasmus (that in the psalm <span class="greekheb">לקח</span> is used, because the <span class="ital">giving</span> has not yet taken place, but is promised as future) and of Calvin (“quum de Christi exaltatione pauca verba Psalmi citasset, <span class="ital">de suo adjecit</span>, eum dedisse dona, ut sit minoris et majoris comparatio, qua ostendere vult Paulus, quanto praestantior sit ista Dei ascensio in Christi persona, quam fuerit in veteribus ecclesiae triumphis”), but also of the expedients to which Harless and Olshausen have recourse. According to Harless, namely, Paul wishes to express <span class="ital">the identity of God</span>, whose deeds at that time the word of Scripture represents in a <span class="ital">form</span> which, as identical with the <span class="ital">form</span> of Christ’s action, makes us recognise the word of the O. T. as pointing forward. to what was to come, and the Christ of the N.T. as the God who already revealed Himself under the O. T.; in the words of the psalm the captives themselves are described as <span class="ital">sacrificial gifts</span>, which the victor as God takes to Himself among men; the apostle changes merely the <span class="ital">form</span> of the words, so far as the context makes it necessary, inasmuch as he wishes to make out that those vanquished ones—who have not made themselves what they are, but have been made so of God—are <span class="ital">those</span>, of whom he had said that on every one according to the measure of the gift of Christ the grace had been bestowed which was already pointed to in the psalm. “There is no other there,” says the apostle, “than He who had descended to earth, to gain for Himself His own; not that they would have presented themselves to Him, but He takes them as it pleases Him, and makes them what it pleases Him.” But (1) Paul does not wish to express <span class="ital">the identity of God</span>, etc., but to show that what is said <span class="ital">of Christ</span> in <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a> was also already prophesied <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>; it was a question of the identity of the <span class="ital">thing</span>, as to which it was self-evident that the triumph celebrated in Psalms 68 is in the N.T. fulfilment celebrated by <span class="ital">Christ</span>, who had come in the name of the Lord. (2) In the Ps. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, <span class="greekheb">לקחת מתנות</span> applies to the <span class="ital">gifts of homage</span> which the triumphing Jehovah has received among (from) men. Certainly, according to another explanation (see above, Ewald’s view, and comp. also Bleek), the men themselves, namely, the vanquished, may be regarded as the gifts or offerings which God has received; but who could withal read between the lines in the apostle’s citation what, according to Harless, one ought to read between them, in order in the end to find only the <span class="ital">form</span> of the words changed? Olshausen, who, we may mention, quite erroneously (see <a href="/context/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?...">Ephesians 4:9-10</a>) specifies <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῖς ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΙς</span></span></span> as the point of the citation,[208] agrees with Harless in so far as he is of opinion that the thought of the psalmist: “Thou hast taken to Thyself gifts among men,” affirms nothing else than: “Thou hast chosen to Thyself the redeemed as offerings;” but further adds: “But the man whom God chooses as an offering for Himself, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as an instrument for His aims, He furnishes with the gifts necessary to the attainment of the same; and this side (?) the apostle, in accordance with his tendency, here brings into special prominence.” Similarly also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 484 f., who is of opinion that here, in the N.T. application of the passage from the psalm, it is one and the same thing whether one say: that Christ has, for the accomplishment of the work of His honour, caused to be given to Himself by His vanquished that which they possessed, or: that He has given them gifts to this end; “for He takes that which is theirs into His service, when He gives to them what is His, to make them capable of service.” Essentially so also Delitzsch on the Psalm, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> Such subtleties, by means of which any <span class="ital">quid pro quo</span> at pleasure may easily enough be got out of the alleged light and significance of the “history of the fulfilment” (Delitzsch), may be conveniently foisted upon the words of the apostle, but with what right?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΒᾺς ΕἸς ὝΨΟς</span></span></span>] Whether we understand the <span class="greekheb">עָלִיתָ לַמָּרוֹם</span> in the original text of the ascending of the victorious God into <span class="ital">heaven</span> (Hengstenberg, Lengerke, Hitzig, Harless, Hoelemann, and others) or to Zion (Ewald, Bleek), or leave it without more precise definition of place (Hofmann); according to the Messianic accomplishment of the divine triumphal procession, which takes place through Christ, the words apply to <span class="ital">Christ ascended</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΨΩΘΕΊς</span></span></span>, <a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>) <span class="ital">to heaven</span> (<a href="/psalms/102-20.htm" title="To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;">Psalm 102:20</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/13-8.htm" title="Beware that thou be not deceived and brought down in thy jollity.">Sir 13:8</a>; <a href="/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>), who <span class="ital">has brought in as captives</span> enemies that have been vanquished by Him upon this triumphal march.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλωσία</span>, namely, is the abstract collective for <span class="greekheb">αἰχμάλωτοι</span> (<a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/2-9.htm" title="And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth.">Jdt 2:9</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-5.htm" title="And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.">Ezra 6:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm" title="He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.

Hence also it cannot be <span class="ital">the souls delivered by Christ from Hades</span> (Lyra, Estius, and many Catholic expositors; König, von Christi Hbllenfahrt, p. 26; Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 414; and Baur) that are spoken of. It is the <span class="ital">enemies of Christ</span> and His kingdom, the <span class="ital">antichristian powers</span>, including those of hell (but not these alone); their power is broken by the completed redeeming work of the Lord. By His resurrection and exaltation they have been rendered powerless, and subjected to His victorious might; consequently they appear, in accordance with the poetical mould of our passage, as those whom He has vanquished and carries with Him on His procession from Hades into heaven (see <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>), so that He, <span class="ital">having gone up on high, brings them in as prisoners of war</span>. Not as if He has <span class="ital">really</span> brought them in captivity to heaven, but under the <span class="ital">figure of the triumphator</span>, as which the ascended Christ appears in accordance with the prophetic view given in Psalms 68, the matter thus presents itself, namely, the overcoming of His foes displaying itself through His ascension. This vanquishing, we may add, in its actual execution still continues even after the entering upon the kingly office which took place with the exaltation of Christ; <span class="greekheb">δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν βασιλεύειν ἄχρις οὗ θῇ πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>. Not the <span class="ital">final</span> overcoming of the foes of Christ is thus meant, but the <span class="ital">actual</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλωτεύειν αἰχμαλ</span>. ofttimes recurs until the final consummation, until at length <span class="greekheb">ἔσχατος ἐχθρὸς καταργεῖται ὁ θάνατος</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, namely, at the resurrection on the last day. In this case, however, there is the more reason for leaving the matter without more precise definition of the hostile powers vanquished (Satanic and human), as the context suggests nothing more special, and as, speaking generally, the <span class="greekheb">ᾐχμαλώτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλ</span>. does not form for the aim and connection of <span class="ital">our passage</span> the essential point of the psalmist’s saying, but the latter would have been quite as fully in its place here, even though that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ᾘΧΜΑΛΏΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑἸΧΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> had not been inserted, since the element confirmatory of <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a> lies simply in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΒᾺς ΕἸς ὝΨΟς ἜΔΩΚΕ ΔΌΜΑΤΑ ΤΟῖς ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΙς</span></span></span>.[209] Yet we have not, with Morus (comp. flatt), to rationalize the conception of the apostle: “removit omnia, quae religionis suae propagationi et felicitati hominum obstarent impedimenta,” by which the sense is altered, and vanquished foes become obstacles taken out of the way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δόματα</span>] according to Paul, gifts in which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΌΘΗ Ἡ ΧΆΡΙς</span></span></span> 7, thus equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΡΊΣΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span>.

But to look upon the interpretation of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΛΑΒΕ ΔΌΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> of the Ps. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, in the sense of gifts of the Spirit as current among the <span class="ital">disciples of the apostles</span> (de Wette), is the more arbitrary, inasmuch as de Wette himself finds it probable that some <span class="ital">apostle</span> has allegorized the passage of the psalm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[204] On what particular historic occasion this highly poetic song was composed, is for our passage a matter of indifference. According to the <span class="ital">traditional</span> view, it was composed by David on the occasion of the removal of the ark of the covenant from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2 Samuel 6:12</a> ff.; 1 Chronicles 15 f.); according to Ewald, for the consecration of the new temple after the captivity; according to Hupfeld, upon the return from the captivity and the restoration of the kingdom; according to Hitzig, in celebration of the victory after the war of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat against the Moabites (2 Kings 3). Others explain it otherwise. See the different views and explanations in Keuss, <span class="ital">d. acht u. sechzigste Psalm, tin Denkmal exeget. Noth u. Kunst</span>, 1851, who, however, himself very inappropriately (without “exegetical exigency and art”) places the Psalm in the late period between Alexander and the Maccabees, when the wish for the reunion of the scattered Israelites in Palestine is supposed to be expressed in it; while Justus Olshausen even interprets it of the victories of the Maccabees under Jonathan or Simon. See Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> IV. p. 55 f. Certainly the psalm is neither Davidic nor of the Maccabaean age, but belongs to the restoration of the Theocracy after the captivity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[205] Yet באדם might also denote that men themselves are the gifts. So Ewald takes it, l.c. (and comp. his Ausführl. Lehrb. der Hebr. Sprache, § 287 h), referring it specially to the humbler servants of the temple, whom David and Solomon, e.g., gathered from among the subjugated peoples and settled around the temple, whom thus God, as if in a triumphal procession from Sinai to Zion, Himself brought in as captives, and then caused to be devoted by men to Him as offerings, in order that they, who were once so turbulent, might dwell peacefully in His service (“even rebellious ones must dwell with Jah God,” as Ewald renders the closing words of the passage). The sense: “through men,” which Hoelemann, on account of ver. 11, finds as a “secondary” meaning in באדם, is not to be thought of, not even according to the apostle, who has expressed his view with such simple definiteness by <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[206] The phrase formerly so often compared, לָקַח אִשָׁה לִבְנוֹ (<a href="/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm" title="And you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.">Exodus 34:16</a>), is not in place here, since לָקַח, in that phrase, signifies nothing else than the simple take.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[207] Chrysostom, without, however, entering into any particulars, says merely: the prophet says <span class="ital">thou hast received</span>, but Paul: <span class="ital">he has given</span>; and the two are one and the same. Theodoret more precisely explains himself: <span class="greekheb">ἀμφότερα δὲ</span> (the taking and giving) <span class="greekheb">γεγένηναι</span>· <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνων γὰρ τὴν πίστιν ἀποδίδωσι τὴν χάριν</span>. Comp. Oecumenius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[208] “Paul does not wish by the quotation primarily to represent Christ as the dispenser of the gifts, but to prove from the O. T. itself <span class="ital">the universality of the gifts of Christ</span>, consequently the equal title of the Gentiles; He has by His redemption conferred gifts not merely on this one or that one, not upon the Jews alone, but <span class="ital">upon men as such, upon mankind</span>.” What Olshausen has further advanced respecting the dative expression with the article (instead of which the Hebrew text has <span class="ital">among men</span>, while no article is used in the LXX.)—to wit, that by <span class="greekheb">ἔδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόμ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span>, which applies to <span class="ital">all</span> men, it is not intended to say: all men <span class="ital">must</span> be redeemed, and as redeemed receive gifts; but: all men <span class="ital">may</span> be redeemed, and as redeemed obtain gifts of grace; and in so far this deviation from the original was altogether immaterial—is pure invention. The difference certainly does not lie in the fact that בָּאָדָם points only to some, and the expression of Paul to all men, as Olshausen supposes, but solely in the לקחת of the original text and the <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span> of Paul. As well באדם as <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span> designates men according to the category; but according to the original text it is men who are the givers, so that the Triumphator takes them; whereas, according to Paul, the men are the recipients, to whom He gives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[209] Chrysostom, Theophylact, Beza, Calovius, and many others understood specially the devil and those things connected with him, death, condemnation, and sin. Comp. Luther’s gloss: “that is sin, death, and conscience, that they may not seize or keep us.” Grotius rationalizes: “<span class="ital">per apostolorum doctrinam</span> vicit et velut captivam egit <span class="ital">idololatriam et vitia alia</span>.” Most comprehensively, but with an admixture of heterogeneous elements, Calvin says: “Neque enim Satanam modo et peecatum et mortem totosque inferos prostravit, sed ex rebellibus quotidie facit sibi obsequentem populum, quum verbo suo carnis nostrae lasciviam domat; rursus hostes suos, i.e. impios omnes quasi ferreis catenis continet constrictos, dum illorum furorem cohibet sua virtute, ne plus valeant, quam illis concedit.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὸ λέγει</span>: <span class="ital">wherefore He saith, when He ascended on high</span>. The <span class="greekheb">διό</span> introduces the words which follow as a <span class="ital">confirmation</span> of what has just been said; and these words are not a parenthesis, but part of a direct and continuous statement; = “the fact that it is thus with Christ and His gift, and that the grace which we possess is bestowed by Him on each of us in varying measures as He distributes it, has the witness of God Himself in OT Scripture”. The quotation which follows is obviously taken from <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>, and in the main in the form in which it is given in the LXX. There are difficulties in the rendering which Paul uses and in the application he makes of it. But they are not such as to justify the assertion that the passage is a quotation from some Christian hymn, and not from Scripture. There is nothing in the verse or in the context to suggest anything else than the Psalm. The question is raised whether the introductory <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> is personal or impersonal; and whether, if personal, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span>, or <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is to be understood. OT quotations are usually introduced by the personal term in such forms as <span class="greekheb">ὁ προφήτης λέγει</span> (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφὴ λέγει</span> (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a>), <span class="greekheb">Ἡσαΐας λέγει</span> (<a href="/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

Some, therefore, hold that, in cases like the present, <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> is impersonal, = “it is said,” as <span class="greekheb">φησί</span> is used impersonally in Attic (Abb.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Light, on <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>). As the NT, however, makes a very limited use of impersonal verbs of any kind, most take these undefined verbs by which quotations are introduced as personal, and so it is with <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> here. The subject to be supplied must be the one most readily suggested by the context; and here, as in most cases, that will be neither <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span> nor <span class="greekheb">τὸ Πνεῦμα</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>. The full formula <span class="greekheb">λέγει ὁ Θεός</span> occurs in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>, and is implied in the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν</span>, “<span class="greekheb">Σήμερον</span>,” <span class="greekheb">ἐν Δαυεὶδ λέγων</span> of <a href="/hebrews/4-7.htm" title="Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.">Hebrews 4:7</a>. It is also confirmed in some degree by the analogous mention of the <span class="ital">Holy Ghost</span> in <a href="/hebrews/10-15.htm" title="Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,">Hebrews 10:15</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 656; Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 75).—<span class="greekheb">Ἀναβὰς εἰς ὕψος</span>: <span class="ital">when He ascended on high</span>. In the Psalm the victorious Subject is addressed in the second person; here the “Thou” becomes “He”. In the Psalm the ascent expressed by <span class="greekheb">עָלִיתָ לַמָּרו̇ם</span> (= “Thou hast gone up to the height”) is the triumphant ascent of the God of Israel to <span class="ital">Zion</span>, the place of His earthly rest, or (better) to heaven His proper habitation, after the victory He achieved for His people. Here it is the ascension of Christ to the right hand of God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>). The aor. part. has its most proper temporal force, denoting something that preceded the main event in view. It means here, therefore, that Christ’s ascension had taken place <span class="ital">before</span> He distributed the gifts of grace.—<span class="greekheb">ᾐχμάλωτευσεν αἰχμαλωσίαν</span>: <span class="ital">He led captivity captive</span>. In the original <span class="greekheb">שָׁבִיתָ שֶׁבִי</span>, the abstract <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλωσίαν</span> (= “a body of captives”) chosen according to a familiar usage (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/numbers/31-12.htm" title="And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.">Numbers 31:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which you have taken captive of your brothers: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is on you.">2 Chronicles 28:11</a>; see Win.-Moult., p. 282), instead of the concrete <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλώτους</span> (“captives”), adds to the force of the sentence. The verb <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλωτεύω</span> belongs to late Greek; it is pretty freely used in the LXX and the Apocrypha. The phrase is a general one, meaning nothing more than that He <span class="ital">made captives</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/judges/5-12.htm" title="Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.">Jdg 5:12</a>), and suggesting nothing as to who these captives were. Neither in the Psalm nor in Paul’s use of it here is there anything to warrant the idea that the captives are the <span class="ital">redeemed</span> (Theod.), or <span class="ital">men in the bonds of sin on earth</span> (Harl.), or <span class="ital">souls detained in Hades</span> (Est., König, Delit., etc.). The most that the words themselves, or passages more or less analogous (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet....">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</a>) warrant us to say is that the <span class="ital">captives</span> are the <span class="ital">enemies</span> of Christ; just as in the Psalm they are the enemies of Israel and Israel’s God. But these are left quite undefined, and the whole idea of the clause is subordinate to that next expressed, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the giving of the gifts.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔδωκε δόματα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span>: <span class="ital">and gave gifts unto men</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> of the TR is found in [377] [378] [379]3[380]3 [381] [382], etc.; but is omitted in [383] [384] [385] [386]2[387]*[388], 17, etc. It is put in brackets by WH, and omitted by LT, but retained (on the whole rightly) by RV. Here the quotation diverges widely, both from the original Hebrew, which has <span class="greekheb">בָּאָדָם לָקַחְתָּ מַתָּכוֹת</span> (= “Thou hast received gifts among men”); and from the LXX which renders it <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβες δόματα ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώποις</span>). The idea in the Psalm is that of Jehovah, the Conqueror, <span class="ital">receiving</span> gifts, that is to say, <span class="ital">gifts of homage</span>; or, possibly, receiving the captured men themselves regarded as gifts or offerings, the <span class="greekheb">בָּאָדָם</span> being capable of that sense (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Ewald, <span class="ital">Aus. Lehrb. d. Hebr. Sprache</span>, § 287 <span class="ital">h</span>). The idea expressed here is that of the ascended Christ <span class="ital">giving</span> gifts to men; <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span> being substituted for <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβες</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span> for the generic <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀνθρώποις</span>).—Thus in order to suit the purpose of a testimony to the statement made regarding Christ and the gift of grace, the OT passage is materially changed. OT quotations introduced in the NT are given without much regard to the literal faithfulness with which quotations are expected to be made in modern times; and in other passages made use of by Paul (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)...">Romans 10:6-10</a>) we discover a remarkable liberty both in reproduction and in application. But in none is the change so great as in the present case. There is first the departure from the historical meaning of the Psalm; in which, however, this passage stands by no means alone. The Psalm in which this magnificent description of the victorious march of Israel’s God occurs, celebrates the establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom in the past and proclaims the certainty of its triumph over all enemies and in all nations in the future. It does this in connection with some great event in the history of Israel. All possible opinions have been expressed as to the particular occasion of the Psalm. It has been identified with the removal of the Ark to Zion in David’s time (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2 Samuel 6:12</a>, etc.; 1 Chronicles 15); with some unnamed victory of David or with David’s victories generally; with the placing of the Ark in Solomon’s Temple; with the victory of Jehoshaphat and Jehoram over Moab (2 Kings 3; Hitzig); with the check given to the Assyrians in Hezekiah’s time; with the consecration of the Temple of the Restoration (Ewald); with the return from the captivity (Hupfeld); with the struggle between Egypt and Syria for the possession of the Holy Land towards the close of the third century B.C.; with the victories of Jonathan or Simon in the Maccabean wars (Olsh.); with the struggle between Ptolemy Philometor and Alexander Balas (1 Maccabees 14), etc. But all this uncertainty as to the particular date and occasion does not affect the fact that what is dealt with is some great passage in the history of the Jewish nation. The probabilities are that the Psalm belongs to the latter part of the Babylonian exile; but Paul passes by the actual historical intention of the words and puts on them a quite different sense. There is, <span class="ital">secondly</span>, the notable change from Jehovah <span class="ital">receiving</span> gifts to Christ <span class="ital">giving</span> gifts. Some have explained this by supposing that Paul followed a Hebrew text which read <span class="greekheb">נתת</span>, or some such form, instead of <span class="greekheb">לקחת</span>; but of this there is no evidence. It is possible, indeed, that the Apostle adopted a <span class="ital">traditional</span> version or interpretation of the passage which was familiar, and of which some indication is found in the Peshitta Syriac and the Chaldee Paraphrase (both having a rendering = “Thou didst give gifts to the children of men”). Something also may be said in support of the explanation that the <span class="greekheb">לָקַח</span> of the original, which is used elsewhere in the sense of <span class="ital">fetching</span> or taking <span class="ital">in order to give</span> (<a href="/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-16.htm" title="Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.">Genesis 42:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-9.htm" title="And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.">Genesis 48:9</a>, etc.), has that meaning here. But after all such explanations the fact remains that both the terms and the idea are changed. There is <span class="ital">thirdly</span> the Messianic interpretation. It is here that the justification of the change is found. The Psalm, there is good reason to believe, had been regarded as a Messianic Psalm; and the use made of it by Paul was in all probability in accordance with views of Messianic prophecy which had become current, and with a method of dealing with the OT which was generally understood. But in any case it is an <span class="ital">application</span> rather than an <span class="ital">interpretation</span> in the strict sense of the word that we have here. And the justification of such an application lies in the fact that the unknown event celebrated in the Psalm was a victory of the Theocratic King, and in that sense a part of that triumph of the Kingdom of God which was to be carried to its consummation by the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[377] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[378] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[379] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[380] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[381] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[382] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[383] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[384] Autograph of the original scribe of א.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[385] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

The Heb. there is lit., “Thou didst ascend on high; Thou didst lead captive a captivity (a band of captives); Thou didst take gifts amongst men,” or more lit., “in man.” The LXX. renders, “When Thou didst ascend on high, Thou didst lead captive a captivity; Thou didst take gifts in man.” The Targum, or Chaldee paraphrase, which is little likely to have been influenced by this passage, renders, “Thou hast <span class="ital">given</span> to them gifts, even to the sons of men.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On this quotation, we first examine the discrepancy between “<span class="ital">take</span> gifts” and “<span class="ital">give</span> gifts,” and between “<span class="ital">among</span> men” and “<span class="ital">for</span>” or “<span class="ital">to</span> men,” and then briefly remark on the use made of the Psalmist’s words by the Apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">α</span>. The first discrepancy is not to be reconciled by an attempt to make the Heb. verb mean both “give” and “take.” But what if the “taking” was for the purpose of “giving”? The Conqueror, Divine or human, in Psalms 68 may well be conceived as <span class="ital">receiving</span> grants for <span class="ital">distribution</span> among his vassals. If so, the Targum (see above) and the Apostle rightly convey the intention of the Psalmist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“<span class="ital">Among</span> men”; “<span class="ital">for</span> men.” The great compression of Hebrew poetical diction makes it quite possible to explain, “<span class="ital">so as to be</span> among men.” Thus again “to,” or “for,” will rightly convey the intention of the Psalmist, whatever were his precise and conscious thought in depicting the Conqueror as making gifts and grants to “<span class="ital">man</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">β</span>. The “first reference” of Psalms 68 is a large and difficult question. See Dean Perowne’s full statement of problems and theories in his Commentary on the Psalms; see too Dr Kay’s notes. It is enough here to say that the Psalm celebrates, apparently, some great sacred triumph, or triumphs, at the Sanctuary of Zion; an occasion on which the supreme Conqueror, Jehovah, is represented as “ascending” after battle to His throne. One type of criticism will see in this nothing beyond a national Ode of Victory, and will regard the Apostle’s quotation as an “unscientific” accommodation. For ourselves, believing that our Lord taught a very different view of the Ancient Scriptures, we feel free to recognize any “first reference” fairly provable, but also bound to believe that the Divine Author worked through the human author, so as to convey eternal and permanent truth through his imagery and words, and so as to make the whole terminate on Christ, whether or no the human author was aware of it. And we believe that the same Divine Author worked here through the memory and thought of the Apostle, so as to secure, in his quotation and exposition, the true development of the Divine intention of the earlier passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>We thus accept the present verse as reciting a true testimony of the Spirit of Prophecy to the foreseen facts of the Ascension of the Divine Messiah after conflict and conquest, and the distribution of blessings consequent upon it. The “captivity” will denote whatever persons or powers are in any way His conquest; whether as “enemies under His feet” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>, &c.), or self-surrendered rebels reconciled to His will (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:...">2 Corinthians 10:3-5</a>, &c.).—For the thought, “He <span class="ital">received</span> gifts (to <span class="ital">distribute</span>) amongst men,” cp. <a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λεγει</span>, <span class="ital">he says</span>) David, nay, rather God Himself, Psalms 68 :(19) 20, <span class="greekheb">ἀνέβης εἰς ὓψος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἠχμαλώτευσας αἰχμαλωσίαν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβες δόματα ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ</span>.

That psalm is a psalm of triumph, where the placing of the ark on Zion is celebrated as if it had been a great victory. As this quotation shows, the psalm in its deepest sense is Messianic, celebrating the victory of Christ. The substance rather than the words of the passage are given, for the second person ("thou hast ascended," etc.) is changed into the third; and whereas in the psalm it is said, "gave gifts <span class="accented">to</span> men," as modified by the apostle it is said, "received gifts for men." As in a literal triumph, the chiefs of the enemy's army are led captive, so the powers of darkness were led captive by Christ (captivity, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, denotes <span class="accented">prisoners</span>); and as on occasion of a triumph the spoils of the enemy are made over to the conqueror, who again gives them away among the soldiers and people, so gifts were given to Christ after his triumph to be given by him to his Church. We must not force the analogy too far: the point is simply this - as a conqueror at a triumph gets gifts to distribute, so Christ, on his resurrection and ascension, got the Holy Spirit to bestow on his Church (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherefore<p>Confirming by Scripture what has just been said.<p>When He ascended, etc.<p>Quoted from <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a> (Sept. 67:18). The Hebrew reads: "Ascending to the height thou didst lead captive captivity, and received gifts in man." So Sept. Paul changes thou didst lead, didst receive, into he lead and he gave. The Psalm is Messianic, a hymn of victory in which God is praised for victory and deliverance. It is freely adapted by Paul, who regards its substance rather than its letter, and uses it as an expression of the divine triumph as fulfilled in Christ's victory over death and sin.<p>Ascended<p>The ascent of Jehovah is realized in Christ's ascent into heaven.<p>Captivity<p>Abstract for the body of captives. See on <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>. The captives are not the redeemed, but the enemies of Christ's kingdom, Satan, Sin, and Death.

Thus Paul interprets the received of the Old Testament. His point is the distribution of grace by Christ in varied measure to individuals. He confirms this by Scripture, seeing in the Jehovah of this Old-Testament passage the Christ of the New Testament - one Redeemer under both covenants - and applying the Psalmist's address to Christ who distributes the results of His victory among His loyal subjects. These results are enumerated in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a> sqq. </body></html>
