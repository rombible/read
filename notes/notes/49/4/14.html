The word “doctrine,” as usual, is a general word for all deliberate “teaching,” whether acting on the understanding or the heart. It includes, in fact, all influence consciously exercised to a definite end.<p>The metaphor is then dropped, and the evil influences to which childish instability is a prey are described—first, as the “sleight,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the sleight of hand of the dice-thrower, describing quick, sudden deceit of detail; next (to substitute an accurate translation for the unusually paraphrastic rendering of our version), as a “craftiness devoted to the systematic plan of deceit,” thus referring to deeper and subtler forms of delusion. This reference is so definite in the original, that we are tempted to believe St. Paul to have had in view some particular scheme of erroneous teaching, which had already struck root in the soil of Asia Minor. The Epistle to the Colossians shows that such false teaching had appeared itself at Colossæ; it was, perhaps, the germ of the more full-grown Gnosticism noted in the Pastoral Epistles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">That we henceforth be no more children </span>— Mere babes in Christian knowledge, experience, and practice; weak and unstable; <span class="ital">tossed</span> — <span class="greekheb">Κλυδωνιζομενοι</span>, <span class="ital">fluctuating </span>from within, through various restless lusts and passions working in our hearts, even when there is nothing external to agitate or excite them; <span class="ital">and carried about with every wind of doctrine </span>— And temptation from without, when we are assaulted by others who are themselves unstable as the wind; <span class="ital">by the sleight, </span>or subtlety, <span class="ital">of men</span> — Greek, <span class="greekheb">εν τη κυβεια των ανθρωπων</span>, which words Chandler proposes rendering, <span class="ital">by the dicing of men; </span>the expression referring to the artifice of those infamous gamesters, who know how to cog the dice. So that the deceitful arts of false teachers and others, who endeavour to draw men from the belief and practice of the truth as it is in Jesus, by their insinuations and wiles, are here compared to the tricks of gamesters, who, by using false dice, and by various arts, cheat those with whom they play. <span class="ital">And cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εν πανουργια προς την μεθοδειαν της πλανης</span>, a clause which Beza renders, “veteratoria ad insidiose fallendum versutia,” <span class="ital">by the tricking of those long exercised in craftily deceiving others; </span>Doddridge’s translation is, <span class="ital">by their subtlety in every method of deceit; </span>and Macknight’s, <span class="ital">by craftiness formed into a subtle scheme of deceit. </span>The former noun, <span class="greekheb">πανουργια</span>, signifies the doing of things by trick and sleight of hand, and the latter, <span class="greekheb">μεθοδεια</span>, (which, <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a>, is applied to the wiles and subtle contrivances of the devil, in order to deceive and ruin men,) properly signifies a regular plan of proceeding in any affair, and is here used for a regular plan of deceit, formed either for upholding people in their ignorance of, and opposition to the gospel, or for drawing them from their faith in, or obedience to, some article of it. “The men,” Macknight thinks, “whose base arts the apostle describes in this passage, were the unbelieving Jews and the heathen philosophers, who opposed the gospel by sophistry and calumny; also such false teachers as arose in the church itself, and corrupted the doctrines of the gospel for worldly purposes, while at the same time they assumed the appearance of great disinterestedness and piety.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That we henceforth be no more children - In some respects Christians "are" to be like children. They are to be docile, gentle, mild, and free from ambition, pride, and haughtiness; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2-3</a>. But children have other characteristics besides simplicity and docility. They are often changeable <a href="/matthew/11-17.htm">Matthew 11:17</a>; they are credulous, and are influenced easily by others, and led astray, In these respects, Paul exhorts the Ephesians to be no longer children but urges them to put on the characteristics Of manhood; and especially to put on the firmness in religious opinion which became maturity of life.<p>Tossed to and fro - &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  kludo&#772;nizomenoi. This word is taken from waves or billows that are constantly tossed about - in all ages art image of instability of character and purpose.<p>And carried about with every wind of doctrine - With no firmness; no settled course; no helm. The idea is that of a vessel on the restless ocean, that is tossed about with every varying wind, and that has no settled line of sailing. So many persons are in regard to religious doctrines. They have no fixed views and principles. They hold no doctrines that are settled in their minds by careful and patient examination, and the consequence is, that they yield to every new opinion, and submit to the guidance of every new teacher. The "doctrine" taught here is, that we should have settled religious opinions. We should carefully examine what is truth, and having found it, should adhere to it, and not yield on the coming of every new teacher. We should not, indeed, close our minds against conviction. We should be open to argument, and be willing to follow "the truth" wherever it will lead us. But this state of mind is not inconsistent with having settled opinions, and with being firm in holding them until we are convinced that we are wrong. No man can be useful who has not settled principles. No one who has not such principles can inspire confidence or be happy, and the first aim of every young convert should be to acquire settled views of the truth, and to become firmly grounded in the doctrines of the gospel.<p>By the sleight of men - The cunning skill "trickery" of people. The word used here - &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  kubeia - is from a word (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kubos) meaning a cube or die, and properly means a game at dice. Hence, it means game, gambling; and then anything that turns out by mere chance or hap-hazard - as a game at dice does. It "may" possibly also denote the trick or fraud that is sometimes used in such games; but it seems rather to denote a man's forming his religious opinions by "the throw of a die;" or, in other words, it describes a man whose opinions seem to be the result of mere chance. Anything like casting a die, or like opening the Bible at random to determine a point of duty or doctrine, may come under the description of the apostle here, and would all be opposed to the true mode, that by calm examination of the Bible, and by prayer A man who forms his religious principles by chance, can un" form" them in the same way; and he who has determined his faith by one cast of the die, will be likely to throw them into another form by another. The phrase "the sleight of men" therefore I would render "by the mere chance of people, or as you may happen to find people, one holding this opinion, and the next that, and allowing yourself to be influenced by them without any settled principles."<p>Cunning craftiness - Deceit, trick, art; see <a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="/luke/20-23.htm">Luke 20:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>; notes, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, note.<p>Whereby they lie in wait to deceive - Literally, "Unto the method of deceit;" that is, in the usual way of deceit. Doddridge, "In every method of deceit." This is the true idea. The meaning is, that people would use plausible pretences, and would, if possible, deceive the professed friends of Christ. Against such we should be on our guard; and not by their arts should our opinion be formed, but by the word of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Meaning not children of men, for grace does not destroy natural relations; nor children of God, which is a privilege, and always continues; nor indeed children of disobedience, though the saints cease to be such upon conversion; but in such sense children, as they were when first converted, newborn babes, little children: there are some things in which they should be children still, namely, with respect to an ardent and flaming love to God and Christ, and to the saints; and with regard to their eager desire after the sincere milk of the word; and as to pride, malice, envy, evil speakings, guile and hypocrisy; in these things it becomes them to be children: but not in understanding; they should not always remain ignorant, imprudent, or be always fed with milk, and not able to digest meat; nor be unable to go unless led, and be tender and incapable of bearing hardships for Christ and his Gospel, and of defending it, and his cause and interest; but should play the man, and quit themselves as such and be strong, which the Gospel ministry is a means of, and encourages to: <p>tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine; false doctrine, which may be compared to wind for its lightness and emptiness, and for its swelling and puffing nature, and for the noise and bluster it makes, and for its rapidity and force, with which it sometimes comes and bears all before it, and for its infectiousness, which is the nature of some winds; and to be tossed to and fro, and carried about with it, is expressive of much ignorance and want of a discerning spirit, and implies hesitation, and doubts and scruples, and shows credulity, fickleness, and inconstancy: and which is brought on <p>by the sleight of men; either through the uncertain and changeable state of things in life; the mind of man is fickle, the life of man is uncertain, and all the affairs of human nature are subject to change, by reason of which men are easily imposed upon; or rather through the tricking arts of false teachers; the word here used is adopted by the Jews into their language, and with them signifies the game at dice (a); and  is a gamester at that play, and is interpreted by them, one that steals souls (b), and deceives and corrupts them; and may be filly applied to false teachers, who make use of such like artifices and juggling tricks, to deceive the hearts of the simple, as the others do to cheat men of their money: hence it follows, <p>and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; or "unto the deceitful methods or wiles of the devil", as the Alexandrian copy reads; which not only suggests that their principal end in view is to deceive, but their insidious, private, and secret way of deceiving, and their expertness in it, which they have from the devil; and now the ministration of the Gospel is the best and surest guard and antidote against such fluctuations and deceptions. <p>(a) T.

That purpose looks to a <span class="ital">change</span> which has to take place in us from the condition of <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span> and <span class="greekheb">κλυδωνιζόμενοι</span> to that of <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐξάνοντες</span>, etc. The <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι</span> implies something different from the existing condition, and that existing condition, we see, is one of immaturity, assailed, wavering faith, and subjection to the distracting influence of false teachers. In his address to the elders at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>) Paul had spoken of “grievous wolves” that would enter the Ephesian Church after his departure.

Here AV, RV, Ell., etc., take the second sense. “In the fact that now this, now that, is taught according to varying tendencies, there blows, now this, now that, <span class="ital">wind of doctrine</span>” (Mey.).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ κυβείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>: <span class="ital">in the sleight of men</span>.

The prep. may be the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> (so Mey., Haupt, etc.). But the contrast with the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>) points rather to the usual force of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as = <span class="ital">in</span> (so Vulg., Copt., etc.), the <span class="greekheb">κυβεία</span> being the “<span class="ital">element</span>, the evil <span class="ital">atmosphere</span>, as it were, <span class="ital">in</span> which the varying currents of doctrine exist and exert their force” (Ell.). <span class="greekheb">κυβεία</span> means <span class="ital">dice-playing</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Plato, <span class="ital">Phaedr.</span>, p. 274 D), and then <span class="ital">deception, fraud</span>. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Beza, Von Soden, etc.) give it the sense of <span class="ital">levity</span>, or <span class="ital">putting at stake</span>—a shade of meaning occasionally expressed by the verb <span class="greekheb">κυβεύειν</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Plato, <span class="ital">Prot.</span>, p. 314 A). The idea expressed here by the <span class="greekheb">κυβεία</span> itself might be simply that of <span class="ital">hazard, unsettlement</span>, with reference to the <span class="ital">uncertainties</span> into which the <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span> were cast by the diverse forms of false teaching under which they fell (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Haupt). But it is in the character, not of <span class="ital">gamesters</span>, but <span class="ital">deceivers</span> that the false teachers are immediately presented (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Mey.). This “sleight of men” is in contrast with “the faith and the knowledge <span class="ital">of Christ</span>,” or it may be with the pure, sure word of God by which the faith and knowledge of the Son of God came.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πανουργίᾳ πρὸς τὴν μεθοδείαν τῆς πλάνης</span>: <span class="ital">in craftiness with a view to the machination of error</span>. The renderings of the great Versions show how difficult it is to do justice to this sentence in English. The AV takes refuge in a paraphrase, “and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive”. Wicl. gives “to the deceiving of error”; Cov., “to the deceitfulness of error”; Bish., “in craftiness to the laying in wait of error”; Rhem., “to the circumvention of error”; RV, “in craftiness, after the wiles of error”. The Vulg. has <span class="ital">in astutia ad circumventionem erroris</span>. <span class="greekheb">πανουργία</span>, used in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" title="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, of a <span class="ital">false wisdom</span>, means here, as in classical and also in later Greek, <span class="ital">cunning, knavishness, treacherous deceitfulness</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν πανουργίᾳ</span> is taken by some as a definition of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν κυβείᾳ</span>, adding to the idea of <span class="ital">hazard</span> and <span class="ital">destruction</span> contained in the latter, the idea of <span class="ital">fraud</span>. But it is rather a distinct clause, emphasising the dishonesty and trickery of the false teaching. Its authors used all the arts of deception to persuade the <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span> that their self-made doctrine was the Divine truth. The prep. <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> is not to be identified with <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> (= <span class="ital">after, according to</span>), but has its sense of <span class="ital">with a view to, furthering, tending to</span>. The noun <span class="greekheb">μεθοδεία</span> (or <span class="greekheb">μεθοδία</span> according to TWH) is nowhere found in the NT except here and once again in this same Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a>), and seems not to occur in non-Biblical Greek, whether that of the LXX or that of the Classics. Its meaning here, however, may be safely taken to be <span class="ital">trickery, cunning arts, treacherous wiles</span>; as its verb <span class="greekheb">μεθοδεύω</span>, which means primarily to <span class="ital">pursue a plan</span>, whether <span class="ital">honest</span> (Diod. Sic., i., 81), or <span class="ital">dishonest</span> (Polyb., xxxiv., 4, 10), came to have the sense of <span class="ital">following craftily</span>, practising <span class="ital">deceitful devices</span> (Diod., vii., 16; <a href="/2_samuel/19-27.htm" title="And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.">2 Samuel 19:27</a>). The gen. <span class="greekheb">πλάνης</span> is usually taken as the <span class="ital">gen. subj.</span>, = the <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> which practises craft. But it may rather be the <span class="ital">gen. obj.</span>, expressing the <span class="ital">object</span> or <span class="ital">result</span> of the <span class="greekheb">μεθοδεία</span>, = “the cunning art that works to error”. The article gives the noun the abstract sense or the force of a personification, = Error. Here, as elsewhere, <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> has the passive sense of <span class="ital">error</span>, not the active sense of <span class="ital">seduction</span>, or <span class="ital">misleading</span> (Luth., de Wette, etc.). But the question remains as to the precise idea here. The term means properly speaking <span class="ital">error</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">straying from the way, wandering hither and thither</span>. That sense is frequent in classical Greek—Aeschyl., Eurip., Plato, etc. In the NT the word is usually said to be used of <span class="ital">mental</span> error, wrong opinion, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm" title="You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.">2 Peter 3:17</a>; <a href="/judges/1-11.htm" title="And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:">Judges 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a>. But it is doubtful whether that sense fully meets the case in some of the passages thus cited, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a>. In such passages as <a href="/romans/1-27.htm" title="And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.">Romans 1:27</a>; <a href="/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a>, it denotes error in practice, a wrong way of life or action. This seems to be its force here. Consequently the idea of the clause is more definite than “in craftiness tending to the settled system of error” (Ell.). It means “in craftiness, furthering the scheming, deceitful art which has for its result the false way of life that strays fatally from truth.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">that we</span> henceforth, &c.] This verse takes up the thought of <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>.
