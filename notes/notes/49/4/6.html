The Church is essentially Catholic, inheriting by special gift what is the birthright of all humanity; incapable of perfection till all be drawn into that closer sonship, yet having neither right nor desire to deny that outside her pale at any moment the wider Fatherhood of God extends.<p><span class= "bld">Who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</span>—The word “you” has little authority; many MSS. and commentaries have “us.” But the best MSS. and authorities omit both, as probably early glosses of explanation which have crept into the text. Accordingly, the word “all” throughout must be taken, as above, as applying to all God’s rational creatures, made in His image (and indeed, in a lower sense, even to all His creatures), but especially and properly to the members of Christ’s Church. In the three-fold sentence many ancient and modern interpreters trace a reference to the Holy Trinity. But, strictly speaking, this cannot be, as the passage expressly points to the Father; although, in virtue of the eternal unity of the Godhead, it may be true that in the expression “through all” and “in all” we trace those manifestations of the Father which are especially made through the Son and by the Holy Spirit. Hence we must refer all properly to the ultimate conception of God the Father; as “above all” in the sovereignty of His will, since to work out “His pleasure they are and were created,” and His will becomes to them the “law eternal;” as “through all” in the diffusive power of the forces—physical, moral, and spiritual—by which the world of nature, still more the world of man, most of all the society of Christians, are swayed as wholes; and “in all” by the indwelling of God in the individual for creation, sustentation, regeneration, which is the breath of life—both the physical and spiritual life. (This individuality, and the especial reference to Christians, are marked by the very natural gloss “us,” or “you,” in this clause.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One God - The same God; therefore there should be unity. Were there many gods to be worshipped, there could be no more hope of unity than there is among the worshippers of Mammon and Bacchus, and the various other idols that people set up. People who have different pursuits, and different objects of supreme affection, can be expected to have no union. People who worship many gods, cannot hope to be united. Their affections are directed to different objects, and there is no harmony or sympathy of feeling. But where there is one supreme object of attachment there may be expected to be unity. The children of a family that are devoted to a parent, will be united among themselves; and the fact that all Christians have the same great object of worship, should constitute a strong bond of union among themselves - a chain always kept bright.<p>And Father of all - One God who is the Father of all; that is, who is a common Father to all who believe. That this refers to the Father, in contradistinction from the Son and the Holy Spirit, seems evident. The Spirit and the Son are mentioned in the previous verses. But the fact that the "Father of all" is mentioned as "God," does not prove that the Spirit and the Son are not also endowed with divine attributes. That question is to be determined by the attributes ascribed to the Son and the Holy Spirit in other places. All sincere Christians worship "one" God, and "but" one. But they suppose that this one God subsists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, united in a mysterious manner, and constituting the one God, and that there is no other God. That the Father is divine, they all hold, as Paul affirms here; that the Son and the Holy Spirit are also divine, they also hold; see the <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a> note; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> note; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a> note. The meaning here is, that God is the common Father of "all" his people - of the rich and the poor; the bond and the free; the learned and the unlearned. He is no respecter of persons. Nothing would tend more to overcome the prejudices of color, rank, and wealth, than to feel that we all have one Father; and that we are all equally the objects of his favor; compare notes on <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>.<p>Who is above all - Who is supreme; who presides over all things.<p>And through all - He pervades universal nature, and his agency is seen everywhere.<p>And in you all - There is no one in whose heart he does not dwell.

Many of the oldest versions and Fathers and old manuscripts read, "in us all."

See also <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>, and comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-6.htm" title="And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all.">1 Corinthians 12:6</a>. The distinction from the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span> lies not in <span class="ital">the thing itself</span>, since both elements denote the immanent ruling of God by virtue of His Spirit, but in the <span class="ital">form of conception</span>, since with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> the relation is conceived of as operative <span class="ital">indwelling</span>, and with <span class="greekheb">διά</span> as operative <span class="ital">movement</span> throughout all Christian hearts (“Deus enim Spiritu sanctificationis diffusus est per omnia ecclesiae membra,” Calvin). According to Harless, the thought expressed in <span class="greekheb">διὰ πάντων</span> is, that God <span class="ital">as head works through the members</span>. But of the conception of the head and the members there is absolutely nothing in the context; further, though mention is made of God as <span class="ital">Father</span>, it is not the Father, but <span class="ital">Christ</span>, that is Head of the members; lastly, in place of the simple <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span>, which is to be mentally supplied, there would be insensibly introduced a wholly different supplement, namely, <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργῶν</span>, or a similar verb.[202] At the bottom of this explanation there lies, indeed, the presupposition, that the relation of the <span class="ital">Trinity</span> is expressed in the three prepositions, as Jerome, Thomas, and many of the older expositors would have it. Against this altogether arbitrary supposition, however, Theophylact already rightly declared himself. See also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 201. Olshausen, too, finds here, as at <a href="/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.">Romans 11:36</a>, the Trinity; holding that God is described in His various relations to the creature [rather to the <span class="ital">Christians</span>] as Lord <span class="ital">over</span> all things, as instrument <span class="ital">by</span> which they are (this being held to apply to the Son), and as the element <span class="ital">in</span> which they are. Thus, moreover, the prepositional relation of the last two clauses is exactly <span class="ital">reversed</span>, inasmuch as not <span class="greekheb">διὰ πάντων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is explained, but <span class="greekheb">διʼ οὗ πάντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.! According to Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol. d. N.T.</span> p. 250, there is expressed, at least in the form of hint, the threefold <span class="ital">mode of existence of God</span> (“self-preservation, self-disclosure, self-communication”). But apart from the fact that such a threefold <span class="ital">form of existence</span> is not the expression of the New Testament triad, the self-communication, in fact, is implied not only in <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span>, but necessarily already in <span class="greekheb">διὰ πάντων</span>. Lastly, Koppe is wrong in an opposite way: “Sententia videtur <span class="ital">una</span>, tantum variis <span class="ital">formulis</span> synonymis (!) expressa haec: <span class="ital">cui vos omnes debetis omnia</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, further, that the great fundamental elements of unity, <a href="/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;...">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, are <span class="ital">matters of fact</span>, historically <span class="ital">given</span> with Christianity itself, and as such are not affected by differences of <span class="ital">doctrine</span>; hence without reason there have been found here traces of the later age, when “upon the basis of the Pauline thought a Catholic church was built,” of which the centralization in doctrine and constitution was not derived from the adherents of Paul, but was a Petrine thought (Schwegler). The <span class="ital">Catholic</span> idea in our passage is just the Pauline one (1 Corinthians 12), cherished by Christ Himself (<a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] This also in opposition to Winzer: “qui per omnes operatur, quasi unoquoque utitur ad declarandam suam majestatem, ad consilia sua exsequenda.” So, in the main, de Wette (comp.
