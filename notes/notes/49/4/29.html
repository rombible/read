Perhaps, as before, the word “good” may be taken for <span class= "ital">gracious</span> and full of sympathy, noting by the quick insight of love what each man’s need is, and hastening to speak accordingly, so as to “give grace” or blessing to meet that peculiar need. The same use of the word “grace” is found in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15</a> (“that ye might have a second benefit”).

The corrupt word is forbidden, not because it defiles the speaker’s own soul, and is an offence in the pure eyes of God, but because it is a sin against others, pulling down instead of building them up, and aggravating, instead of supplying, their moral defects. Like the falsehood, and wrath, and dishonesty, forbidden above, it sins against the unity of all in God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers....">Ephesians 4:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let no corrupt communication — </span>Or discourse, dictated by corruption in the heart of the speaker, and tending to corrupt the minds or manners of hearers; <span class="ital">proceed out of your mouth — </span>At any time, or on any occasion.

The apostle does not merely include in this expression obscene discourse of every kind, but also all flattery, calumny, railing, boasting, tale-bearing, backbiting, commendations of vice and impiety, profane jestings on religion, its ministers and professors, trifling conversation; and, indeed, all discourse that is not either about necessary business, or, as the next clause expresses it, is not <span class="ital">good to the use of edifying </span>— Calculated to instruct, direct, reprove, encourage, excite to duty, comfort, or in some way edify and <span class="ital">minister grace to the hearers.

But he acts, on the occasion referred to, as men do who are grieved. And the purport of the caution is, Do not cause him, by any sinful temper, word, or work, to withdraw from you, as a friend does whom you grieve by unkind or improper behaviour. The expression conveys a strong idea of the love which the Holy Spirit bears to men in general, and to the disciples of Christ in particular; and of his desire to promote their salvation. <span class="ital">Whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption</span> — The time when you shall receive the redemption of your bodies from the grave; (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>;) shall be acquitted at the judgment-seat of Christ, fully delivered from all the consequences of sin, and made perfectly and unchangeably happy: the day when your redemption will be fully completed.

It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no corrupt communication proceed - see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>. The word rendered "corrupt" (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  sapros) means bad, decayed, rotten, and is applied to putrid vegetable or animal substances. Then it is applied to a tree that is of a useless character, that produces no good fruit; <a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17</a>. Then it is used in a moral sense, as our word "corrupt" is, to denote that which is depraved, evil. contaminating, and may denote here anything that is obscene, offensive, or that tends to corrupt others. The importance of this admonition will be appreciated when it is remembered:<p>(1) that such obscene and filthy conversation prevailed everywhere, and does still among the pagan. So general is this, that at almost every missionary station it has been found that the common conversation is so corrupt and defiling that missionaries have felt it necessary to send their children home to be educated, in order to secure them from the contaminating influence of those around them.<p>(2) those who have had the misfortune to be familiar with the common conversation of the lower classes in any community, and especially with the conversation of young men, will see the importance of this admonition. Scarcely anything can be conceived more corrupt or corrupting, than that which often prevails among young men - and even young men in the academies and colleges of this land,<p>(3) its importance will be seen from the "influence" of such corrupt communications. "The passage of an impure thought through the mind leaves pollution behind it;" the expression of such a thought deepens the pollution on the soul, and corrupts others. It is like retaining an offensive carcase above ground, to pollute the air, and to diffuse pestilence and death, which should at once be buried out of sight. A Christian should be pure in his conversation. His Master was pure. His God is pure. The heaven to which he goes is pure. The religion which he professes is pure. Never should he indulge himself in an obscene allusion: never should he retail anecdotes of an obscene character, or smile when they are retailed by others. Never should he indulge in a jest having a double meaning; never should be listen to a song of this character. If those with whom he associates have not sufficient respect for themselves and him to abstain from such corrupt and corrupting allusions, he should at once leave them.<p>But that which is good to the use of edifying - Margin, to edify profitably." Greek, "to useful edification:" that is, adapted to instruct, counsel, and comfort others; to promote their intelligence anti purity. Speech is an invaluable gift; a blessing of inestimable worth. We may so speak as "always" to do good to others. We may give them some information which they have not; impart some consolation which they need; elicit some truth by friendly discussion which we did not know before, or recall by friendly admonition those who are in danger of going astray. He who talks for the mere sake of talking will say many foolish things; he whose great aim in life is to benefit others, will not be likely to say that which he will have occasion to regret; compare <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. corrupt&#8212;literally, "insipid," without "the salt of grace" (Col 4:6), so worthless and then becoming corrupt: included in "foolish talking" (Eph 5:4).

Here it does not seem to mean <span class="ital">filthy</span>, but, as the following clause, <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., suggests, <span class="ital">bad, profitless, of no good to any one</span>. Some, however, give it the more specific sense, = <span class="ital">foul</span>, as including <span class="ital">scurrilous</span> and <span class="ital">unbecoming</span> utterance (Abb.).—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἴ τις ἀγαθὸς πρὸς οἰκοδομὴν τῆς χρείας</span>: <span class="ital">but such as is good for edification of the need</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἴ τις</span>, = <span class="ital">but such as, but whatever</span>; lit. = “but if there is any … let it proceed out of your mouth” (Mey.). <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span> with <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> or <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is sufficiently frequent in classical Greek in the sense of <span class="ital">suitable, serviceable for</span> something (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span>, vii., p. 522 A). The phrase <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομὴν τῆς χρείας</span> is somewhat difficult to construe. Its difficulty probably accounts for the reading <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">χρείας</span> in [476]1[477], etc. It cannot be dealt with by inversion as it is put in the AV, “to the use of edifying”; nor as equivalent to “those who have need” (Rück.); nor as = “as there may be need” (Erasm., <span class="ital">qua sit opus</span>). Neither can it be a gen. of quality, as if = “seasonable edification”. The <span class="greekheb">τῆς</span> must have its full value, especially after the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομήν</span>; and the <span class="greekheb">χρείας</span> is best taken either as the <span class="ital">gen. obj.</span>, = “edification applied to the need” (Mey., Alf., Abb.), or the gen. of <span class="ital">remote reference</span> (Ell.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 235), “edification in reference to the need,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to the <span class="ital">present</span> need. So the Vulg. (am.) gives <span class="ital">ad aedificationem opportunitatis</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα δῷ χάριν τοῖς ἀκούουσι</span>: <span class="ital">that it may give grace to the hearers</span>. So the RV. The AV also gives “minister grace unto the hearers”. The other old English versions likewise render <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>, <span class="ital">grace</span>, except Tynd., who makes it “that it may have favour,” and Cov., who renders it “that it be gracious to hear”. Not a few (Theod., Luth., Rück., etc.) make it = <span class="ital">give pleasure</span>. But <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> usually means <span class="ital">favour</span> or <span class="ital">benefit</span>, and the phrase <span class="greekheb">διδόναι χάριν</span> expresses the idea of <span class="ital">doing a kindness</span> to one (Soph., <span class="ital">Ajax.</span>, 1333; Plato, <span class="ital">Laws</span>, iii., p. 702 c; <a href="/exodus/3-21.htm" title="And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty.">Exodus 3:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm" title="For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.">Psalm 84:11</a>); and in the NT it has this sense with the specific notion of <span class="ital">gracious</span> kindness or service (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2 Corinthians 1:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace.

Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1 Peter 5:5</a>). So it is here. The <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> is the <span class="ital">subj.</span>, and the clause gives the Christian object of every <span class="ital">speech</span> or <span class="ital">utterance, viz.</span>, to do good to the hearers, to <span class="ital">impart a blessing</span> to them (Ell.). For words with a different result <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[476] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[477] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.
