The correct rendering is, <span class= "ital">being true in love; </span>including in this the “being true” to others, by speaking truly and acting honestly towards them (as in <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>), but including also the “being true” absolutely—that is, the loving the truth, and clinging to it at all costs. The latter element, indeed, is the one which stands here more properly in antithesis to the childish instability described in the preceding verse; as it is in itself the more important, and is, in fact, the only basis for the other.<p>“To thine own self be true,<p>And it will follow, as the night the day,<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.”<p>This “being true” is expressed in many forms. Sometimes as “being of the truth” (<a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1John 2:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1John 3:19</a>); sometimes as “abiding in the truth” (<a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>), or “having the truth in us” (<a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1John 1:8</a>); sometimes as “doing the truth” (<a href="/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>), and “walking in the truth” (<a href="/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-4.htm" title="I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.">3John 1:4</a>). In all cases it is closely connected with the idea of unity with Him who is Himself “the Truth” (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>).<p>With the phrase “being true in love” we may compare the corresponding phrase of “loving in truth . . . for the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us” (<a href="/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1</a>; see also <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a>, and <a href="/3_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.">3John 1:1</a>). In both we recognise the harmony of the two great principles of individuality and unity, on which true humanity, and therefore likeness to God, depends. In the contemplation and love of truth each of us is alone; even in the speaking and doing truth towards others we have to consult only God and our own conscience, which is His voice within. In love, on the contrary, we deny and sacrifice self, merging our individual being in humanity or in God. Taking the first alone, we have a hard, almost stoical, self-concentration; taking the other alone, it may become towards man an idolatry, to which both truth and freedom are sacrificed, and even towards God may pass into a mysticism, in which all active energy is lost. Uniting both, we have the perfect humanity, at once individual and social, at once free before God and lost in God. Accordingly, it is thus that we “grow up into Him who is the Head, even Christ,” who, by perfect truth and perfect love, manifested to us in His humanity all the fulness of God.<p><span class= "bld">The head, even Christ.</span>—In this name of our Lord we have the link of connection between the individual perfection and corporate unity. He is (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>) the Head of each man. He is also the Head of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:...">Ephesians 4:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">But speaking the truth </span>— Or, as <span class="greekheb">αληθευοντες </span>may be rendered, <span class="ital">teaching, </span>or <span class="ital">maintaining the truth; in love </span>— To God and one another, or in that charitable temper which the gospel enjoins, and without which our clearest and most extensive knowledge will be but of little use to us; <span class="ital">may grow up into him </span>— Into his image and Spirit, and into a full union with him; <span class="ital">who is the head </span>of guidance, as well as of government, to all the members of his mystical body, the chief teacher and director, as well as ruler of his churches; <span class="ital">from whom </span>— That is, by wisdom and grace derived from him; <span class="ital">the whole body </span>— Of true Christians; <span class="ital">fitly </span>— Or orderly; <span class="ital">joined together </span>— Every one being put in his proper place and station: or all the parts of his mystical body being fitted for, and adapted to each other, and most exactly harmonizing with the whole; <span class="ital">and compacted </span>— Knitted and cemented together with the utmost firmness; that is, closely and firmly united to Christ and each other, by the Holy Spirit, in faith and love; <span class="ital">by that which every joint, </span>or part, <span class="ital">supplieth — </span>Through proper channels of communication; <span class="ital">according to the effectual working in the measure of every part </span>— According as every part, in its measure, effectually works for the support and growth of the whole; <span class="ital">maketh increase of the body </span>— Of the whole church, collectively considered, and of each particular member; <span class="ital">to the edifying </span>— Or building up; <span class="ital">of itself in love </span>— So that all the members may attain unto a greater measure of love to God, one another, and all men; or, <span class="ital">by </span>the exercise of <span class="ital">love. </span>For, as no animal body can either have health or growth, unless the members thereof continue in union with each other, each performing its office; so neither can Christ’s mystical body possess spiritual health or growth, unless its members cleave to each other in love. The passage, as the reader sees, is a beautiful allusion to our natural bodies, composed of different joints and members, knit together by various ligaments, and furnished with vessels of communication from the head and heart to every other part. And the apostle’s meaning, explained more at large, is, “That as the human body is formed by the union of all the members to each other under the head, and by the fitness of each member for its own office and place in the body, so the church is formed by the union of its members under Christ the head. Further, as the human body increases, till it arrives at maturity, by the energy of every part in performing its proper function, and by the sympathy of every part with the whole; so the body, or Church of Christ, grows to maturity by the proper exercise of the gifts and graces of individuals for the benefit of the whole. By comparing the church to the human body, the apostle teaches, that there ought to be no envy nor ill-will among Christians, on account of the gifts which individuals possess, <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a>.

And that each, by employing his gifts and graces properly, should extend the knowledge and influence of the Christian religion to the utmost of his power.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But speaking the truth in love - Margin, "being sincere." The translation in the text is correct - literally, "truthing in love" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  ale&#772;theuontes. Two things are here to be noted:<p>(1) The truth is "to be spoken" - the simple, unvarnished truth. This is the way to avoid error, and this is the way to preserve others from error. In opposition to all trick, and art, and cunning, and fraud, and deception, Christians are to speak the simple truth, and nothing but the truth. Every statement which they make should be unvarnished truth; every promise which they make should be true; every representation which they make of the sentiments of others should he simple truth. "Truth is the representation of things as they are;" and there is no virtue that is more valuable in a Christian than the love of simple truth.<p>(2) the second thing is, that the truth should be spoken "in love." There are other ways of speaking truth. It is sometimes spoken in a harsh, crabby, sour manner, which does nothing but disgust and offend When we state truth to others, it should he with love to their souls, and with a sincere desire to do them good. When we admonish a brother of his faults, it should not be in a harsh and unfeeling manner, but in love. Where a minister pronounces the awful truth of God about depravity, death, the judgment, and future woe, it should be in love. It should not be done in a harsh and repulsive manner; it should not he done as if he rejoiced that people were in danger of hell, or as if he would like to pass the final sentence; it should not be with indifference, or in a tone of superiority. And in like manner, if we go to convince one who is in error, we should approach him in love. We should not dogmatize, or denounce, or deal out anathemas. Such things only repel. "He has done about half his work in convincing another of error who has first convinced him that he loves him;" and if he does not do that, he may argue to the hour of his death and make no progress in convincing him.<p>May grow up into him - Into Christ; that is, to the stature of a complete man in him.<p>Which is the head - <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a> note; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. speaking the truth&#8212;Translate, "holding the truth"; "following the truth"; opposed to "error" or "deceit" (Eph 4:14).<p>in love&#8212;"Truth" is never to be sacrificed to so-called "charity"; yet it is to be maintained in charity.

Against the second of these interpretations (Luther, etc.) there is also in particular the context, seeing that <span class="ital">sincere love</span> would be a quite unsuitable contrast to the spiritual immaturity given up to the false teachers, which is described <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>. If, however, we should seek to connect <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύειν</span> in the correct sense of <span class="ital">verum dicere</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> (<span class="ital">confessing the truth in love</span>), then only the love not towards others in general (this in opposition to Hofmann), but towards those of <span class="ital">another confession</span>, could be meant; and this too, would here, where the latter are described as deceptive teachers of error, be at variance with the context. Harless, it is true, rightly connects <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> with <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσ</span>., but explains <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες</span>: <span class="ital">being true in evangelical disposition</span>, and then brings <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ εἰς αὐτόν</span> together. Against this may be urged, not indeed the hyperbaton (Bernhardy, p. 460; Kühner, II. p. 627 f.), but the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἀληθ</span>. is not taken in accordance with correct linguistic usage, and that the definition “<span class="ital">in evangelical disposition</span>” is imported at variance with the context (since we have here a contrast not to the <span class="greekheb">πανουργία</span> of the false teachers, but to the childish <span class="greekheb">περιφέρεσθαι παντὶ ἀνέμῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.); as also that the corresponding <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> of <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a> shows that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> in <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a> does not mean love <span class="ital">to Christ</span>.

Christ is indeed the Head of the body, the growth of the members of which thus stands in constant <span class="ital">relation to Christ</span>, can never take place apart from relation to Him as determining and regulating it, to whom the course of the development must harmoniously correspond. The commentary to <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span> is furnished by the following <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; the relation of the growth to the head, which is expressed in an ascending direction by, <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span>, is expressed in a descending direction by <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>.[227] The sense: <span class="ital">into the resemblance of Christ</span> (Zanchius and others), is opposed to the context (since Christ is thought of as <span class="ital">head</span>); as also the explanation of Koppe and Holzhausen (comp. de Wette and Bleek): “<span class="ital">to grow up in Him</span>,” is inappropriate, since the body as little <span class="ital">grows up</span> to the head, or <span class="ital">reaches forth</span> to the head (Hofmann), as it grows into the head (in opposition to Matthies: “<span class="ital">to grow into Him</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>… ever more deeply to become absorbed into His infinitely true and holy nature”). Others have taken <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>,[228] but this was a mistaken makeshift, whether it was explained with Cornelius a Lapide: “Christi capitis <span class="ital">virtute et influxu</span>,” or even with Grotius: “ipsius <span class="ital">cognitione</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>] is rightly explained: <span class="ital">in all points, in every respect</span> (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things.

Harless refers it to the previously mentioned <span class="greekheb">ἑνότης</span> in its contrast to the wavering of unsettled knowledge. But since the <span class="greekheb">ἑνότης</span> of <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a> appears as the <span class="ital">goal</span> to be attained by the growth, and since, moreover, not <span class="ital">several things</span> (a plurality) are thereby denoted, to which the <span class="ital">plural</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> might relate, this view cannot appear in keeping with the context. The explanation which most naturally suggests itself is: in all the points of our growth, wherein the emphasis remains upon <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span>. Our growth shall, in all points in which we grow, proceed <span class="ital">in relation to Him</span>, who is the Head, etc. Koppe, Wahl, and Holzhausen regard <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> as <span class="ital">nominative</span>, explaining it of all the <span class="ital">members</span>. But in that case <span class="greekheb">οἱ πάντες</span> must have been written.

A participial clause qualifying the following <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span> and introducing the positive side of the change in view as contrasted with the negative aspect of the same in the <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι</span> clause.

The precise meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες</span> is disputed. The RV marg. makes it “dealing truly”; but that is a doubtful sense. Calvin takes it = <span class="ital">veritati operam dare</span>; Rückert, “holding fast the truth”; Ell., “holding the truth”; Olsh., “walking in truth”; Alf., “being followers of truth”. But in classical Greek the verb seems to mean to <span class="ital">speak truth</span> as opposed to <span class="greekheb">ψεύδεσθαι</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span>, p. 589 c; Xen., <span class="ital">Anab.</span>, i., 7, 18, iv., 4, 15, etc.), and that is its sense also in <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>. It is best to take it here, too, as = “speaking truth”; or more definitely “confessing the truth”. The point of this brief, but significant clause, therefore, may be this—these Ephesians had learned the saving truth (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀληθεία</span>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm" title="For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc.) of Christ. They had been exposed to the treacheries and risks of false teaching. Christ had given them Apostles, prophets, and evangelists to secure them against all teachers of craft, and they are here charged to continue to confess the truth in which they had been instructed and so grow to the maturity of the Christian life.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>: <span class="ital">in love</span>. The question is—to what is this to be attached? It is connected by many (Syr., Eth., Theophy., Oecum., Erasm., Calv., Rück., Bleek, de Wette, Alf., AV, RV, etc.) with the <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες</span>, and it is taken to express the idea that love is the element in which truth is to be spoken (or the truth confessed), if it is to conduce to unity and brotherliness. This construction is supported by the considerations that the simple <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες δέ</span> would be somewhat bald if it stood wholly by itself; that it is natural to associate <span class="ital">love</span> and <span class="ital">truth</span>; that the position of <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> <span class="ital">after</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύοντες</span> and also the parallel structure of <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a> point to this connection; and that we thus get a contrast between <span class="greekheb">πανουργία</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span> and again between <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύειν</span>. The main argument for connecting the clause rather with the following <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span> (= “but speaking truth (or rather, confessing the truth) may in love grow up”) is the fact that in <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, where the climax is reached, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> qualifies the main thought—that of the <span class="ital">growth</span> or the <span class="ital">edification</span> of Christ’s body. This is a consideration of such weight as to throw the probability on the whole on the side of the second connection (Mey., Alf., Haupt, etc.).—<span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν εἰς αὐτὸν τὰ πάντα</span>: <span class="ital">may grow up unto him in all things</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span>, which is under the regimen of the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, has here, as in <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> and in various other passages of the NT, the intr. sense of <span class="ital">growing</span>. In earlier classical Greek it meant to <span class="ital">cause to grow</span>. That sense it has in the LXX and also occasionally in the NT (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase....">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>), while the pass. is used to express <span class="ital">growing</span>. But from Arist. onwards it came also to have the <span class="ital">intr.</span> sense. Meyer takes <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span> to mean simply “<span class="ital">in reference</span> to him”. The idea then would be that it is only by being <span class="ital">in relation</span> to Christ that we can grow. But while it is true that the growth which is set before us as our aim depends wholly on our remaining in living relation to Christ, the phrase <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span> can scarcely bear this out, but, as restricted by Meyer, would mean only “as regards him”. The <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span> must have a more definite sense. It might mean “into him” (AV, RV, Ell., etc.), in the sense of becoming wholly <span class="ital">incorporated</span> in Him, or made one with Him, or in the sense of growing till our life has “its centre <span class="ital">in</span> Him,” as Ell. would put it. But this is an idea difficult to grasp, and not quite in harmony with the conception of Christ as <span class="ital">Head</span>. For the members to grow <span class="ital">into</span> the head is not a congruous idea. It is best, therefore, to give <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> the sense of “unto,” Christ the Head being the <span class="ital">end</span> and <span class="ital">object</span> of the growth of the members. This means more than that we are to grow into <span class="ital">resemblance</span> to Him, or that our growth is be according to His <span class="ital">example</span>. It means that as He is the source <span class="ital">from</span> which (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>) the grace or power comes that makes it possible for us to grow, He is also the <span class="ital">object</span> and <span class="ital">goal</span> to which our growth in its every stage must look and is to be directed. This is more in harmony with the previous <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἄνδρα τέλειον</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἰς μέτρον ἡλικίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The <span class="ital">extent</span> or <span class="ital">scope</span> of this growing into Christ is expressed by <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> (the acc. of <span class="ital">def.</span> or acc. of <span class="ital">quantitative</span> object.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Krüger, <span class="ital">Sprachl.</span>, § 46, 5, 4), = in all that belongs to our growth; in all the power and circumstances of our growth. The simple <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> is so used in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>. Here <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> is in place, the idea being, as Meyer rightly observes, the definite idea of <span class="ital">all the points in which we grow</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλή</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>: <span class="ital">who is the head even Christ</span>. With [410] [411] [412] [413], Chrys., etc., the TR reads <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>. The article is rightly omitted, however, by LTTrWHRV on the authority of the oldest and best MSS., [414] [415] [416] [417], with Bas., Cyr., etc. Instead of the ordinary form of direct apposition <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span>, the relative form is adopted, probably with a view both to emphasis, and to definiteness in the connection with <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

It has been well said that some men find love the easier precept, some truth; but that the Gospel enjoins the harmony of both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">grow</span> up] The metaphor of the living Body reappears.

Truth is the element in which we are to live, move, and have our being; fidelity to truth is the backbone of the Christian ministry. But truth must be inseparably married to love; good tidings spoken harshly are no good tidings; the charm of the message is destroyed by the discordant spirit of the messenger. The more painful the first impression which a truth is fitted to produce (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Ephesians</span> 2:1-3), the more need is there for dealing with it in love - a much-needed and much-neglected exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">May grow up into him in all things who is the Head, namely, Christ.</span> Growing up <span class="accented">into</span> Christ is like baptizing <span class="accented">into</span> the Name of the Father, etc.; it implies that the growth tends to a closer union to Christ, as, on the other hand, union to Christ causes the growth: the two act and react on each other. This growth is to be "in all things"  - in the whole man - in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, in all the communicable properties of Christ. How great the work of growth is that should be sought in the case of every living believer is evident from the enormous gulf there is between his spiritual and moral state and that of Christ. Yet such growth is reasonable, considering the relation of the body to him, its Head. The fact of this relation should encourage us to seek and expect the growth, and encourage ministers to labor hopefully towards promoting it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Speaking the truth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>.
