Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ.

If this reason were valid, an <span class="ital">absolute</span> bodily omnipresence would result: it proves <span class="ital">too much</span>, and leads to a <span class="ital">contradictio in adjecto</span>, which could only receive a Docetic solution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[212] <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἄλλος κατελήλυθε καὶ ἄλλος ἀνελήλυθεν</span>, Theodoret.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[213] Wrongly are Oecumenius and Theophylact adduced as favouring this explanation. They, forsooth, very correctly refer the filling to the dominion and operation of Christ (comp. also Chrysostom), and observe with equal justice that Christ, after He had already before His incarnation filled all things by His purely divine nature, now, after having, as the Incarnate One, descended and ascended, does the filling of the universe <span class="greekheb">μετὰ σαρκός</span> (Oecumenius), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> so that in doing so He is in a different state than before, namely, <span class="ital">clothed with a body</span>, consequently as <span class="ital">God-man</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ καταβάς</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτός ἐστι καὶ ὁ ἀναβάς</span>: <span class="ital">he that descended, he it is that also ascended</span> (or, <span class="ital">he himself also ascended</span>). It was the first thought of every Christian mind that Christ had come down from heaven to live and work among men on earth for their salvation. Founding on this Paul declares that He who descended, whom all knew to be Christ, He and no other was also the Person who ascended. So he reminds his readers of the source of all the gifts in operation in the Church or enjoyed by individual Christians—the ascended Christ. A peculiar force is claimed by some (Von Soden, Abb., Bruston) for the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in <span class="greekheb">καὶ κατέβη</span>. It is argued that it represents the descent as <span class="ital">subsequent</span> to the ascent, and contemporaneous with the giving of the gifts. So the point is taken to be this—that the ascent would have been without a purpose unless it had been followed by a descent. This, it is thought, is the reason why Paul pauses to say that the ascending implied also a descending and that the Person in view not only ascended but also descended. Hence what is in the writer’s mind here is held not to be the incarnation or humiliation of the pre-existent Christ, but the descent of the exalted Christ to His Church, supposed to be referred to also in such passages as <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>, <a href="/context/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh....">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>. But it is nowhere taught in the Pauline Epistles that a descent or a departure from heaven after the exaltation was necessary in order that the ascended Lord might bestow gifts upon His Church. The passages cited do not bear out any such idea. The first (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>) does not refer to a coming of the glorified Christ; the second (<a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>) speaks only of the spiritual presence of Christ in the heart; and the third (<a href="/context/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh....">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>) deals obviously with a “mystery” of <span class="ital">relations</span>, and has nothing to do with any coming of Christ out of heaven following on His ascension or required for the bestowal of His gifts. Nor is there any reason why the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> should have more than the familiar <span class="ital">additive</span> force.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν</span>: <span class="ital">up above all the heavens</span>. So in <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a> our High Priest is described as <span class="greekheb">ὑψηλότερος τῶν οὐρανῶν γενόμενος</span>. There may be. an allusion here to the Jewish ideas of a gradation of heavens, a series of <span class="ital">three</span> or, as the case rather appears to stand, <span class="ital">seven</span> heavens, with which the Pauline <span class="greekheb">τρίτος οὐρανός</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>) may also be connected; on the conceptions of a plurality of heavens which prevailed among the Jews, the Babylonians and other ancient peoples, see the writer’s article on “Heaven” in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>. But the point of the phrase as we have it here is simply this—that whatever heavens there are or may be, Christ is above them all. So high has His ascension carried Him. It means the highest possible exaltation—the supremacy of One who shares in the sovereignty of God. For the term <span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω</span> see on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα πληρώσῃ τὰ πάντα</span>: <span class="ital">that He might fill all things</span>. The use of the conj. with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> after a past tense may be due to the fact that the “filling” is to be viewed as a continuous action (Ell., Alf.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Klotz, <span class="ital">Devar.</span>, ii., p. 618), if it is not to be explained simply by the laxer employment of the conj. in NT Greek. The sense of <span class="ital">fulfilling</span> or <span class="ital">completing</span> hat been given by many to the <span class="greekheb">πληρώσῃ</span>. Thus the idea has been taken by some to be that of the fulfilling of <span class="ital">prophecy</span> (Anselm, etc.), the <span class="ital">accomplishment</span> of all things that Christ had to do in His redeeming mission (Rück.), the <span class="ital">making of all perfect</span> (Oltr.), etc. But, as in <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>, the verb has the sense of <span class="ital">filling</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> is to be taken again in its widest application, and is not to be restricted to the world of <span class="ital">believers</span> or to the Church of Jew and Gentile (Grot., Schenk., etc.). Nor is there anything to suggest that the <span class="ital">ubiquity</span> of Christ’s body is in view, as some Lutherans have argued (Hunn., Calov., etc.). The idea that is in the paragraph is not that of a “diffused and ubiquitous corporeity,” as Ellicott well expresses it, but that of a “pervading and energising omnipresence”. The thought is the larger one that the object of Christ’s ascension was that He might enter into regal relation with the whole world and in that position and prerogative bestow His gifts as He willed and as they were needed. He was exalted in order that He might take kingly sway, fill the universe with His activity as its Sovereign and Governor, and His Church with His presence as its Head, and provide His people with all needful grace and gifts. In OT prophecy to “fill heaven and earth” is the note of Deity (<a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm" title="Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? said the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).—We may be in a position now to determine Paul’s object in introducing the passage from Psalms 68. and in applying it as he does. The general connection is clear enough. He bids his readers study lowliness, forbearance and unity, because there is one faith, one baptism, etc. They are not to be vexed or divided because one may have more of the gift of grace than another. All receive from Christ, each in his own way and measure as Christ wills; for, as the Psalm shows, all gifts come from Him. Now some take the point of the quotation to be this—He who is the subject of the Psalm is One whose seat is in heaven, a Sovereign Giver of gifts (Ell.). Others are of opinion that the words are cited in order to bring out the fact that Christ’s bestowal of gifts “stands in necessary connection with His general position of filling the whole universe” (Mey.). But the case appears to be less involved than that, and to turn simply on the identification of the Person who is the source of the gifts. Paul has spoken of the grace as <span class="ital">given</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐδόθη</span>, <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>), and he has quoted the words of the Psalm which say that “he gave gifts” (<span class="greekheb">ἔδωκεν δόματα</span>, <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>). But he has not <span class="ital">named</span> the Giver. Now he explains that the Giver is Christ; and that this is indicated by the Psalm itself, because it sings of One who went up on high, and of an ascent which presupposed a previous descent. Thus he identifies the subject of the Psalm with Christ; as elsewhere the Jehovah of the Prophets and the Psalms is identified with the Christ of the Apostles, and what is affirmed of the former in the OT is ascribed to the latter in the NT.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">He that descended</span>, &c.] As if to say, “Yes, He once descended, as a step in the process, a means to the great end; but now we have to dwell on the result; this Descender has now become by consequence the Ascended One, giving gifts from the Throne.” Both parts of the statement are emphatic, the fact and wonder of the Descent, and the triumph and result of the Ascent; and they are in deep connexion. But the main stress is on the latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">far above all heavens</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">all the heavens</span>. Cp. <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; where the ascended High Priest is revealed as “having passed through the heavens,” and as “become loftier than the heavens.”—Scripture gives no precise revelation as to the number or order of regions or spheres of the upper world, the unseen universe of life and bliss. But its frequent use of the plural in regard of it, as here, whatever the origin of the usage, sanctions the thought that the Blessed (angels and glorified men), while from other points of view eternally concentrated and in company, and doubtless able, under their spiritual conditions of existence, to realize and act upon their unity to a degree unimagined by us, are yet distributed, classed, and ordered. “The Rabbis spoke of two heavens, or seven” (Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, under the word <span class="ital">Heaven;</span> and see Wetstein on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). St Paul himself speaks (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>) of a “third heaven,” meaning, apparently, the immediate presence of God; possibly with a reference to the <span class="ital">twofold</span> division mentioned just above, and which, if so, is to some degree favoured by Scripture. The plain meaning of the present passage, in any case, is that the Lord passed through and beyond all regions of created blessedness into the region of the Throne. That Throne (we can only use the language of figure, permitted by the Scriptures,) is as truly “far above” the highest sphere of created life as it is “far above” the lowest. To both it stands in the mysterious relation of the uncreated to the created. Cp. <a href="/context/psalms/113-5.htm" title="Who is like to the LORD our God, who dwells on high,...">Psalm 113:5-6</a>. See further above, note on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>.—From another point of view, He who is “far above” the heavens is (like His Father) “in heaven” (below, <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>).

But St Paul’s usage favours the other version. He ascended that He might, not only in possibility but in act, “fill all things,” “with His presence, His sovereignty, His working by the Spirit; not with His glorified body, as some have thought” (Alford). “There is here no reference to a diffused and ubiquitous corporeity, but to a pervading and energizing omnipresence … Christ is perfect God, and perfect and glorified Man; as the former He is present <span class="ital">everywhere</span>, as the latter He can be present <span class="ital">anywhere</span>” (Bp Ellicott).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτὸς</span>) <span class="ital">He</span>, not another.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν</span>, <span class="ital">far above all heavens</span>) A very sublime expression.

The specific idea with which the apostle started - to give gifts to men - is swallowed up for the moment by a view far grander and more comprehensive, "<span class="accented">to</span> fill all things." Jesus has gone on high to pour his glory and excellence over every creature in the universe who is the subject of grace, to be the Light of the world, the one Source of all good. As in the solar system it is from one sun that all the supplies of light and heat come, all the colors that beautify earth, <span class="accented">sea</span>, and sky, all the influences that ripen the grain and mature the fruit, all the chemical power that transforms and new-creates; so the ascended Jesus is the Sun of the universe; all healing, all life, all blessing are from him. It is quite in the manner of the apostle, when he introduces the mention of Christ, to be carried, in the contemplation of his person, far above the immediate occasion, and extol the infinite perfection and glory that distinguish him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Fill all things<p>Compare <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. </body></html>
