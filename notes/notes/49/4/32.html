It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And be ye kind one to another - Benignant, mild, courteous, "polite" -  &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  chre&#772;stoi. <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>. Christianity produces true courteousness, or politeness. It does not make one rough, crabby, or sour; nor does it dispose its followers to violate the proper rules of social contact. The secret of true politeness is "benevolence," or a desire to make others happy; and a Christian should be the most polite of people. There is no religion in a sour, misanthropic temper; none in rudeness, stiffness, and repulsiveness; none in violating the rules of good breeding. There is a hollow-hearted politeness, indeed, which the Christian is not to aim at or copy. His politeness is to be based on "kindness;" <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>. His courtesy is to be the result of love, good-will, and a desire of the happiness of all others; and this will prompt to the kind of conduct that will render his conversation. with others agreeable and profitable.<p>Tender-hearted - Having a heart disposed to pity and compassion, and especially disposed to show kindness to the faults of erring brethren; for so the connection demands.<p>Forgiving one another - see the notes on <a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>.<p>As God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you - As God, on account of what Christ has suffered and done, has pardoned you. He has done it:<p>(1) "freely" - without merit on your part - when we were confessedly in the wrong.<p>(2) "fully;" he has forgiven "every" offence.<p>(3) "Liberally;" he has forgiven "many" offences, for our sins have been innumerable.<p>This is to be the rule which we are to observe in forgiving others. We are to do it "freely, fully, liberally." The forgiveness is to be entire, cordial, constant. We are not to "rake up" old offences, and charge them again upon them; we are to treat them as though they had not offended, for so God treats us Learn:<p>(1) That the forgiveness of an offending brother is a duty which we are not at liberty to neglect.<p>(2) the peace and happiness of the church depend on it. All are liable to offend their brethren, as all are liable to offend God; all need forgiveness of one another, as we all need it of God.<p>(3) there is no danger of carrying it too far. Let the rule be observed, "As God has forgiven you, so do you forgive others." Let a man recollect his own sins and follies; let him look over his life, and see how often he has offended God; let him remember that all has been forgiven; and then, fresh with this feeling, let him go and meet an offending brother, and say, "My brother, I forgive you. I do it frankly, fully, wholly. So Christ has forgiven me; so I forgive you. The offence shall be no more remembered. It shall not be referred to in our contact to harrow up your feelings; it shall not diminish my love for you; it shall not prevent my uniting with you in doing good.

Its primitive meaning is “<span class="ital">useful</span>”; hence “helpful,” and so “kindly.”—It is the original of “easy” in <a href="/matthew/11-30.htm" title="For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:30</a>; the Lord’s “yoke” is a real yoke, but instinct with the lovingkindness of Him who imposes it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">tender-hearted</span>] The same Gr. word as in <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1 Peter 3:8</a> (A.V., “<span class="ital">pitiful</span>”). It occurs nowhere else in N.T. <span class="bld">Kind-hearted</span> may perhaps be a better rendering, as somewhat wider. The word carries the idea of the previous word a little more into life and detail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">forgiving one another</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">forgiving yourselves</span>.” Usage and common sense alike fully justify the rendering of A.V. and R.V. (which reads, somewhat needlessly, “<span class="ital">each</span> other”). The “yourselves,” as a grammatical fact, indicates the solidarity of the body within which the reciprocity takes place; though this fine shade of meaning must not be exaggerated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a close parallel to the precept see <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a>. The holy duty of heartfelt forgiveness, entire and unreserved, is prominent in the Lord’s teaching; cp. especially the Lord’s Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm" title="And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.">Matthew 6:12</a>; <a href="/luke/11-4.htm" title="And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.">Luke 11:4</a>); <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm" title="Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?">Matthew 18:21</a>, &c. No duty is more readily owned in the abstract, none more repugnant to the will in many a case in the concrete. But the law of Christ knows no exceptions, and grace is able to meet every demand for fulfilment.—It is humbling and instructive to see here, as in the Lord’s Prayer, that the <span class="ital">abiding need</span> for mutual forgiveness is assumed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even as</span>] The Divine pardon is at once supreme example and sacred motive. Cp. just below, ch. <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God</span>] The Father, “Fount of Deity,” and as such styled often simply God where Christ is also and distinctively named (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="All the saints salute you.">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; Judges 21). The Son has also Deity, but as in the Stream, not in the Fountain. See Pearson, <span class="ital">On the Creed</span>, Art. 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for Christ’s sake</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">in Christ</span>. The reason of pardon, and the process of it, are alike summed up “in Christ,” “in” Whom the Father reveals Himself as God of Peace: “in” Whom resides the immediate atoning <span class="ital">reason</span> of Peace; and “in” Whom, by grace and faith, are the human objects of pardon, “very members incorporate” of Him Who is eternally the Accepted One of the Father.—Cp. <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath forgiven</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">did forgive</span>; ideally and in covenant, “before the world was”; historically, when the Son was accepted and glorified as the perfect Propitiation, raised from the dead; in individual experience, when each person believed (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>, &c.) It is important to observe how the Apostle bids them deal with Divine forgiveness not as a hope but as a fact. Cp. <a href="/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">you</span>] There is considerable, but not preponderating, evidence for a reading “us”.

The aorist, "<span class="accented">forgave</span>," is more literal and better than the perfect, "hath forgiven;" it points to a definite time when forgiveness was bestowed, viz. the moment of real belief in Christ, and hearty acceptance of his grace. The vague atmosphere in which many envelop the question of their forgiveness is very hurtful; it checks their thanksgivings, dulls their joy, quenches hope, and dilutes the great dynamic power of the gospel - the power that impels us to forgive our brother, as well as to abound in the work of the Lord with a tender conscience, the sense of forgiveness urges to the most full and hearty doing of God's will; but when hypocrites, with seared consciences claim to be forgiven, they steal what is not their own, and become more abandoned to wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be ye (&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>Lit., become, as following the putting away of anger, etc.<p>Kind (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>See on easy, <a href="/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>; see on gracious, <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm">1 Peter 2:3</a>.<p>Each other (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., yourselves.
