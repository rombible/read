but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5-6</a>, <span class= "ital">et</span> al.), so still more to the “Peace of Earth” of the angelic song of Bethlehem, and to the repeated declarations of our Lord, such as, “Peace I leave with you: My peace I give unto you.” Here, however, only is our Lord called not the giver of peace, but the peace itself—His own nature being the actual tie of unity between God and mankind, and between man and man. Through the whole passage thus introduced there runs a double meaning, a declaration of peace in Christ between Jew and Gentile, and between both and God; though it is not always easy to tell of any particular expression, whether it belongs to this or that branch of the meaning, or to both. It is well to compare it with the obvious parallel in <a href="/context/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13-14</a>, where (in accordance with the whole genius of that Epistle) there is found only the latter branch of the meaning, the union of all with the Head, not the unity of the various members of the Body.<p><span class= "bld">Who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.</span>—In this verse the former subject is begun. The reunion of Jew and Gentile is described in close connection with the breaking down of “the middle wall of the partition” (or, <span class= "ital">hedge</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The words “between us” are not in the original, and Chrysostom interprets the partition as being, not between Jew and Gentile, but between both and God. But the former idea seems at any rate to predominate in this clause. Whether “the middle wall of the hedge” refers to the wall separating the court of the Gentiles from the Temple proper (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> § 5), and by an inscription denouncing death to any alien who passed it (see Lewin’s <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>vol. ii., p. 133), or to the “hedge” set about the vineyard of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/22-33.htm" title="And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.">Matthew 22:33</a>)—to which probably the Jewish doctors alluded when they called their ceremonial and legal subtleties “the hedge” of the Law—has been disputed. It may, however, be noted that the charge of bringing Trophimus, an Ephesian, beyond that Temple wall had been the cause of St. Paul’s apprehension at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>), and nearly of his death. Hence the Asiatic churches might well be familiar with its existence. It is also notable that this Temple-partition suits perfectly the double sense of this passage: for, while it was primarily a separation between Jew and Gentile, it was also the first of many partitions—of which the “veil of the Temple” was the last—cutting all men off from the immediate presence of God. At our Lord’s death the last of these partitions was rent in twain; how much more may that death be described as breaking down the first!<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he is our peace - There is evident allusion here to <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>. See the notes at that verse. The "peace" here referred to is that by which a "union" in worship and in feeling has been produced between the Jews and the Gentiles Formerly they were alienated and separate. They had different objects of worship; different religious rites; different views and feelings. The Jews regarded the Gentiles with hatred, and the Gentiles the Jews with scorn. Now, says the apostle, they are at peace. They worship the same God. They have the same Saviour. They depend on the same atonement. They have the same hope. They look forward to the same heaven. They belong to the same redeemed family. Reconciliation has not only taken place with God, but with each other. "The best way to produce peace between alienated minds is to bring them to the same Saviour." That will do more to silence contentions, and to heal alienations, than any or all other means. Bring people around the same cross; fill them with love to the same Redeemer, and give them the same hope of heaven, and you put a period to alienation and strife. The love at Christ is so absorbing, and the dependence in his blood so entire, that they will lay aside these alienations, and cease their contentions. The work of the atonement is thus designed not only to produce peace with God, but peace between alienated and contending minds. The feeling that we are redeemed by the same blood, and that we have the same Saviour, will unite the rich and the poor, the bond and the free, the high and the low, in the ties of brotherhood, and make them feel that they are one. This great work of the atonement is thus designed to produce peace in alienated minds every where, and to diffuse abroad the feeling of universal brotherhood.<p>Who hath made both one - Both Gentiles and Jews. He has united them in one society.<p>And hath broken down the middle wall - There is an allusion here undoubtedly to the wall of partition in the temple by which the court of the Gentiles was separated from that of the Jews; see the notes and the plan of the temple, in <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. The idea here is, that that was now broken down, and that the Gentiles had the same access to the temple as the Jews. The sense is, that in virtue of the sacrifice of the Redeemer they were admitted to the same privileges and hopes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. he&#8212;Greek, "Himself" alone, pre-eminently, and none else. Emphatical.<p>our peace&#8212;not merely "Peacemaker," but "Himself" the price of our (Jews' and Gentiles' alike) peace with God, and so the bond of union between "both" in God. He took both into Himself, and reconciled them, united, to God, by His assuming our nature and our penal and legal liabilities (Eph 2:15; Isa 9:5, 6; 53:5; Mic 5:5; Col 1:20). His title, "Shiloh," means the same (Ge 49:10).<p>the middle wall of partition&#8212;Greek, "&#8230; of the partition" or "fence"; the middle wall which parted Jew and Gentile. There was a balustrade of stone which separated the court of the Gentiles from the holy place, which it was death for a Gentile to pass. But this, though incidentally alluded to, was but a symbol of the partition itself, namely, "the enmity" between "both" and God (Eph 2:15), the real cause of separation from God, and so the mediate cause of their separation from one another. Hence there was a twofold wall of partition, one the inner wall, severing the Jewish people from entrance to the holy part of the temple where the priests officiated, the other the outer wall, separating the Gentile proselytes from access to the court of the Jews (compare Eze 44:7; Ac 21:28). Thus this twofold wall represented the Sinaitic law, which both severed all men, even the Jews, from access to God (through sin, which is the violation of the law), and also separated the Gentiles from the Jews. As the term "wall" implies the strength of the partition, so "fence" implies that it was easily removed by God when the due time came.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For he is our peace; </span> i.e. Peace-maker, or Mediator of peace, both between God and man, and between Jew and Gentile.

The author of peace between Jew and Gentile: there was a great enmity of the Jew against the Gentile, and of the Gentile against the Jew; and chiefly on account of circumcision, the one being without it, and the other insisting on it, and branding one another with nicknames on account of it; but Christ has made peace between them by abrogating the ceremonial law, which was the occasion of the difference, and by sending the Gospel of peace to them both, by converting some of each, and by granting the like privileges to them all, as may be observed in the following verses: and Christ is the author of peace between God and his people; there is naturally in man an enmity to God; sin has separated chief friends; nor can man make his peace with God; what he does, or can do, will not do it; and what will, he cannot do; Christ is the only fit and proper person for this work, being a middle person between both, and is only able to effect it, being God as well as man; and so could draw nigh to God, and treat with him about terms of peace, and agree to them, and perform them; and which he has brought about by his blood, his sufferings and death; and which is made on honourable terms, by a full satisfaction to the law and justice of God; and so is a lasting one, and attended with a train of blessings: moreover, Christ is the donor of peace, of external peace in his churches, and of internal peace of conscience, and of eternal peace in heaven: this is one of the names of the Messiah with the Jews (b); <p>"says R. Jose the Galilean, even the name of the Messiah is called  "peace"; as it is said, <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> "the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace";'' <p>see <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a> where it is said, "and this man shall be the peace"; which the Jewish (c) writers understand of the Messiah: <p>who hath made both one; Jews and Gentiles, one people, one body, one church; he united them together, and caused them to agree in one, and made them to be of one mind and judgment by the above methods; as well as he gathered them together in one, in one head, himself, who represented them all: <p>and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; the ceremonial law, which was made up of many hard and intolerable commands, and distinguished, and divided, and kept up a division between Jews and Gentiles: so the Jews call the law a wall, "if she be a wall", Sol 8:9 , "this is the law", say they (d): and hence we read of , "the wall of the law" (e); and sometimes the phrase, a "partition wall", is used for a division or disagreement; so R. Benjamin says (f), that between the Karaites and Rabbanites, who were the disciples of the wise men, there was  "a middle wall of partition"; a great difference and distance; and such there was between the Jew and Gentile, by reason of the ceremonial law; but Christ removed it, and made up the difference: the allusion seems to be to the wall which divided the court of Israel from the court of the Gentiles, in the temple, and which kept them at a distance in worship. <p>(b) Perek Shalom, fol. 20. 1.

But the twofold designation of the matter, describing it first figuratively and then properly, is in keeping with the <span class="ital">importance</span> of the idea, the direct expression of which produces after the previous figure an effect the <span class="ital">more striking</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To take the genitive in an <span class="ital">adjectival</span> sense, as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τὸ μεσότοιχον διαφράσσον</span> (Vorstius, Grotius, Morus, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Meier, and others), is wrong, because the characteristic adjective notion is implied in <span class="greekheb">τὸ μεσότοιχον</span> (<span class="ital">paries intergerinus</span>, found elsewhere only in Eratosthenes quoted by Athen. vii. p. 281 D, in Hesychius under <span class="greekheb">κατῆλιψ</span>, and in the Fathers[150]), which has been felt also by Castalio and Beza, inasmuch as they erroneously translated it as though <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΦΡΑΓΜῸΝ ΤΟῦ ΜΕΣΟΤΟΊΧΟΥ</span></span></span> were used. A reference, we may add, to a <span class="ital">definite</span> <span class="greekheb">φραγμός</span>, which underlies the figurative expression, is not to be assumed, since the words furnish nothing of the sort, and <span class="ital">any kind</span> of fence serving as a partition-wall illustrates the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span>. Some have thought of the stone screen which in the temple-enclosure marked off the court of the Gentiles, and the inscription of which forbade every Gentile from farther advance (Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell</span>. v. 5. 2, vi. 2. 4; <span class="ital">Antt.</span> viii. 3. 2 f., xv. 11. 5, <span class="ital">al.</span>; <span class="ital">Middoth</span>, ii. 3).

Other references, still more foreign to the matter, which have been introduced, such as to the Jewish districts in large towns, which were marked off by a wall or otherwise (Schöttgen and others), may be seen in Wolf.

As most commentators notice, the emphasis is on the <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>—“He and no other”. But there is probably more in it than that. The selection of the abstract <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>, instead of the simple <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιός</span>, suggests that the point of the <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> is not only “He <span class="ital">alone</span>,” but “He <span class="ital">in His own person</span>”. It is not only that the peace was made <span class="ital">by</span> Christ and ranks as His achievement, but that it is so identified with Him that were He away it would also fail,—so dependent on Him that apart from Him we cannot have it. And He is thus for us “<span class="ital">the</span> Peace” (<span class="greekheb">ἡ εἰρήνη</span>), Peace in the absolute sense to the exclusion of all other. <span class="ital">Peace</span>, the peace of the Messianic age, the peace that is to come by Messiah, is a frequent note in OT prophecy (<a href="/context/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire....">Isaiah 9:5-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>; <a href="/micah/5-5.htm" title="And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.">Micah 5:5</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm" title="The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a>). Here, as the next sentence shows, the peace especially in view is that between Jew and Gentile,—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ποιήσας τὰ ἀμφότερα ἕν</span>: <span class="ital">who made both one</span>. Not “hath made,” but “made,” with reference to the definite act of His death, as suggested by the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αἵματι</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἀμφότερα</span> is the abstract neuter—the two <span class="ital">parties</span> or classes. The sing. neut. <span class="greekheb">ἕν</span> (= one <span class="ital">thing</span>, one <span class="ital">organism</span>) expresses the idea of the <span class="ital">unity</span>, the new unity which the two long separate and antagonistic parties became; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἕν</span> used even of the relation between Christ and God in <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>, and for the unity here in view, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ μεσότοιχον τοῦ φραγμοῦ λύσας</span>: <span class="ital">and broke down the middle wall of the partition</span>. The former clause began the explanation of how Christ became our Peace. That explanation is continued in this clause and in the following. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, therefore, is epexegetic = <span class="ital">to wit</span>, or <span class="ital">in that</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 545). The gen. <span class="greekheb">φραγμοῦ</span> is not a mere equivalent to an adject. or a partic., as if = <span class="greekheb">τὸ μεσότοιχον διαφράσσον</span> (Grot., Rosenm., etc.), nor is it the gen. of <span class="ital">quality</span>, = “the middle wall whose character it is to divide”; but either (<span class="ital">a</span>) the <span class="ital">appos.</span> gen. or gen. of <span class="ital">identity</span>, = “the middle wall that is (or, consists in) the partition,” or (<span class="ital">b</span>) the <span class="ital">posses</span>. gen., = “the wall pertaining to the partition”. On the <span class="ital">latter</span> view of the gen. the <span class="greekheb">μεσότοιχον</span> (a word found only this once in the NT and of rare occurrence elsewhere) becomes the more definite and specific term, the <span class="greekheb">φραγμός</span> the more general, the former being, indeed, a part of the latter. That is to say, the <span class="greekheb">φραγμός</span> is the whole system of things that kept Jew and Gentile apart, and the <span class="greekheb">μεσότοιχον</span> is the thing in the system that most conspicuously divided them, and that constituted the “enmity,” <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the Law. It is best, however, to take the terms <span class="greekheb">μεσότοιχον</span> and <span class="greekheb">φραγμός</span> in the simple, literal sense of <span class="ital">division</span> and <span class="ital">separation</span>, which are not explained to be the Law till the <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> is actually introduced in the subsequent clause; and, therefore, the <span class="ital">former</span> view of the gen. appears to be preferable. It is suggested that what Paul really expresses then is the fact that the legal system, which was meant primarily to protect the Jewish people against the corruption of heathen idolatry, became the bitter root of Jewish exclusiveness in relation to the Gentiles. This is to give the <span class="greekheb">φραγμός</span> here the sense of something that fences <span class="ital">in</span> or <span class="ital">encloses</span>, which it occasionally has (Soph., <span class="ital">Œd. Tyr.</span>, 1387). But that is a rare sense, and the idea seems to be simpler. It is doubtful, too, whether Paul had in view here any material partition with which he was familiar. It could scarcely be the veil of the Temple that was rent at the Crucifixion; for that veil did not serve to separate the Gentile from the Jew. It might rather be (as Anselm, Bengel, and many more have thought) the wall or screen that divided the court of the Gentiles from the sanctuary proper, and of which Josephus tells us that it bore an inscription forbidding any Gentile from penetrating further (<span class="ital">Jew. Wars</span>, v., 5, 2; vi., 2, 4; <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, viii., 3, 2; xv., 11, 5). But even this is questionable, and all the more so as the wall was still standing at the time when this was written. For the use of <span class="greekheb">λύσας</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">he is our peace</span>] “<span class="ital">He:</span>”—the glorious living Person gives its essence to the sacrificial Work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Our peace:</span>”—i.e., as the connexion indicates, the “peace” between the Tribes of the New Israel, the Gentile and Jewish believers; such peace that now, within the covenant, “there is neither Jew nor Greek” (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>). The special aspect of this truth here is the admission of the non-Jewish believer to the inmost fulness of spiritual privilege; but this is so stated as to imply the tender companion truth that he comes in not as a conquering intruder but as a brother, side by side with the Jewish believer, in equal and harmonious peace with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who hath made both one</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">Who made both things one thing</span>. “Both” and “one” are neuters in the Gr.

(By the same word is expressed the Unity of the Father and the Son, <a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>.) In <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a> (“ye are all one”) the Gr. has the masculine, “one [person],” “one [<span class="ital">man</span>],” as expressly in the next verse here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath broken down … partition</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">did undo the mid-wall of the fence</span>, or <span class="bld">hedge</span>. The next verse makes it clear that this means the Law. In Divine intention the Law was a “hedge” (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>) round the Old Israel, so long as their chief function was to maintain a position of seclusion.
