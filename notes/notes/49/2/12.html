That condition is first summed up in one expression. They were “separate from Christ.” Then from this are drawn two gloomy consequences: first (1), that they had no part in God’s special covenant, “alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,” and so “strangers to the (often repeated) covenants of the promise” of the Messiah; next (2), that, thus left in “the world,” they had “no hope” of spiritual life and immortality, and were “godless” in thought and act. For Christ is at once the end and substance of the covenant of Israel, and the Revealer of God, and therefore of spiritual life in man, to all mankind. To be without Him is to lose both covenant and light. On (1) it is to be noted that the word used is not “aliens,” but “alienated.” implying—what is again and again declared to us—that the covenant with Israel, as it was held in trust for the blessing of “all families of the earth,” so also was simply the true birthright of humanity, from which mankind had fallen. The first “covenant” in scripture (<a href="/context/genesis/9-8.htm" title="And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,">Genesis 9:8-17</a>) is with the whole of the post-diluvian race, and is expressly connected with the reality of “the image of God” in man (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>). The succeeding covenants (as with Abraham, Moses, and David) all contain a promise concerning the whole race of man. Hence the Gentiles (as the utterances of prophecy showed more and more clearly while the ages rolled on) were exiles from what should have been their home; and their call into the Church of Christ was a restoration of God’s wandering children. In relation to (2) it is impossible not to observe, even in the highest forms of heathen philosophy, how their comparative “godlessness”—the absence of any clear notion of a real spiritual tie of nature between God and man—made their “hope” of life and immortality, though still cherished, shadowy and uncertain, always stronger in itself than in its grounds. But St. Paul’s description ought to be applied strictly, not to heathen life in its nobler and purer forms, but to the heathen life of Asia Minor in his days. What that was in moral degradation and in loss of all spiritual religion, ill compensated by the inevitable proneness to various superstitions, all contemporary literature testifies. From it came, as the Romans declared, the corruption which overspread the whole empire, and which St. Paul describes so terribly in <a href="/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18-32</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:11-13 Christ and his covenant are the foundation of all the Christian's hopes. A sad and terrible description is here; but who is able to remove himself out of it? Would that this were not a true description of many baptized in the name of Christ. Who can, without trembling, reflect upon the misery of a person, separated for ever from the people of God, cut off from the body of Christ, fallen from the covenant of promise, having no hope, no Saviour, and without any God but a God of vengeance, to all eternity? To have no part in Christ! What true Christian can hear this without horror? Salvation is far from the wicked; but God is a help at hand to his people; and this is by the sufferings and death of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye were without Christ - You were without the knowledge of the Messiah. You had not heard of him; of course you had not embraced him. You were living without any of the hopes and consolations which you now have, from having embraced him. The object of the apostle is to remind them of the deplorable condition in which they were by nature; and nothing would better express it than to say they were "without Christ," or that they had no knowledge of a Saviour. They knew of no atonement for sin. They had no assurance of pardon. They had no well-founded hope of eternal life. They were in a state of darkness and condemnation, from which nothing but a knowledge of Christ could deliver them. All Christians may in like manner be reminded of the fact that, before their conversion, they were "without Christ." Though they had heard of him, and were constantly under the instruction which reminded them of him, yet they were without any true knowledge of him, and without any of the hopes which result from having embraced him. Many were infidels. Many were scoffers. Many were profane, sensual, corrupt. Many rejected Christ with scorn; many, by simple neglect. All were without any true knowledge of him; all were destitute of the peace and hope which result from a saving acquaintance with him. We may add, that there is no more affecting description of the state of man by nature than to say, he is without a Saviour. Sad would be the condition of the world without a Redeemer - sad is the state of that portion of mankind who reject him. Reader, are you without Christ?<p>Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel - This is the second characteristic of their state before their conversion to Christianity. This means more than that they were not Jews. It means that they were strangers to that "polity" - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  politeia - or arrangement by which the worship of the true God had been kept up in the world, and of course were strangers to the true religion The arrangements for the public worship of Yahweh were made among the Jews. They had his law, his temple, his sabbaths, and the ordinances of his religion; see the notes at <a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. To all these the pagans had been strangers, and of course they were deprived of all the privileges which resulted from having the true religion. The word rendered here as "commonwealth" - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  politeia - means properly citizenship, or the right of citizenship, and then a community, or state. It means here that arrangement or organization by which the worship of the true God was maintained. The word "aliens" -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  ape&#772;llotrio&#772;menoi - here means merely that they were strangers to. It does not denote, of necessity, that they were hostile to it; but that they were ignorant of it, and were, therefore, deprived of the benefits which they might have derived from it, if they had been acquainted with it.<p>And strangers - This word - &#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  xenos - means properly a guest, or a stranger, who is hospitably entertained; then a foreigner, or one from a distant country; and here means that they did not belong to the community where the covenants of promise were enjoyed; that is, they were strangers to the privileges of the people of God.<p>The covenants of promise - see the notes at <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>. The covenants of promise were those various arrangements which God made with his people, by which he promised them future blessings, and especially by which he promised that the Messiah should come. To be in possession of them was regarded as a high honor and privilege; and Paul refers to it here to show that, though the Ephesians had been by nature without these, yet they had now been brought to enjoy all the benefits of them. On the word covenant, see the notes on <a href="/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>. It may be remarked, that Walton (Polyglott) and Rosenmuller unite the word "promise" here with the word "hope" - "having no hope of the promise." But the more obvious and usual interpretation is that in our common version, meaning that they were not by nature favored with the covenants made with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., by which there was a promise of future blessings under the Messiah.<p>Having no hope - The apostle does not mean to affirm that they did not cherish any hope, for this is scarcely true of any man; but that they were without any proper ground of hope. It is true of perhaps nearly all people that they cherish some hope of future happiness. But the ground on which they do this is not well understood by themselves, nor do they in general regard it as a matter worth particular inquiry. Some rely on morality; some on forms of religion; some on the doctrine of universal salvation; all who are impenitent believe that they do not "deserve" eternal death, and expect to be saved by "justice." Such hopes, however, must be unfounded. No hope of life in a future world can be founded on a proper basis which does not rest on some promise of God, or some assurance that he will save us; and these hopes, therefore, which people take up they know not why, are delusive and vain.<p>And without God in the world - Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  atheoi - "atheists;" that is, those who had no knowledge of the true God. This is the last specification of their miserable condition before they were converted; and it is an appropriate crowning of the climax. What an expression! To be without God - without God in his own world, and where he is all around us! To have no evidence of his favor, no assurance of his love, no hope of dwelling with him! The meaning, as applied to the pagan Ephesians, was, that they had no knowledge of the true God. This was true of the pagan, and in an important sense also it is true of all impenitent sinners, and was once true of all who are now Christians. They had no God. They did not worship him, or love him, or serve him, or seek his favors, or act with reference to him and his glory. Nothing can be a more appropriate and striking description of a sinner now than to say that he is "without God in the world."<p>He lives, and feels, and acts, as if there were no God. He neither worships him in secret, nor in his family, nor in public. He acts with no reference to his will. He puts no confidence in his promises, and fears not when he threatens; and were it announced to him that there "is no God," it would produce no change in his plan of life, or in his emotions. The announcement that the emperor of China, or the king of Siam, or the sultan of Constantinople, was dead, would produce some emotion, and might change some of his commercial arrangements; but the announcement that there is no God would interfere with none of his plans, and demand no change of life. And, if so, what is man in this beautiful world without a God? A traveler to eternity without a God! Standing over the grave without a God! An immortal being without a God! A man - fallen, sunk, ruined, with no God to praise, to love, to confide in; with no altar, no sacrifice, no worship, no hope; with no Father in trial, no counselor in perplexity, no support in death! Such is the state of man by nature. Such are the effects of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. without Christ&#8212;Greek, "separate from Christ"; having no part in Him; far from Him. A different Greek word (aneu) would be required to express, "Christ was not present with you" [Tittmann].<p>aliens&#8212;Greek, "alienated from," not merely "separated from." The Israelites were cut off from the commonwealth of God, but it was as being self-righteous, indolent, and unworthy, not as aliens and strangers [Chrysostom]. The expression, "alienated from," takes it for granted that the Gentiles, before they had apostatized from the primitive truth, had been sharers in light and life (compare Eph 4:18, 23). The hope of redemption through the Messiah, on their subsequent apostasy, was embodied into a definite "commonwealth" or polity, namely, that "of Israel," from which the Gentiles were alienated. Contrast Eph 2:13; Eph 3:6; 4:4, 5, with Ps 147:20.<p>covenants of promise&#8212;rather, "&#8230; of the promise," namely, "to thee and thy seed will I give this land" (Ro 9:4; Ga 3:16). The plural implies the several renewals of the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and with the whole people at Sinai [Alford]. "The promise" is singular, to signify that the covenant, in reality, and substantially, is one and the same at all times, but only different in its accidents and external circumstances (compare Heb 1:1, "at sundry times and in divers manners").<p>having no &#8230; hope&#8212;beyond this life (1Co 15:19). The CONJECTURES of heathen philosophers as to a future life were at best vague and utterly unsatisfactory. They had no divine "promise," and therefore no sure ground of "hope." Epicurus and Aristotle did not believe in it at all. The Platonists believed the soul passed through perpetual changes, now happy, and then again miserable; the Stoics, that it existed no longer than till the time of the general burning up of all things.<p>without God&#8212;Greek, "atheists," that is, they had not "God" in the sense we use the word, the Eternal Being who made and governs all things (compare Ac 14:15, "Turn from these vanities unto the living God who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things therein"), whereas the Jews had distinct ideas of God and immortality. Compare also Ga 4:8, "Ye knew not God &#8230; ye did service unto them which are no gods" (1Th 4:5). So also pantheists are atheists, for an impersonal God is NO God, and an ideal immortality no immortality [Tholuck].<p>in the world&#8212;in contrast to belonging to "the commonwealth of Israel." Having their portion and their all in this godless vain world (Ps 17:14), from which Christ delivers His people (Joh 15:19; 17:14; Ga 1:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That at that time ye were without Christ; </span> i.e. without knowledge of him, or interest in him.

Or separate from him: they were chosen in him and were preserved in him, and were redeemed by him before; but they were without any knowledge of him, faith in him, love to him, communion with him, or subjection to him, his Gospel, government, laws, and ordinances; and particularly they were without any promises of him, or prophecies concerning him, which were peculiar to the Jews; hence the Messiah is called , "the Christ of Israel" (w), and who as he was promised, so he was sent only to the lost sheep of the house, of Israel: hence it follows, <p>being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; both from their civil and church state; the Gentiles might not dwell among them, nor have any dealings with them in things civil, unless they conformed to certain laws; nor might the Jews go into any, nor eat or converse with any, that were uncircumcised; so great an alienation and distance were there between these two people; and much less might they eat the passover and join with them in religious worship; the word for "commonwealth" here used, Harpocratian says (x), is commonly used by Greek writers for a "democracy" though the original constitution of the Israelites was properly a "theocracy": <p>strangers to the covenants of promise; to the covenant of circumcision given to Abraham; and to the covenant at Mount Sinai, made with Israel; and to the dispensation of the covenant of grace to that people, sometimes called the first covenant and the old covenant, and which peculiarly belonged to them, <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a> one copy reads, "strangers to the promises of the covenant"; which is natural enough; the Vulgate Latin version joins the word "promise" to the next clause, and reads, <p>having no hope of the promise of the promised Messiah: "having no hope"; of the Messiah and salvation by him, of the resurrection of the dead, of a future state, and of eternal life; none that is sure and steadfast, that is purifying, and makes not ashamed; or which is a good hope through grace, is the gift of God, the fruit of his love, and the effect of his power; and this is to be in a miserable condition: Philo, the Jew (y), observes, that <p>"the Chaldeans call a man Enos, as if he only was truly a man that expects good things, and supports himself with good hopes; and adds, hence it is manifest that one without hope is not reckoned a man, but a beast in an human form; since he is destitute of hope, which is the property of the human soul;'' <p>and without God in the world; without the knowledge of God in Christ; without the image of God, which was defaced by sin; without the grace and fear of God; and without communion with him, and the worship of him; and while they were so they were in the world, among the men of it, and were a part of it, not being yet called out of it: the word signifies "atheists": so some of the Gentiles were in "theory", as they all were in practice; and they were by the Jews reckoned no other than "atheists"; it is a common saying with them (z) that <p>"he that dwells without the land (of Israel) is like one  , "who has no God":'' <p>(w) Targum in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16.htm">Isaiah 16</a>.1. 5.

The sentence interrupted by the description of those addressed as <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is now resumed—<span class="ital">Remember, I say, that ye were</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τῷ καιρῷ</span>, corresponding to the previous <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span>, refers to their pre-Christian days. In such phrases it is usual to insert <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> (Donald., <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, p. 487), and it is inserted by the TR (following [149] [150] [151] [152], etc.). But time <span class="ital">when</span> is also often enough expressed by the simple dat. (Win.-Moult., pp. 273, 274), and the balance of evidence is largely against the presence of the prep. here. The <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς Χριστοῦ</span> is the predicate to <span class="greekheb">ἦτε</span>, and is not a defining clause = “being at that time without Christ” (De Wette, Bleek). It describes their former condition as one in which they had no connection with Christ; in which respect they were in a position sadly inferior to that of the Jews whose attitude was one of hoping and waiting for Christ, the Messiah. Their apartness from Christ, their lack of all relation to Him—this is the first stroke in the dark picture of their former heathen life, and the four to which the eye is directed in the subsequent clauses all follow from that.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι τῆς πολιτείας τοῦ Ἰσραήλ</span>: <span class="ital">alienated from the commonwealth of Israel</span>. The <span class="ital">alienation</span> is expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀπαλλοτριοῦσθαι</span>, a strong verb, common enough in classical Greek (at least from Plato’s time), corresponding to the OT <span class="greekheb">זוּר</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/psalms/58-4.htm" title="Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear;">Psalm 58:4</a>), and used again in <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. It does not necessarily imply a lapse from a former condition of attachment or fellowship, but expresses generally the idea of being a <span class="ital">stranger</span> as contrasted with one who is <span class="ital">at home</span> with a person or an object. The term <span class="greekheb">πολιτεία</span> has two main senses—a <span class="ital">state</span> or <span class="ital">commonwealth</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-11.htm" title="And the royal privileges granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down the governments which were according to the law, he brought up new customs against the law:">2Ma 4:11</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-17.htm" title="And to set before their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of their forefathers:">2Ma 8:17</a>), and <span class="ital">citizenship</span> or the rights of a citizen (<a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>). The first of these is most in harmony with the theocratic term <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Ἰσραήλ</span>, and so it is understood by most. These Ephesians, therefore, had no part in the theocracy, the OT constitution under which God made Himself known to the Jew and entered into relation with him.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ξένοι τῶν διαθηκῶν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας</span>: <span class="ital">and strangers from the covenants of the Promise</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τῶν διαθηκῶν</span> is probably the gen. of <span class="ital">separation</span> or <span class="ital">removal</span>. That idea is usually expressed by a prep., but with verbs like <span class="greekheb">ὑποχωρεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διαφέρειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποστερεῖσθαι</span>, and with some adjectives, it is also expressed by the simple gen. (Win.-Moult., pp. 243, 244). The word <span class="greekheb">ξένος</span>, which has the particular meaning of one who is not a member of a state or city, is used here in the general sense of <span class="ital">foreign</span> to a thing, having no share in it. The <span class="greekheb">διαθῆκαι</span> are the covenants with Abraham and the patriarchs (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-22.htm" title="So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, nor force of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.">Wis 18:22</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-15.htm" title="And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name's sake, by which they were called.">2Ma 8:15</a>). It is obviously the covenants of Messianic significance that are in view. That the Mosaic Law or the Sinaitic Covenant is not in view seems to follow from the mention of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span>; for that Covenant was not distinctively of the Promise, but is described by Paul as coming in after it and provisionally (<a href="/context/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect....">Galatians 3:17-19</a>). The <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span> is the Promise, the one distinctively so called, the great Messianic Promise given to the fathers of the Hebrew people (<a href="/genesis/13-15.htm" title="For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm" title="And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.">Genesis 17:8</a>, etc.). The defining <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπαγγελίας</span> is attached by some (Rosenmüller, etc.) to the following <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες</span>. But the <span class="ital">covenants</span> and the <span class="ital">promise</span> are kindred ideas, and make one thought here.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες</span>: <span class="ital">having no hope</span>. With participles the subjective negative is much more frequently used than <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>. In cases like the present, where the participle does not belong to the class of those expressing command, purpose, condition or the like, the use of <span class="greekheb">μή</span> is due to the <span class="ital">aspect</span> in which the matter in question presents itself to the writer—to the fact, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, that he has a <span class="ital">genus</span>, not the individual, in view; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ell. on <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, and Win.-Moult., p. 606. The statement here is absolute—<span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδα</span>, not <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐλπίδα</span>. It is not only that they had not <span class="ital">the</span> hope, the Messianic hope which was one of the distinctions of the Israelite, but that they were utterly without hope. Ignorant of the Divine salvation and of Christ in whom it was found, they had nothing to hope for beyond this world.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἄθεοι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>: <span class="ital">and without God in the world</span>. The last element in the darkness and misery of their former life. The adj. <span class="greekheb">ἄθεος</span>, which is never found in the LXX or in the Apocrypha, and only this once in the NT, in classical Greek means <span class="ital">impious</span> in the sense of denying or neglecting the gods of the State; but it is also used occasionally in the sense of <span class="ital">knowing</span> or <span class="ital">worshipping no God</span> (Æl., V. h., 2, 31), or in that of <span class="ital">abandoned by God</span> (Soph., <span class="ital">Œd. R.</span>, 633). Three renderings are possible here—<span class="ital">ignorant</span> of God, <span class="ital">denying</span> God, <span class="ital">forsaken</span> of God. The third is preferred by many (Mey., Ell., etc.), who think that the darkest colour is given to the picture of their old heathen condition by this mention of the fact that they were without the help and protection of God. The first of the three senses, however, seems even more in harmony with the preceding negations. As they were without Christ, and without hope, so were they without God—without the knowledge of the one true and living and thus destitute of any God. So in <a href="/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a> Paul speaks of Gentiles like these as <span class="ital">knowing</span> not God and doing service unto them <span class="ital">which by nature are no gods</span>. The clause <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span> is connected by some with the whole preceding description (Koppe, etc.); by others with the two last sentences in the description—the <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἄθεοι</span> (Abb.). But it rather makes one idea with the immediately preceding term <span class="greekheb">ἄθεοι</span>. It is difficult to say in what particular sense the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is used here—whether in the simple, non-ethical sense, or in the deeper sense which it has in John and also at times in some degree in Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). Whichever is preferred—whether “without God in the world of men,” or “without God in this <span class="ital">evil</span> world”—an appropriate idea results. But the implied contrast with the previous <span class="greekheb">πολιτεία τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ</span> leads most to decide for the latter. The domain of their life was this present evil world, and in it, alienated as it was from God, they had no God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[149] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

The Gr. word habitually marks <span class="ital">limited</span> periods; though this must not always be pressed.

Here no Pharisaic prejudice is in view, but the mysterious fact that <span class="ital">only</span> through the great prophesied Redeemer is there life and acceptance for man, and that in order to contact with Him there needs “preaching,” “hearing,” “believing” (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm" title="For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.">Romans 10:13</a>; <a href="/romans/10-15.htm" title="And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!">Romans 10:15</a>). Scripture does not present this fact without any relief; but all relief leaves it a phenomenon of Revelation as mysterious as it is solid.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being aliens</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">having been alienated</span> (the same word as <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>); as if they had once been otherwise. So, in idea, they had been. Every human soul is (occasionally) viewed in Scripture as having been originally unfallen, and, if unfallen, then in a covenant of peace with God of which the covenant of Israel was but a type. Such a view is wholly ideal, referring not to the actual history of the individual soul, but to the Nature of which the individual is a specimen. Such popular phrases as, “we are <span class="ital">fallen</span> creatures,” have this truth below them. Historically, we <span class="ital">begin prostrate;</span> ideally, we <span class="ital">began upright</span>, and have fallen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the commonwealth of Israel</span>] Perhaps, “<span class="ital">the citizenship</span>.” The Gr. word occurs elsewhere, in N. T., <a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a> only (A. V., “this <span class="ital">freedom;</span>” the Roman citizenship). But the A. V. here (and so R. V.) is favoured by the word “<span class="ital">alienated</span>.” It is rather more natural to say “made aliens from a <span class="ital">state</span>,” than “made aliens from <span class="ital">state-rights</span>.” The two interpretations, however, perfectly coincide practically. “<span class="ital">Israel</span>,” (the Covenant-People with its special name of sacred dignity; see Trench, <span class="ital">N. T.</span> <span class="ital">Synonyms</span>, § 39;) is viewed as an ordered commonwealth or empire under its Divine King; and to be free of its rights is the one way to have connexion with Him.—By “Israel” the Apostle here doubtless means the inner Israel, of which the outer was as it were the husk; see <a href="/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:">Romans 9:6</a>. But he does not emphasize a distinction. Under the Old Covenant, it was generally necessary to belong, in some sense, to the outer Israel in order to be one of the inner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strangers</span>] The Gr. is a word familiar in <span class="ital">civic</span> connexions; non-members of a state or city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the covenants of promise</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">of the Promise</span>, the great Promise of Messiah, according to which those who “are of the Messiah, are Abraham’s seed, and heirs by promise” (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>). In the light of <a href="/galatians/3-18.htm" title="For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.">Galatians 3:18</a>, we may say that the Promise is more specially of Justification, Acceptance, (as in Abraham’s case,) through faith, securing vital connexion with the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Covenants:</span>”—for the plural cp. <a href="/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>. The reference is to the <span class="ital">many</span> Compacts, as with Abraham, Moses, Levi, David, Joshua; and <span class="ital">perhaps</span> to the New Covenant itself, as of course “connected with” the Promise.—The Promise indicated, from the first, blessings for the world, “all the families of the earth”; but these blessings were to be found only “in Abraham and his seed” (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>); and thus to those not yet connected with Abraham and the Messiah there was no actual portion yet in the “covenants.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having no hope</span>] The Gr. just indicates (by its special negative particle) that this was not only so, but felt by the Gentiles to be so; “having, <span class="ital">as you knew</span>, no hope.” (So, precisely, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>.) The deep truth of this is fully attested by classical and other heathen literature, old or modern. Aspiration and conjecture there often was, but <span class="ital">no hope</span>, in the Scripture sense; no expectation on a firm basis. A profound uncertainty about the unseen and eternal underlies many of the strongest expressions of the classical poets and philosophers. And in the special reference of “hope” here, hope of a Redeemer and a redeemed inheritance, there was (and is) a total blank, apart from revelation.—“In Hellas, at the epoch of Alexander the Great, it was a current saying, and one profoundly felt by all the best men, that the best thing of all was not to be born, and the next best to die.” (Mommsen, <span class="ital">Hist. of Rome</span>, Eng. transl. Vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 586). See the thought still earlier, Sophocles, <span class="ital">Œd</span>. <span class="ital">Col</span>. 1224 (Dindorf).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without God</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">Godless</span>; without true knowledge of the true God. “Gods many” were indeed, in some sense, popularly believed in; and large schools of thought recognized a One Supreme, though often with the very faintest views of personality. But this recognition, at its best and highest, lacked some <span class="ital">essentials</span> in the Idea of the True God, above all, the union in Him of supreme Love and awful Purity. And for the average mind of ancient heathenism He “was not, in all the thoughts,” as truly as the impersonal Brahm “is not” in the average Hindoo mind. See further, Appendix D.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the world</span>] Words which complete the dark picture. “In the world” of fallen humanity, with its dreadful realities of evil, they did not “know the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom He had sent” (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), and so lacked the one possible preservative and spiritual life-power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>D. “WITHOUT GOD.” (Ch. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The vulgar believed in many Gods, the philosopher believed in a Universal Cause; but neither believed in God.

Theism was discussed as a philosophical not as a religious question, … as no more affecting practice than any great scientific hypothesis does now … Nothing would have astonished [the philosopher] more than, when he had proved in his lecture hall the existence of a God, to have been told to worship Him. ‘Worship whom?’ he would have exclaimed, ‘worship what? worship how?’ ”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mozley, <span class="ital">Lectures on Miracles</span>, Lect. iv.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) On this word, <span class="ital">you were</span> [<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>], and <span class="ital">you are made</span> [<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>], depend; but the particle is repeated from <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">χωρὶς</span>, <span class="ital">without</span>) The antithesis is <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>.
