The Ephesians are said to be, not a part of the habitation of God, but themselves built into Christ for an habitation of God—“Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith,” and they “therefore being filled with all the fulness of God” (<a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>). The addition of this clause, therefore, links the teaching of this Epistle with the earlier and more individual forms of teaching, noted on <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>.<p>This verse contains, again, the declaration (as in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) of the union of Christians with each Person of THE HOLY TRINITY. The soul made one with THE SON becomes a temple for the indwelling of THE FATHER in the gift of THE HOLY SPIRIT. (See <a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-22 The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of it. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church is also compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ; delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of God through the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopes are fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have we devoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are we habitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grieve the holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and his influences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the duties allotted to us, to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom - In Christ, or on Christ, as the solid and precious foundation.<p>Ye also are builded together - You are built into that, or constitute a part of it. You are not merely "added" to it, but you constitute a part of the building.<p>For an habitation of God - For the indwelling, or the dwelling-place, of God. Formerly he dwelt in the temple. Now he dwells in the church, and in the hearts of his people; see the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a><p>1. We were by nature dead in sin; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>. We had no spiritual life. We were insensible to the calls of God, to the beauty of religion, to the claims of the Creator. We were like corpses in the tomb in reference to the frivolous and busy and happy world around them. There we should have remained, had not the grace of God given us life, just as the dead will remain in their graves forever, unless God shall raise them up. How humble should we be at the remembrance of this fact! how grateful that God bas not left us to sleep that sleep of death forever!<p>2. Parents should feel deep solicitude for their children; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>. They, in common with all others, are "children of wrath." They have a nature prone to evil; and that nature will develope itself in evil for ever, unless it is changed - just as the young thornbush will be a thorn-bush, and will put forth thorns and not roses; and the Bohon Upas will be a Bohon Upas, and not an olive or an orange; and as the lion will be a lion, and the panther a panther, and not a lamb, a kid, or a gazelle. They will act out their nature, unless they are changed: and they will not be changed, but by the grace of God. I do not mean that their nature is in every sense like that of the lion or the asp; but I mean that they will be as certainly "wicked," if unrenewed, as the lion will be ferocious, and the asp poisonous. And if so, what deep anxiety should parents feel for the salvation of their children! How solicitous should they be that, by the grace of God. the evil propensities of their nature may be eradicated, and that they become the adopted children of God!<p>3. The salvation of sinners involves all the exercise of power that is put forth in the resurrection of the dead; <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>. It is not a work to be performed by man; it is not a work of angelic might. None can impart spiritual life to the soul but he who gave it life at first. On that great Source of life we are dependent for our resurrection from spiritual death; and to God we must look for the grace by which we are to live. It is true that though we are by nature "dead in sins," we are not in all respects like the dead. Let not this doctrine be abused to make us secure in sin, or to prevent effort. The dead in the grave are dead in all respects. We by nature are dead only in sin. We are active in other things; and indeed the powers of man are not less active than they would be if he were holy. But it is a tremendous activity for evil, and for evil only. The dead in their graves hear nothing, see nothing, and feel nothing.<p>Sinners hear, and see, and feel; but they hear not God, and they see not his glory, anymore than if they were dead. To the dead in the grave, no command could with propriety be addressed; on them, no entreaty could be urged to rise to life. But the sinner may be commanded and entreated; for he has power, though it is misdirected; and what is needful is, that he should put forth his power in a proper manner. While, therefore, we admit, with deep humiliation, that we, our children, and friends, are by nature dead in sin, let us not abuse this doctrine as though we could be required to do nothing. It is with us willful death. It is death because we do not choose to live. It is a voluntary closing our eyes, and stopping our ears, as if we were dead; and it is a voluntary remaining in this state, when we have all the requisite power to put forth the energies of life. Let a sinner be as active in the service of God as he is in the service of the devil and the world, and he would be an eminent Christian. Indeed, all that is required is, that the misdirected and abused energy of this world should be employed in the service of the Creator. Then all would be well.<p>(See the supplementary notes, <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>, note. Whenever it is said the sinner has power, the kind of power should be defined. Certainly he has not moral power. This, indeed, the author allows, but for want of distinct definition of what he understands by "power," both here and elsewhere, the reader is apt to misapprehend him.)<p>4. Let us remember our former course of life; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-12</a>. Nothing is more profitable for a Christian than to sit down and reflect on his former life - on his childhood, with its numerous follies and vanities; on his youth, with its errors, and passions, and sins: and on the ingratitude and faults of riper years. Had God left us in that state, what would be now our condition? Had he cut us off, where had been our abode? Should he now treat us as we deserve, what would be our doom? When the Christian is in danger of becoming proud and self-confident, let him remember what he was. Let him take some period of his life - some year, some month, or even some one day - and think it all over, and he will find enough to humble him. These are the uses which should be made of the past:<p>(1) It should make us humble. If a man had before his mind a vivid sense of all the past in his own life, he would never be lifted up with pride.<p>(2) it should make us grateful. God cut off the companions of my childhood - why did he spare me? He cut down many of the associates of my youth in their sins - why did he preserve me? He has suffered many to live on in their sins, and they are in the "broad road" - why am I not with them, treading the path to death and hell?<p>(3) the recollection of the past should lead us to devote ourselves to God. Professing Christian, "remember" how much of thy life is gone to waste. "Remember" thy days of folly and vanity. "Remember" the injury thou hast done by an evil example. "Remember" how many have been corrupted by thy conversation; perverted by thy opinions; led into sin by thy example; perhaps ruined in body and soul forever by the errors and follies of thy past life. And then remember how much thou dost owe to God, and how solemnly thou art bound to endeavor to repair the evils of thy life, and to save "at least as many as" thou hast ruined.<p>5. Sinners are by nature without any well-founded hope of salvation; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>, They are living without Christ, having no belief in him, and no hope of salvation through him. They are "aliens" from all the privileges of the friends of God. They have no "hope." They have no wellfounded expectation of happiness beyond the grave. They have a dim and shadowy expectation that "possibly" they may be happy; but it is founded on no evidence of the divine favor, and no promise of God. "They could not tell on what it is founded, if they were asked;" and what is such a hope worth? These false and delusive hopes do not sustain the soul in trial; they flee away in death. And what a description is this! In a world like this, to be without hope! Subject to trial; exposed to death; and yet destitute of any well-founded prospect of happiness beyond the tomb! They are "without God" also. They worship no God: they confide in none.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. are builded together&#8212;Translate, "are being builded together."<p>through&#8212;Greek, "in the Spirit."

As the church universal, so every particular church is a building that is compact together, in and upon Christ, as the church at Ephesus was: God is the builder of it; Christ is the foundation; true believers are the proper materials; the door, or entrance into it, is Christ, and faith in him; the ministers of the Gospel are pillars in it; the ordinances are its windows; its furniture is of various sorts, there are vessels of small, and of great quantity; and its provisions are large and entertaining. A church is a building compact together; it consists of many parts; and these are joined together, by agreement, and are knit and cemented in love; and being thus joined together, they are designed for social worship, and their great concern should be to edify one another. The phrase, "in whom", may either refer to the holy temple before spoken of, the church universal, of which a particular church is a part; or to Christ, who is the master builder, by whom they are built together, and the foundation on whom they are built, and the cornerstone in whom they meet and are united. And the end of their being thus built together is, for an habitation of God through the Spirit; which may be understood of God the Father, since he is distinguished from Christ, in whom, and from the Holy Spirit, through whom, they are built for this purpose, though not to the exclusion of either of them; for a particular church is an habitation of Father, Son, and Spirit: and it being the habitation of God, shows his great grace and condescension, and the great value and regard he has for it; and this makes it a desirable, delightful, and pleasant habitation to the saints; and hence it is a safe and a quiet one, and they are happy that dwell in it; and hither should souls come for the enjoyment of the divine presence: and whereas it is said to be such through the Spirit; hence it appears, that the Spirit is concerned with the other two persons in the building of it; and that hereby it becomes a spiritual house; and is, through his grace, a fit habitation for the holy God to dwell in; and that God dwells in his churches by his Spirit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>] applies to <span class="greekheb">ἐν κυρίῳ</span>, and is to be explained quite like <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> in <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>. The reference to <span class="greekheb">ναόν</span> (Calixtus, Rosenmüller, Matthies) appears on account of the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐν κυρίῳ</span> arbitrary, and, according to the correct apprehension of <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα οἰκοδ</span>., as well as with regard to the following <span class="greekheb">εἰς κατοικητήριον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνοικοδομεῖσθε</span>] is indicative, not <span class="ital">imperative</span> (Calvin, Meier), against which <a href="/context/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;...">Ephesians 2:19-20</a> are decisive,[163] according to which Paul says not what the readers <span class="ital">ought to be</span>, but what they <span class="ital">are</span>; hence he, at <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>, attaches in symmetrical <span class="ital">relative</span> construction the relation of the readers to that which subsists in the case of <span class="ital">every</span> Christian community, <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>.

The latter is to be preferred, because the parallelism of <a href="/context/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:...">Ephesians 2:21-22</a> makes the attaching of different senses to the two compounds <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΑΡΜΟΛΟΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΟΙΚΟΔ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> appear groundless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΚΑΤΟΙΚΗΤΉΡΙΟΝ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">unto the dwelling of God</span>, quite the same, only with a variation of expression, as before <span class="greekheb">εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον</span> was (comp. <a href="/matthew/23-21.htm" title="And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it, and by him that dwells therein.">Matthew 23:21</a>), and pertaining to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΟΙΚΟΔ</span></span></span>.

How arbitrary generally in itself! how arbitrary, in particular, not to refer <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> to the <span class="ital">Holy</span> Spirit! since we have here, exactly as in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>, the juxtaposition of the Divine Trias, while the context presents nothing whatever to suggest the contrast with a temple of <span class="ital">stone</span>. Harless (comp. Meier and Matthies): “a dwelling, <span class="ital">which is in the indwelling of the Spirit</span>;” and this, forsooth! is held to mean: “<span class="ital">inasmuch as the Spirit dwells in them, they are a dwelling of God and of Christ</span>.” But, apart from the fact that of this “<span class="ital">and of Christ</span>” there is nothing whatever in the text, in this way <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>, which according to the literal sense could only be the <span class="ital">continens</span>, would in fact be made the <span class="ital">contentum!</span> From this the very analogies, in themselves inappropriate (because they are <span class="ital">abstracta</span>), which Harless employs: <span class="greekheb">χαρὰ ἐν πνεύματι</span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΆΠΗ ἘΝ ΠΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, ought to have precluded him. The true view is to connect it not merely with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΟΙΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, but with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΟΊΚΟΔΟΜΕῖΣΘΕ ΕἸς ΚΑΤΟΙΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> is <span class="ital">instrumental</span>. Ye are being builded together unto the dwelling-place of God <span class="ital">by virtue of the Holy Spirit</span>; in so far, namely, as the latter dwells in your Christian community (see on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a> f.; comp. <a href="/james/4-5.htm" title="Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?">Jam 4:5</a>), and thereby the relation of being the temple of God is brought about—a relation, which without this indwelling of the Spirit would not occur, and would not be possible. For the Spirit of God is related to the ideal temple as the <span class="ital">Shechinah</span> to the actual temple, and is the <span class="ital">conditio sine qua non</span> of the same. Comp. also Hofmann, who, however, likewise connects <span class="greekheb">ἐν πν</span>. only with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΟΙΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> The objections of Harless to the instrumental rendering of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> are not valid; for (<span class="ital">a</span>) the circumstance that <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> was placed only <span class="ital">at the end</span> not only very naturally resulted from the parallelism with <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>, seeing that in <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> there is not contained an element corresponding to the <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>, and consequently this new element is most naturally appended <span class="ital">at the end</span>, but the position at the close imparts also to the <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύμ</span>. an unusual emphasis (Kühner, II. p. 625), comp. also <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>; and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the suggestion that <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, as the objective medium, must have the article, is incorrect, seeing that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span>, with or without an article (in accordance with the nature of a proper noun), is the objective Holy Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[163] In and of itself the <span class="ital">relative</span> clause would not exclude the imperative (in opposition to Hofmann).

The relative refers again, as in <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>, to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, the <span class="greekheb">Κυρίῳ</span> just named, not to the <span class="greekheb">ναόν</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (= <span class="ital">also</span>, not <span class="ital">even</span>) points to the dignity of the present position—“the exalted nature of the association in which the Ephesians shared” (Ell.). The <span class="greekheb">συνοικοδομεῖσθε</span> is not imper. (Calv.), but indic., the burden of the whole section being what was done for the readers and what was made of them. The <span class="greekheb">συν</span>- in the comp. verb might convey the idea of being built together with others; but, in view of the force of the <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογουμένη</span> it is rather to be understood as denoting the compact connection of one part with another, the orderly conjunction and co-ordination of all the various parts of the <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> (Mey., Ell.); <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">συνέκλεισεν</span> in <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατοικητήριον</span> is best translated “habitation”. Some draw a distinction between the <span class="greekheb">ναόν</span> as the whole Church and the <span class="greekheb">κατοικητήριον</span> as the individual Christians (Harl.). But the latter phrase simply expresses in another form the same idea as the former. The <span class="greekheb">κατοικητήριον</span> being that <span class="ital">of God</span> (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>), belonging to Him, inhabited by Him, is the same as the <span class="greekheb">ναός</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> is not to be taken as = “in a spiritual manner,” as if in contrast with <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>; nor as making with the noun the idea of “a spiritual house”; but as = <span class="ital">in the Holy Spirit</span>, the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> having often that sense and the similar <span class="greekheb">ἐν Κυρίῳ</span> suggesting it. Nor should the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> be rendered “through” (AV) or “by” (Mey.). It is true that the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> use of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> gives a thoroughly good sense, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that we are built together in Christ by the agency of the Holy Spirit—in respect of His dwelling and operating in us. But the idea is rather that of <span class="ital">in</span> the Spirit as the <span class="ital">element</span> of the life or the <span class="ital">condition</span> of the process. The phrase may be connected immediately with the <span class="greekheb">κατοικητήριον</span> as if = “a habitation of God realised in the Spirit,” or it may be construed as a tertiary predication (Ell.) = “and it is in the Spirit”. But it is best taken to qualify the whole statement of the <span class="greekheb">συνοικοδομεῖσθε</span>, = “in Christ as the ground and principle of all ye too are being built together into a habitation of God, and it is by your being in the Spirit that this is taking effect”. Union with Christ, life in the Spirit—this explained what they were; this meant that they, as well as other Christian bodies, were being built up so as to be a habitation of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">you also</span>] He reminds them of the joyful fact that they are special examples of the general truth that “the Gentiles are fellow-heirs.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are builded</span>] A present tense in the Greek; <span class="bld">are building, being builded</span>.

The true idea is of the eternal Indwelling of God in the glorified Church. But this is reached through the lasting, though partial, Indwelling now. See notes above; and below, on <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God</span>] Not here specially Christ.

Meanwhile, again, the present is the germ of that Future; “My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him” (<a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>)[34]; and “ye are the temple of the living God” (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] The one passage where the coming of the Father is spoken of.

The living Temple, in its every stone, is what it is by the immediate action of the Holy Spirit, “Who sanctifieth the elect people of God.” They are thus “<span class="ital">in</span> the Spirit”(<a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>), surrounded, as it were, by His presence and power. And so it will be, as this passage indicates, in the final state where the “pure River” will still “proceed from the Throne of” the Father and the Son. Will not the Holy Spirit’s work, far from ceasing, be supremely effectual, in the world of “<span class="ital">spiritual bodies</span>” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

The person changes from the third to the second, to make emphatic that the Ephesians shared this great privilege. Their relations towards believing Jews and other believers in the Church were not accidental; they were "builded together," compacted into each other, and ought to work together towards God's great ends. <span class="cmt_word">For a habitation of God in the Spirit.</span> Not many habitations, but one. The Church as a temple is the dwelling-place of God. Here he bestows his fullness, so that when the temple is completed it will exhibit, as fully as a created thing can, the manifold glory of God. "In the Spirit" in this verse corresponds to "in the Lord" in the previous one. The actual communication of Divine properties to finite beings is the work of the Third Person. In this verse, again, we find the three Persons of the Trinity: the temple is the habitation of the First Person; the source of its life and growth and symmetry is the Son; the actual up-building and glorifying of it is by the Spirit. This is the climax of privilege, and no contrast could be greater than that between the death in trespasses and sins with which the chapter begins, and this sublime temple, where God dwells and bestows his fullness, with which it ends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are builded together (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>As component parts of the one building.
