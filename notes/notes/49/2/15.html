The words the “enmity in His flesh” may be in apposition to the “wall of partition” in the previous verse; or, as in our version, to “the law of commandments.” The general sense, however, is but little affected in either case.<p><span class= "bld">Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.</span>—In this difficult passage it will be well first to examine the particular expressions. (1) The word rendered “to abolish” is the word often used by St. Paul for “to supersede by something better than itself”—translated “to make void,” in <a href="/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>; to “bring to nought,” in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-28.htm" title="And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:">1Corinthians 1:28</a>, and (in the passive) “to fail,” “to vanish away,” “to be done away,” in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-10</a>. Now, of the relation of Christ to the Law, St. Paul says, in <a href="/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>, “Do we make void the Law? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.” The Law, therefore, is abolished as a law “in ordinances”—that is, “in the letter”—and is established in the spirit. (2) “The law of commandments in ordinances.” The word here rendered “ordinance” (<span class= "ital">dogma</span>) properly means “a decree.” It is used only in this sense in the New Testament (see <a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a>); and it signifies expressly a law imposed and accepted, not for its intrinsic righteousness, but on authority; or, as Butler expresses it (<span class= "ital">Anal., </span>Part ii., Ephesians 1), not a “moral,” but “a positive law.” In <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a> (the parallel passage) the word is connected with a “handwriting” that is a legal “bond”; and the Colossians are reproved for subjecting themselves to “ordinances, which are but a shadow of things to come”; while “the body,” the true substance, “is Christ.” (See <a href="/context/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16-17</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20-21</a>.) (3) Hence the whole expression describes explicitly what St. Paul always implies in his proper and distinctive use of the word “law.” It signifies the will of God, as expressed in formal commandments, and enforced by penalties on disobedience. The general idea, therefore, of the passage is simply that which is so often brought out in the earlier Epistles (see <a href="/context/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21-31</a>; <a href="/context/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?">Romans 7:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15-21</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but which (as the Colossian Epistle more plainly shows) now needed to be enforced under a somewhat different form—viz., that Christ, “the end of the law,” has superseded it by the free covenant of the Spirit; and that He has done this for us “in His flesh,” especially by His death and resurrection. (4) But in what sense is this Law called “the enmity,” which (see <a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>) was “slain” on the Cross? Probably in the double sense, which runs through the passage: first, as “an enmity,” a cause of separation and hostility, between the Gentiles and those Jews whom they called “the enemies of the human race”; next, as “an enmity” a cause of alienation and condemnation, between man and God—“the commandment which was ordained to life, being found to be unto death” through the rebellion and sin of man. The former sense seems to be the leading sense here, where the idea is of “making both one”; the latter in the next verse, which speaks of “reconciling both to God,” all the partitions are broken down, that all alike may have “access to the Father.” Comp. <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>, “You, who were enemies in your mind, He hath reconciled;” and <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>, “Having confidence to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated to us, <span class= "ital">through the veil, that is to say His flesh.”</span><p><span class= "bld">For to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.</span>—In this clause and the following verse the two senses, hitherto united, are now distinguished from each other. Here we have the former sense simply. In the new man “there is neither Jew nor Gentile,” but “Christ is all and in all” (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>). This phrase, “the new man” (on which see <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>), is peculiar to these Epistles; corresponding, however, to the “new creature” of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>, <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>; and the “newness of life” and “spirit” of <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>. Christ Himself is the “second man, the Lord from Heaven” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-47.htm" title="The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.">1Corinthians 15:47</a>). “As we have borne the image of the first man, of the earth, earthy,” and so “in Adam die,” we now “bear the image of the heavenly,” and not only “shall be made alive,” but already “have our life hid with Christ in God” (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>). He is at once “the seed of the woman” and the “seed of Abraham”; in Him, therefore, Jew and Gentile meet in a common humanity. Just in proportion to spirituality or newness of life is the sense of unity, which makes all brethren. Hence the new creation “makes peace”—here probably peace between Jew and Gentile, rather than peace with God, which belongs to the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;...">Ephesians 2:15-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Having abolished in his flesh </span>— By the sufferings and death endured therein; <span class="ital">the </span>cause of <span class="ital">enmity </span>between the Jews and Gentiles, <span class="ital">even the law </span>of ceremonial <span class="ital">commandments, contained in ordinances </span>— Consisting in many institutions and appointments concerning the outward worship of God; such as those of circumcision, sacrifices, clean and unclean meats, washings, and holy days; which, being founded in the mere pleasure of God, might be abolished when he saw fit.

Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having abolished - Having brought to naught, or put an end to it -  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  katarge&#772;sas.<p>In his flesh - By the sacrifice of his body on the cross. It was not by instruction merely; it was not by communicating the knowledge of God; it was not as a teacher; it was not by the mere exertion of power; it was by his flesh - his human nature - and this can mean only that he did it by his sacrifice of himself. It is such language as is appropriate to the doctrine of the atonement - not indeed teaching it directly - but still such as one would use who believed that doctrine, and such as no other one would employ. Who would now say of a moral teacher that he accomplished an important result by "his flesh?" Who would say of a man that was instrumental in reconciling his contending neighbors, that he did it "by his flesh?" Who would say of Dr. Priestley that he established Unitarianism "in his flesh?" No man would have ever used this language who did not believe that Jesus died as a sacrifice for sin.<p>The enmity - Between the Jew and the Gentile. Tyndale renders this, "the cause of hatred, that is to say, the law of commandments contained in the law written." This is expressive of the true sense. The idea is, that the ceremonial law of the Jews, on which they so much prided themselves, was the cause of the hostility existing between them. That made them different people, and laid the foundation for the alienation which existed between them. They had different laws; different institutions; a different religion. The Jews looked upon themselves as the favorites of heaven, and as in possession of the knowledge of the only way of salvation; the Gentiles regarded their laws with contempt, and looked upon the unique institutions with scorn. When Christ came and abolished by his death their special ceremonial laws, of course the cause of this alienation ceased.<p>Even the law of commandments - The law of positive commandments. This does not refer to the "moral" law, which was not the cause of the alienation, and which was not abolished by the death of Christ, but to the laws commanding sacrifices, festivals, fasts, etc., which constituted the uniqueness of the Jewish system. These were the occasion of the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles, and these were abolished by the great sacrifice which the Redeemer made; and of course when that was made, the purpose for which these laws were instituted was accomplished, and they ceased to be of value and to be binding.<p>Contained in ordinances - In the Mosaic commandments. The word "ordinance" means, decree, edict, law; <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>.<p>For to make in himself - By virtue of his death, or under him as the head.<p>Of twain one new man - Of the two - Jews and Gentiles - one new spiritual person; that they might be united. The idea is, that as two persons who had been at enmity, might become reconciled and be one in aim and pursuit, so it was in the effect of the work of Christ on the Jews and Gentiles. When they were converted they would be united and harmonious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Rather, make "enmity" an apposition to "the middle wall of partition"; "Hath broken down the middle wall of partition (not merely as English Version, 'between us,' but also between all men and God), to wit, the enmity (Ro 8:7) by His flesh" (compare Eph 2:16; Ro 8:3).<p>the law of commandments contained in&#8212;Greek, "the law of the commandments (consisting) in ordinances." This law was "the partition" or "fence," which embodied the expression of the "enmity" (the "wrath" of God against our sin, and our enmity to Him, Eph 2:3) (Ro 4:15; 5:20; 7:10, 11; 8:7). Christ has in, or by, His crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and enmity-creating power is concerned (Col 2:14), substituting for it the law of love, which is the everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from the realization in the soul of His love in His death for us. Translate what follows, "that He might make the two (Jews and Gentiles) into one new man." Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other, but incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man; the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His flesh on the cross. Observe, too, ONE new man; we are all in God's sight but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam [Alford].<p>making peace&#8212;primarily between all and God, secondarily between Jews and Gentiles; He being "our peace."

The ceremonial law, as appears by what follows, <p>even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; which consisted of many precepts, and carnal ordinances; and is so called because it was an indication of God's hatred of sin, by requiring sacrifice for it; and because it was an occasion of stirring up the enmity of the natural man, it being a burden and a weariness to the flesh, by reason of its many and troublesome rites; and because it was the cause of enmity between Jew and Gentile: the Jews say (g), that Sinai, the mount on which the law was given, signifies "hatred"; and that it is so called because from it descended  "hatred" or "enmity" to the nations of the world: now this Christ abolished, "in his flesh", or by it; not by his incarnation, but by the sacrifice of his flesh, or human nature, and that as in union with his divine nature; but not until he had fulfilled it in himself, which was one end of his coming into the world; and then he abolished it, so as that it ought not to be, and so as that it is not, and of no use and service; and that because it was faulty and deficient, weak and unprofitable, as well as intolerable; and because there was a change in the priesthood; and because it was contrary to a spirit of liberty, the great blessing of the Gospel; and that there might be a reconciliation and a coalition between Jew and Gentile, as follows: <p>for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; which explains what is meant before by making both one; and expresses the strictness of the union between Jew and Gentile, they became as one man; and points at the manner in which they became so strictly united; and that is by being made new men, or new creatures, by having a work of grace upon their souls, and so baptized into one body, and made to drink of one and the same Spirit; the foundation of which union is in himself; for Jew and Gentile, male and female, bond and free, are all one in Christ Jesus; he is the cornerstone in which they all meet, and the head to which the whole body is joined. <p>(g) T.

It is, after the example of Theodoret (comp. <span class="greekheb">τινές</span> in Chrysostom), understood by the majority (including Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Clarius, Grotius, Calovius, Morus, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Meier, Holzhausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette) of the <span class="ital">Mosaic law</span> as the <span class="ital">cause of the enmity</span> between Jew and Gentile, in which case the moral law is by some included, by others excluded. But, in accordance with <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>, the reader is led to nothing else than the opposite of <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to the abstract <span class="ital">enmity</span>; and in the sequel, indeed, the abolition of the law is very definitely distinguished from the destruction of the enmity (as means from end).

No doubt some have imputed to <span class="greekheb">ἐν δόγμασι</span> the sense <span class="ital">praecepta stabiliendo</span> (Fritzsche), in doing which they had in view the evangelical doctrine of faith and the <span class="ital">gratia universalis</span> (see Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret, Theophylact, Estius, Bengel, and others). But even thus the sense remains untrue and un-Pauline, seeing that the doing away of the law has taken place not at all in a doctrinal way, but <span class="ital">by the fact of the death of Christ</span> (<a href="/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?">Romans 7:1</a> f.; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>). And what a change would be made in the meaning of the word <span class="greekheb">δόγμα</span>, which in the N.T. signifies throughout nothing else than <span class="ital">injunction</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-4.htm" title=" And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.">Colossians 2:4</a>; <a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>; comp.

The distinction ought not to have been overlooked between <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΓΜΑ</span></span></span>, which latter puts the meaning of the former into the more definite form of the enjoining <span class="ital">decree</span>. A peculiar view is taken by Harless (followed by Olshausen) likewise connecting <span class="greekheb">ἐν δόγμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΡΓΉΣΑς</span></span></span>, and holding that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> denotes the “side on which that efficacy of the death of Christ exerts itself;” Christ did not render the law ineffectual in any such capacity as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΚΙᾺΝ ΤῶΝ ΜΕΛΛΌΝΤΩΝ</span></span></span>, or as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΑΓΩΓῸΝ ΕἸς ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span>, but <span class="ital">on the side of the</span> <span class="greekheb">δόγματα</span> (“in reference to the commanding form of its precepts,” Olshausen). Incorrectly, because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΓΜΑΣΙ</span></span></span> must of necessity have had <span class="ital">the article</span>, and because it is nowhere taught that the law is done away only <span class="ital">in a single respect</span>. The Mosaic legal institute <span class="ital">as such</span>, and not merely from a certain side, has in Christ its end (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>); the <span class="greekheb">σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων</span> in the law has only a transient typical destination (see on <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>), and the work of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΑΓΩΓΌς</span></span></span> is at an end with the attainment of maturity on the part of his pupils (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a> f.). Incorrect also is the view of Hofmann, p. 377, who, likewise taking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΔΌΓΜΑΣΙ</span></span></span> as modal definition to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΡΓΉΣΑς</span></span></span>, and for the expression with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> comparing <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>, finds the meaning: by the very fact that Christ has put an end to <span class="ital">precepts generally</span>, He has invalidated the O. T. law of commandments. The statement that Christ has put an end to <span class="greekheb">δόγματα</span> <span class="ital">generally</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">to commanding precepts in general</span>, is at variance with the whole N.T., which contains numberless definite commands, and, in particular, with the teaching of Paul, who even places Christianity as a whole under the point of view, <a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then?

No: but by the law of faith.">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="/romans/9-31.htm" title="But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.">Romans 9:31</a>, <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.">Galatians 6:2</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἔχθραν</span>: <span class="ital">to wit the enmity</span>. Many (Luth., Calv., De Wette, etc.) take this to be a figure for the Mosaic Law. But the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> is in antithesis to the <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span> of <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>, and the specification of the Law comes in later. It is better, therefore, to take the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> here in the abstract sense of <span class="ital">hostile, separating feeling</span>. But is it the enmity of Jew and Gentile to God (Chrys., Harl., etc.) or the enmity between Jew and Gentile? The statement of the <span class="greekheb">μεσότοιχον</span> as a mid-wall between <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἀμφότερα</span> decides for the latter. The argument in favour of this view is stronger still when the former view is connected with the idea that the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> is the Mosaic Law. For the Mosaic Law could not be said to have been the cause of hostile feeling on the part of Gentiles to God.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ σαρκί αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in His flesh</span>. The term <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> is taken by some (Stier, etc.) in a sense wide enough to cover Christ’s incarnation and His entire incarnate life. But, apart from other difficulties, this is inconsistent with the definite mention of His <span class="ital">blood</span> and His <span class="ital">cross</span>. The term refers, therefore, to His death, and means His crucified flesh (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>). The great difficulty here, however, is the connection. Some attach the phrase immediately to <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἔχθραν</span> (Chrys., etc.), “the enmity which was in His flesh,” as if the idea were “the hatred in the human race generally” or “the national hatred,” the hatred in the Jewish people. But this would require <span class="greekheb">τήν</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>, and furnishes at best a forced meaning. Most commentators connect it with <span class="greekheb">καταργήσας</span>, supposing it to be put emphatically first. So it is taken, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Meyer, who makes <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span> begin the new clause. The RV takes the same view, but brings the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθραν</span> under the regimen of the <span class="greekheb">καταργήσας</span>—“having abolished in His flesh the enmity, <span class="ital">even</span> the law”. There is much to say in support of this, especially in view of the Pauline statements in <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>; <a href="/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>, etc. On the other hand there is an awkwardness in bringing in the predication <span class="ital">before</span> the verb, and the parallelism is broken (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Alf.). It is best, therefore, to attach the <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ</span> to the <span class="greekheb">λύσας</span> (Calv., Rück., Alf., etc.). The form of the sentence is better kept in this way. The appropriateness of the use of <span class="greekheb">λύσας</span> is then seen; for the verb <span class="greekheb">λύειν</span> (= <span class="ital">subvert, dissolve</span>), is equally applicable to the <span class="greekheb">μεσότοιχον</span> and to the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθραν</span>, the phrase <span class="greekheb">λύειν ἔχθραν</span> being common in ordinary Greek. On the other hand <span class="greekheb">καταργεῖν</span> is much less applicable to <span class="greekheb">ἔχθραν</span>. So the sense is—“who in His crucified flesh (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, by His death on the cross) broke down the middle-wall of the partition, to wit the enmity” (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the hostile feeling between Jew and Gentile).—<span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν καταργήσας</span>: <span class="ital">having abolished</span> (or, in that He abolished) <span class="ital">the law of commandments</span> (expressed) <span class="ital">in ordinances</span>. Further statement of the way in which Christ by His death on the cross removed the separation and the hostile feeling between Jew and Gentile <span class="ital">viz.</span>, by abrogating the dividing Law itself. The Law is now introduced, and the term <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span> is to be taken in its full sense, not the <span class="ital">ceremonial</span> law only, but the Mosaic Law as a whole, according to the stated use of the phrase. This Law is <span class="ital">abolished</span> in the sense of being rendered <span class="ital">inoperative</span> (as <span class="greekheb">καταργεῖν</span> means), and it is defined as the Law <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν</span>. What is the point of the definition? The article, which is in place with the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολῶν</span>, is omitted before the <span class="greekheb">δόγμασιν</span>, as the latter makes one idea with the former and further is under the regimen of a prep. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., pp. 139, 149, 151, 158). The Law is one of “commandments-in-decrees”. What is in view is its character as mandatory, and consisting in a multitude of prescriptions or statutes. It <span class="ital">enjoined</span>, and it expressed its injunctions in so many decrees, but it did not enable. The Law was made up of <span class="greekheb">ἐντολαί</span> and these <span class="greekheb">ἐντολαί</span> expressed themselves and operated in the form of <span class="greekheb">δόγματα</span>, <span class="ital">ordinances</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">δόγμα</span> in the NT never means anything else than <span class="ital">statute, decree, ordinance</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>; in <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a> it is a variant for <span class="greekheb">διάταγμα</span>). Hence it cannot have any such sense here as <span class="ital">doctrines, evangelical teaching</span> (Theod.), <span class="ital">evangelical precepts</span> (Fritz.), the <span class="ital">faith</span> (Chrys.). Some taking the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> make it = “having abolished the law by injunctions” (Syr., Vulg., Arab., Grot., Beng., etc.). But the NT uniformly speaks of the abrogation of the condemning law as being effected by Christ’s death, never by His <span class="ital">teaching</span>, or by evangelical <span class="ital">precepts</span>. Another turn is given to the sentence by taking <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> in the sense of “in respect of,” “on the side of” (Harl.), as if the idea were that the abrogation of the Law was limited to its mandatory side,—to the <span class="ital">orders</span> contained in it. But this would require <span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> before the <span class="greekheb">δόγμασιν</span>; nor is it the way of the NT to speak of the Mosaic Law as done away by Christ only on one side.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα τοὺς δύο κτίσῃ ἐν ἑαυτῷ εἰς ἕνα καινὸν ἄνθρωπον</span>: <span class="ital">that He might create in Himself the two into one new man</span>. Statement of the object of the <span class="greekheb">καταργεῖν</span>. The masc. <span class="greekheb">δύο</span> is introduced now, instead of the <span class="greekheb">ἀμφότερα</span>, with a view to the <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον</span>. One <span class="ital">man</span> was to be made out of the two <span class="ital">men</span>. The <span class="greekheb">κτίσῃ</span> is better rendered <span class="ital">create</span> with the RV than <span class="ital">make</span> with the AV. A new <span class="ital">creation</span> is in view. For <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span> of the TR (with [160] [161] [162] [163], etc.) <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> is to be preferred as the reading of [164] [165] [166] [167], etc. (LTTrRV); WH gives <span class="greekheb">αὑτῷ</span>. In either case the sense is “in Himself”; not “by it” (Grot.) as if the reference were to Christ’s <span class="ital">doctrine</span>, nor “through Himself” as if it were <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>. The new creation and the new union have their ground and principle <span class="ital">in</span> Christ. What was contemplated, too, was not simply the making of <span class="ital">one man</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἕνα ἄνθρωπον</span>) where formerly there were two, but the making of <span class="ital">one new</span> (<span class="greekheb">καινὸν</span>) <span class="ital">man</span>. The result was not that, though the separation between them was removed, the Jew still remained Jew and the Gentile still Gentile. It was something new, the old distinctions between Jew and Gentile being lost in a third order of “man”—the Christian man.—<span class="greekheb">ποιῶν εἰρήνην</span>: <span class="ital">making peace</span>. The <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span> is still peace between the estranged Jew and Gentile, and the <span class="greekheb">ποιῶν</span> (<span class="ital">pres.</span>, not <span class="ital">aor.</span>) belongs to the object expressed by the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>. In carrying out that purpose He was to make peace the one with the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[160] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[161] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[162] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[163] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[164] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[165] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[166] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

In this difficult verse our best guide is the Ep. to the Romans, esp. <a href="/context/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?...">Romans 7:1-6</a>, <a href="/context/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death....">Romans 8:2-3</a>, passages very possibly in mind when this was written. See also the closely parallel passage, <a href="/context/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled...">Colossians 1:21-22</a>. With these in view we may interpret this to teach that the Lord, by His death (<a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>), “in the likeness of the flesh of sin” (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), broke (“annulled”) for all believers their condemning relations with the Law (in the highest sense of the word Law), as a preceptive code, prescribing but not enabling,—a code imposing absolute decrees as the absolute condition of acceptance; and thereby, <span class="ital">ipso facto</span>, brought to an end the Mosaic ordinances with their exclusions, which existed mainly to prefigure this Work, and to enforce the fact of its necessity, and incidentally to “fence in” the race through whom the Messiah, as the Worker, was to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage thus teaches that Christ has “annulled” the old antipathy between Jew and Gentile, by what He did in dying. But it cannot teach this without teaching also the deep underlying truth that He did it by effecting relations of acceptance and peace between Man and God; not putting aside the Preceptive Law as a thing obsolete, but so “going behind it” in his Atonement as to put believing man in a different relation to it, and so, and only so, removing the external hedges of privilege and exclusion. Comparing <a href="/context/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled...">Colossians 1:21-22</a>, it is plain that this greater reconciliation lies, in the Apostle’s thought, behind the lesser, though the lesser is more immediately in point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The commandments in decrees</span>” are, doubtless, in part, the “touch not, taste not,” of ceremonial restrictions; but not these only.

Here the great organism of the saints, Jew and Gentile, is viewed as, so to speak, one Person; a view closely akin to that of the “One Body” of Christ; 1 Corinthians 12, &c. “We are all in God’s sight but one in Christ, as we are all one in Adam” (Alford).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Old Race is <span class="ital">solidaire</span> with its Head, Adam, by solidarity of Nature in itself and of standing towards God.

It is a moot point whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is to be taken as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 14, or by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the end of this verse. Both A.V. and R.V. adopt the latter; but the former is more textual and natural. Another question is - What enmity? Some say between Jews and Gentiles; others, between both and God. The latter seems right; where "the enmity" is so emphatically referred to, it must be the great or fundamental enmity, and the whole tenor of the passage is to the effect that in the removal of the enmity of the sinner to God, the abolition of the enmity between Jew and Gentile was provided for. <span class="cmt_word">In his flesh.</span> These words are not to be connected with the enmity, for then they would require <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> before them, but with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 14) or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 15). In his flesh, crucified, broken, for our sins, Christ virtually broke down the enmity (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Having abolished the law of commandments in ordinances.</span> Some think that "in ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, doctrines) denotes the means by which the Law was abolished - by means of doctrines, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the doctrines of Christianity. But New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is not equal to "doctrine." "In ordinances" limits the law of commandments. The law abolished or superseded by Christ was the law of positive requirements embodied in things decreed, evidently the ceremonial law of the Jews; certainly not the moral law (see <a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>). By removing this, Jesus removed that which had become the occasion of bitter feelings between Jew and Gentile; the Jew looking down proudly on the Gentile, and the Gentile despising what he deemed the fantastic rites of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">That he might create the two in himself into one new man.</span> The idea of a corporate body comes here into view. Christ's object was not merely to restore individuals, but to rear <span class="accented">a Church</span>, composed of many units incorporated into one body. This idea is prominent in the rest of the Epistle. Hence the strong word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, create; not only is every believer a new creation, but the corporate organization into which they are built is also a creation. The two are made "one new man;" the Gentile is not turned into a Jew, nor the Jew into a Gentile, but both into one new man, thus removing all grounds of jealousy. This transformation is "in himself;" in vital union to Christ they are formed into one body. No Church connection of man with man is the true connection, unless it is founded on a mutual connection with Christ. <span class="cmt_word">So making peace</span>; that is, between Jew and Gentile. The peacemaking with God, as we have seen, is referred to in the first words of the verse; this at the end is the subordinate peacemaking, the result of the other. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Having abolished in His flesh the enmity (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>The enmity immediately follows the middle wall of partition, and should be rendered in apposition with and as defining it, and as dependent on brake down, not on abolished: the middle wall which was the enmity.
