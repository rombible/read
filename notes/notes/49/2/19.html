while the word translated “foreigners” signifies the resident aliens of an ancient city, who were but <span class= "ital">half-aliens, </span>having free intercourse with the citizens, although no rights of citizenship. The latter word is used literally in <a href="/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>; <a href="/acts/7-29.htm" title="Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.">Acts 7:29</a> (there rendered “sojourner”), and often in the LXX. version; perhaps metaphorically in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>. Such a sojourner, though in some sense less an absolute alien than the mere “stranger,” was one on whom by daily contrast the sense of being an alien, excluded from power and privilege, was more forcibly impressed.<p><span class= "bld">Fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.</span>—In sense this double expression preserves the double idea running through the whole chapter. The phrase “fellowcitizens of the saints” is applied to the Gentiles, as now united with the Israel of God in one “commonwealth.” (See above, <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>.) “Members of the household of God” refers rather to the union with God, restored by the blood of Jesus Christ. (See <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>.) As to the metaphor, the word “stranger”—that is, <span class= "ital">alien</span>—seems to be opposed to “fellowcitizen”<span class= "ital">;</span> the word “foreigner”—that is, <span class= "ital">half-alien</span>—to members of the household: for the resident aliens stood opposed to the “houses,” the families or clans, of the citizens—the unit in ancient law being always the family, and not the individual. The Gentiles were now brought into a “household,” and that household the household of God Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;...">Ephesians 2:19-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now, therefore </span>— Being thus reconciled; <span class="ital">ye </span>— Believing Gentiles; <span class="ital">are no more strangers and foreigners </span>— If it be necessary to make any distinction as to the signification of these two words, in the former, (<span class="greekheb">ζενοι</span>,) the apostle may refer to persons of a different country; and in the latter, (<span class="greekheb">παροικοι</span>,) to those of a different family. The following clause evidently leads to this sense. <span class="ital">But fellow-citizens with the saints </span>— The Church of God is here spoken of under the emblem of a city, as it is also <a href="/context/isaiah/26-1.htm" title="In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks....">Isaiah 26:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>, &c.; <a href="/isaiah/62-12.htm" title="And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.">Isaiah 62:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>, (where the original expression signifies, <span class="ital">our citizenship in heaven,</span>) as also <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,...">Revelation 21:10-27</a>, and in many other places of the Old and New Testaments. Of this city, the believers at Ephesus are here represented as genuine citizens, entitled to all the glorious immunities and privileges of it; <span class="ital">and of the household of God </span>— Members of his family, his servants, yea, his <span class="ital">sons and daughters. </span>As if he had said, God not only stands related to you as a king to his people, or the chief magistrate of a city to the citizens; but as a father to his children, who are under his peculiar protection and care, have the nearest access to him, and most intimate communion with him. “Perhaps,” says Doddridge, “this latter clause, <span class="greekheb">οικειοι του Θεου</span>, <span class="ital">domestics of God, </span>may have some relation to that peculiar <span class="ital">nearness to God </span>in which the Jewish priests were, and refer to that great intimacy of unrestrained converse with God, to which we, as Christians, are admitted; in which respect our privileges seem to resemble, not only those of the people praying in the common court of Israel, but those of the priests, worshipping in the house itself. Nay, it is elsewhere added, by a figure, which seems beautifully to rise even on this, that we have <span class="ital">confidence to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.” And are built </span>— Here the apostle alludes to a building, particularly to the temple at Jerusalem, to which he compares God’s visible church, as is evident from the subsequent verse; and he represents the believers at Ephesus as constituent parts of this building; <span class="ital">upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets </span>— the fundamental doctrines declared by them, on which the faith and hope of all true believers are built. God laid the foundation of his church by them. Thus the city of the living God, the new Jerusalem, which is the church of God, in its most perfect state in the world to come, is said (<a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>) to be built on the foundation of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. The Jewish prophets are also said, not improperly, to be the foundation of God’s church, because they bore testimony, though some of them in an obscure manner, to most of the doctrines of the gospel. Perhaps, however, as the prophets are here mentioned after the apostles, the Christian prophets may be meant; to whom, by a peculiar inspiration, the true meaning of the writings of Moses and the prophets was made known. <span class="ital">Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone </span>— Namely, of the foundation, holding the several parts of the building together, and supporting the chief weight of the edifice. It is true, this stone may be considered as placed either at the top or at the bottom of the building; but the latter seems here to be meant; because, in the following verse, the building is said to be fifty joined together by this stone, and <span class="ital">to grow </span>into a holy temple for the Lord. Elsewhere, Christ is termed the foundation itself, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>, where see the note. The Lord Jesus, however, is also <span class="ital">the head of the corner </span>— The top corner-stone; for so he terms himself <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>. <span class="ital">In </span>— Or <span class="ital">on; whom all the building </span>— The whole fabric of the universal church, with all its members, and the doctrines which they believe, the precepts which they obey, and the promises which they embrace, and in which they confide; yea, with all the blessings enjoyed in time, and expected in eternity; <span class="ital">fitly framed together </span>— Harmoniously joined in its several parts, and compacted so as to add beauty, strength, and unity to the whole; <span class="ital">groweth </span>— Riseth up like a large pile of living materials, namely, by the continual accession of new converts, and the advancing graces of those already converted; <span class="ital">unto a holy temple in the Lord </span>— Fitly dedicated to the Lord Christ, as being raised and supported by him; a temple in which God displays his presence, yea, dwells, and is worshipped in spirit and in truth.

It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church is also compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ; delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of God through the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopes are fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have we devoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are we habitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grieve the holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and his influences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the duties allotted to us, to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners - You are reckoned with the people of God.

Strangers and such as proposed to reside for a short time in Athens, were permitted to reside in the city, and to pursue their business undisturbed, but they could perform no public duty; they had no voice in the public deliberations, and they had no part in the management of the state. They could only look on as spectators, without mingling in the scenes of state, or interfering in any way in the affairs of the government.<p>They were bound humbly to submit to all the enactments of the citizens, and observe all the laws and usages of the republic.

Proselytes, who united themselves to the Jews, were also called in the Jewish writings, "strangers." All foreigners were regarded as "strangers," and Jews only were supposed to have near access to God. But now, says the apostle, this distinction is taken away, and the believing pagan, as well as the Jew, has the right of citizenship in the New Jerusalem, and one, as well as another, is a member of the family of God.

The conclusive <span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span> is one of Paul’s favourable particles. In his writings and in the NT generally it is sometimes placed second in the sentence, and sometimes (contrary to classical use) first. The combination <span class="greekheb">ἄρα οὖν</span> is peculiar to Paul, and takes the first place in the sentence. In this form it has less of the <span class="ital">ratiocinative</span> force and more of the <span class="ital">collective; cf.</span> Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T.

In the LXX it represents <span class="greekheb">תּוֹשָׁב</span> (nine times) or <span class="greekheb">גֵּר</span> (eleven times).

There is no reference to <span class="ital">proselytes</span> in particular (Baumg.).—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ συμπολῖται τῶν ἁγίων</span>: <span class="ital">but fellow-citizens with the saints</span>. Most critical editors (LTTrWHRV) insert <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, on the authority of [174] [175] [176] [177] [178], etc. The form <span class="greekheb">συνπολῖται</span> is preferred by Tisch., WH, Ell., Alf., etc. The word belongs mostly to late Greek. The <span class="greekheb">ἁγίων</span> is not to be restricted to <span class="ital">Jews</span>, the <span class="ital">patriarchs</span>, or <span class="ital">OT believers</span>, but is a comprehensive name for <span class="ital">Christians</span>, the whole community of believers in Christ without distinction of Jew and Gentile. The Jewish people were once “the saints” of God, and Gentiles stood outside having no part in their <span class="greekheb">πολιτεία</span>. Now all Gentile believers, like these Ephesians, form part of that greater “Israel of God (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>) which consists of all Christians, and share in all the rights of such.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ οἰκεῖοι τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">and of the household of God</span>.

In Greek writers of the later period <span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖος</span> is used frequently with the gens, of abstract nouns (<span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖοι φιλοσοφίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὀλιγαρχίας</span>, etc.) in the general sense of one <span class="ital">closely connected</span> with philosophy, etc., but without any specific reference either to the <span class="ital">house</span> of God, or to the <span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖοι</span> as forming one <span class="ital">family</span>. With the present case, however, it is different. The phrase <span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖοι Θεοῦ</span> naturally suggests the idea of members of God’s <span class="ital">household</span> or <span class="ital">family</span> (Mey.); <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;...">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-21.htm" title="And having an high priest over the house of God;">Hebrews 10:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[174] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[175] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[176] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.
