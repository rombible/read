A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hath raised us up together - That is, we are raised from the death of sin to the life of religion, in connection with the resurrection of Jesus, and in virtue of that.

Meier: “Exaltation into a celestially enlightened, pure and holy, state of life.” Matthies: “The spiritual kingdom of heaven or of God.” Olshausen: “The awakening of the heavenly consciousness.” Koppe remarks superficially and with hesitation: “Nobis quidem in omnibus his <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγείρεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθίζειν ἐν ἐπουρ</span>. nihil inesse videtur nisi summae et universae felicitatis, qua Christiani vel jam fruuntur, vel olim magis etiam fruituri sunt, descriptio.” According to Baumgarten-Crusius, there is expressed “exaltation into a purely spiritual heaven-like state.” De Wette takes <span class="greekheb">συνεζωοπ</span>. of the deliverance out of the misery of sin, <span class="greekheb">συνήγειρε</span> of regeneration and, <span class="ital">at the same time</span>, of the resurrection of the body guaranteed in the spiritual life, and <span class="greekheb">συνεκάθισεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. of the hope of the eternal <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>.

That is, to life now, in a present spiritual renewal. The <span class="greekheb">συνήγειρεν</span> expresses the definite idea of <span class="ital">resurrection</span>, and primarily that of the physical resurrection. The introduction of this term and the following makes it not improbable that both ideas, that of the present moral resurrection and that of the future bodily resurrection, were in Paul’s mind, and that he did not sharply distinguish between them, but thought of them as one great gift of life.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ συνεκάθισεν ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>: <span class="ital">and seated us</span> (or, enthroned us) <span class="ital">with Him in the heavenlies</span>. Made us sharers with Him in dignity and dominion, so that even now, and in foretaste of our future exaltation, our life and thought are raised to the heavenlies where He reigns. But as Bengel notices, Paul pauses here and does not add the <span class="greekheb">ἐν δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ</span> which is said of Christ in <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in Christ Jesus</span>. Not the <span class="greekheb">συνεκάθισεν</span> only, but the whole statement is qualified by this. This quickening, this resurrection, this seating of us with Him take effect in so far as we are <span class="ital">in</span> Him as our Representative, having our life and our completeness in our Head.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">and hath raised</span> us <span class="ital">up together</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">did raise</span>, &c.—The radical idea of <span class="ital">new life</span> is here put into more detail, as a resurrection and ascension; the special form of the Lord’s Revival.—“<span class="ital">Together:</span>”—the Gr. grammar allows this to refer to either (1) union with <span class="ital">the Church</span>, or (2) union with <span class="ital">the Lord;</span> (1) “as a united company,” or (2) “as united to Him.” And the words just below “<span class="ital">in</span> Him,” not “<span class="ital">with</span> Him,” may seem to favour the former. But the previous verse, and <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>; are strongly for the reference to Christ.

We, as “in Him,” vitally united to Him, are there also, in the sense of a supreme acceptance and welcome by the Eternal Father, and of the sure prospect of heavenly “glorification together [with Christ]” (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in heavenly places</span>] See on <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνεκάθισεν</span>, <span class="ital">made us sit together</span>) Believers are already spiritually raised; they will be raised in the body; and to each of the two resurrections the sitting in heavenly places corresponds. They are not, indeed, present in heaven in the body, but they are so in point of right, and virtually in the spirit, and they have individually a seat expressly assigned to them, which is to be taken possession of at the proper time. They are for a while hidden in God; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>, <span class="ital">in the heavenlies</span>) He does not say, <span class="ital">on the right hand</span>.

Such was the case of the three disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration; of the two on the way to Emmaus, when their heart burned within them; of the beloved disciple when he was "in the Spirit on the Lord's day;" of many at the Holy Supper, or in fervent communion with brother and sister believers, when they seem at the very gate of heaven. This is sometimes the experience at conversion, but the vividness of the feeling does not always abide. The repetition of "in Christ Jesus" in this connection emphasizes the fact that this gracious proceeding of God towards us is in immediate connection with the work and person of Christ.
