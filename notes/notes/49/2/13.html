The phrase "afar off" - &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;  makran - means that they were formerly far off from God and his people. The expression is derived from the custom of speaking among the Hebrews. God was supposed to reside in the temple. It was a privilege to be near the temple. Those who were remote from Jerusalem and the temple were regarded as far off from God, and hence as especially irreligious and wicked; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>.<p>Are made nigh - Are admitted to the favor of God, and permitted to approach him as his worshippers.<p>By the blood of Christ - The Jews came near to the mercy seat on which the symbol of the divine presence rested (the notes at <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), by the blood that was offered in sacrifice; that is, the high priest approached that mercy-seat with blood and sprinkled it before God. Now we are permitted to approach him with the blood of the atonement.

In classical Greek <span class="greekheb">νυνί</span> is used only of <span class="ital">time</span>, mostly with <span class="ital">present</span> tenses, rarely with the future, and means <span class="ital">at this very moment</span>.

Here it has the usual temporal meaning—<span class="ital">now</span> as contrasted with the previous period, the <span class="greekheb">καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</span> is put emphatically first and is to be connected with the <span class="greekheb">νυνί</span> (Ell., etc.) rather than with the <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθητε</span>, the point being this—<span class="ital">then</span> ye were separate from Christ, but <span class="ital">now</span> ye are in Him, united with Him, and so are become nigh. It is difficult, if not impracticable, to discover in each case a reason for the use of <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς</span> instead of the simple <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span>; and the <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span> indeed is dropped by some ancient authorities (L., Iren., Orig., Tert., etc.). But the double designation is appropriate here—<span class="ital">then</span> they were without <span class="ital">Christ</span>, having no part in the Messiah in whom the Jew had hope; <span class="ital">now</span> they are in living, present, personal fellowship with the Saviour known among men as Christ Jesus. The <span class="greekheb">μακράν</span> repeats the idea of distance and separation previously expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ξένοι</span>. The expression <span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς γίνεσθαι</span>, to <span class="ital">come</span> or <span class="ital">become near</span>, which is common enough in profane Greek, occurs only here in the NT. The order of the TR, <span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς ἐγενήθητε</span>, is supported by [153] [154] [155] [156], etc.; but <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθητε ἐγγύς</span> is the reading of [157] [158] [159], 17, Vulg., Goth., etc., and is adopted by most (LTTrWHRV). For the designation of the Gentiles as “far off” and the use of the phrase “bring nigh” in the sense of making them members of the theocracy, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-7.htm" title="O LORD, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.">Daniel 9:7</a>; and for examples in Jewish literature, see Wetst., <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; Schöttg., <span class="ital">Horæ Hebr.</span>, i., 76. The verses which immediately follow refer to the removal of the ancient barrier between Jew and Gentile. The <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθητε ἐγγύς</span>, however, need not be restricted to that. It is in contrast with the whole previous condition of separation from Christ, with all that that meant with regard to the commonwealth of Israel, the covenants, hope, and God. It is probably to be taken, therefore, in the large sense of being brought into the Kingdom of God, made near to God Himself and so brought to hope and privilege.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αἵματι τοῦ χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in</span> (or, <span class="ital">by</span>) <span class="ital">the blood of Christ</span>. On the import of the phrase “the blood of Christ” see under <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a> above. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> here has much the same sense as the <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> there. They both express <span class="ital">instrumentality</span>. If there is any difference between them it is that <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> expresses simple, objective, instrumentality, while <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> denotes what Ell. calls <span class="ital">immanent</span> instrumentality, the action of the verb being regarded as <span class="ital">existing in the means</span>. See Ell. on the present passage and on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm" title="Why comfort one another with these words.">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>.

Just before, <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>, we have “without <span class="ital">Christ</span>” merely; here, “in Christ <span class="ital">Jesus</span>.” The Messiah of Prophecy is now known as also the <span class="ital">Jesus</span> of the Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sometimes</span>] <span class="bld">Once</span>, as R.

Cp. <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>, and see <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>.—The thought of remoteness and nearness in respect of <span class="ital">God</span> is of course implied, and comes out clearly in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>; but it is not the immediate thought of this passage, which rather speaks of the incorporation of once heathen souls into the true <span class="ital">Israel</span>. But the two views cannot be quite separated.—“Nigh” and “far” were familiar terms with the Rabbis in the sense of having or not having part in the covenant. Wetstein on this verse quotes, <span class="ital">inter alia</span>, the following from the Talmud: “A woman came to R. Eliezer, to be made a proselyte; saying to him, <span class="ital">Rabbi, make me nigh</span>. He refused her, and she went to R. Joshua, who received her. The scholars of R. Joshua therefore said, <span class="ital">Did R. Eliezer put her far off, and dost thou make her nigh?</span>”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the blood of Christ</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">in the blood</span>, &c. To illustrate the phrase cp. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>; “almost all things according to the law are purged <span class="ital">in blood;</span>” “the High Priest entereth the Holy Place … <span class="ital">in blood</span> not his own.” Whatever the first use of the phrase, it had thus become an almost technicality of sacrificial language, nearly equalling “<span class="ital">with</span> (shed) blood” as the accompanying condition of acceptable approach. It is not necessary to import into the idea here the other, though kindred, idea of washing in blood, or even of surrounding with a circle of sprinkled blood. The “<span class="ital">in</span>” is, by usage, as nearly <span class="ital">instrumental</span> as possible. The sacred bloodshedding of the Messiah’s sacrificial death for His true Israel was the necessary condition to, and so instrument of, the admission of the new Gentile members. It is the “blood <span class="ital">of the covenant</span>” (<a href="/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>; quoted <a href="/hebrews/9-20.htm" title="Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined to you.">Hebrews 9:20</a>); and cp. the all-important words of the Lord Himself (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), “This is My blood <span class="ital">of the new Covenant</span>, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μακρὰν</span>) <span class="ital">far off</span> from the people of God, and from God, <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">αἵματι</span>, <span class="ital">by the blood</span>) ch. <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>; antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 11, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> in ver. 12. Another of the very powerful "<span class="accented">buts"</span> of this Epistle, completely reversing the picture going before (see ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus.</span> This expression is the pivot of the Epistle, denoting, not only that Christ Jesus is the Source of blessing, but also that we get the blessing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by vital union and fellowship with, him. The "without Christ" of ver. 12 contrasts powerfully with "in Christ Jesus" of this verse; and the addition of "Jesus" to the name is significant, denoting his saving power, denoting One who is not merely an official Savior, but to whom we get linked by all manner of endearing qualities and personal attractions, whose human name is Jesus, because he saves his people from their sins. <span class="cmt_word">Ye that once were far off are become near.</span> The apostle has slidden into a new figure; formerly the contrast was between death and life, now it is between distance and nearness. Not merely geographical distance, or remoteness in respect of outward position, but moral distance too: ye were far off from God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his favor, his fellowship, his gracious pardoning and renewing grace. In this sense too ye are now brought near. God is become your God and Father. Your orbit is changed to a near and blessed position, where the light of God's countenance falls upon you. <span class="cmt_word">In the blood of Christ.</span> This is the particular instrument of the change; not merely Christ manifesting the Father's readiness to receive you, but shedding his blood to make atonement for you (see <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (not merely <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) is again significant, denoting more than the instrumentality, viz. personal connection with the blood, as if sprinkled on us, so that we are symbolically in it. Cleansing us from all sin, it brings us nigh. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Now in Christ Jesus<p>Now, in contrast with at that time.
