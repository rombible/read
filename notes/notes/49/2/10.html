The word rendered “workmanship” is only used elsewhere in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>, where it is applied to the “works” of God in creation. Probably here also it does not exclude our first creation. We are His wholly and absolutely. But the next clause shows that St. Paul refers especially to the “new creation” in Christ Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">Created in</span> <span class= "bld">Christ Jesus.</span>—This creation, when spoken of distinctively, is the “new creation” (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>); as, indeed, is the case below (<a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>), “to create in Himself . . . one new man.” In this passage, however, St. Paul dwells, not on distinction from the old creation, but rather on analogy to it; in both we are simply God’s creatures.<p><span class= "bld">Unto good works</span>.—Properly, <span class= "ital">on the basis</span> (or, <span class= "ital">condition</span>)<span class= "ital"> of good works</span> (as in <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2Timothy 2:14</a>).

In much the same sense St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="/context/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12-13</a>), uses the well-known paradox, “Work out your own salvation . . . , for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” Both truths—God’s preordination and man’s responsible freedom—are emphasised. For the reconcilement of the two we must wait till we “know even as we are known.”<p>(2 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) <a href="/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>, resuming the thread of argument from <a href="/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>, dwell on the drawing of the Gentiles into a personal unity with God in Christ-not, however (as before), out of the deadness of sin and bondage of Satan, but rather out of the condition of alienation from God, from His covenant and His promise, in which they stood contrasted with His chosen people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">GOD’S WORKMANSHIP AND OUR WORKS</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>The metal is molten as it runs out of the blast furnace, but it soon cools and hardens. Paul’s teaching about salvation by grace and by faith came in a hot stream from his heart, but to this generation his words are apt to sound coldly, and hardly theological. But they only need to be reflected upon in connection with our own experience, to become vivid and vital again. The belief that a man may work towards salvation is a universal heresy. And the Apostle, in the context, summons all his force to destroy that error, and to substitute the great truth that we have to begin with an act of God’s, and only after that can think about our acts. To work up towards salvation is, in the strict sense of the words, preposterous; it is inverting the order of things. It is beginning at the wrong end. It is saying X Y Z before you have learnt to say A B C. We are to work downwards from salvation because we have it, not that we may get it. And whatever ‘good works’ may mean, they are the consequences, not the causes, of ‘salvation,’ whatever that may mean. But they are consequences, and they are the very purpose of it. So says Paul in the archaic language of my text-which only wants a little steadfast looking at to be turned into up-to-date gospel-’We are His workmanship, created unto good works’; and the fact that we are is one great reason for the assertion which he brings it in to buttress, that we are saved by grace, not by works. Now, I wish, in the simplest possible way, to deal with these great words, and take them as they lie before us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We have, first, then, this as the root of everything, the divine creation.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, you will find that in this profound letter of the Apostle there are two ideas cropping up over and over again, both of them representing the facts of the Christian life and of the transition from the unchristian to the Christian; and the one is Resurrection and the other is Creation. They have this in common, that they suggest the idea that the great gift which Christianity brings to men-no, do not let me use the abstract word ‘Christianity’-the great gift which Christ brings to men-is a new life. The low popular notion that salvation means mainly and primarily immunity from the ultimate, most lasting future consequences of transgression, a change of place or of condition, infects us all, and is far too dominant in our popular notions of Christianity and of salvation. And it is because people have such an unworthy, narrow, selfish idea of what ‘salvation’ is that they fall into the bog of misconception as to how it is to be attained. The ordinary man’s way of looking at the whole matter is summed up in a sentence which I heard not long since about a recently deceased friend of the speaker’s, and the like of which you have no doubt often heard and perhaps said, ‘He is sure to be saved because he has lived so straight.’ And at the foundation of that confident epitaph lay a tragical, profound misapprehension of what salvation was.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For it is something done in you; it is not something that you get, but it is something that you become. The teaching of this letter, and of the whole New Testament, is that the profoundest and most precious of all the gifts which come to us in Jesus Christ, and which in their totality are summed up in the one word that has so little power over us, because we understand it so little, and know it so well-’salvation’-is a change in a man’s nature so deep, radical, vital, as that it may fairly be paralleled with a resurrection from the dead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, I venture to believe that it is something more than a strong rhetorical figure when that change is described as being the creation of a new man within us. The resurrection symbol for the same fact may be treated as but a symbol. You cannot treat the teaching of a new life in Christ as being a mere figure. It is something a great deal more than that, and when once a man’s eye is opened to look for it in the New Testament it is wonderful how it flashes out from every page and underlies the whole teaching. The Gospel of John, for example, is but one long symphony which has for its dominant theme ‘I am come that they might have life.’ And that great teaching-which has been so vulgarised, narrowed, and mishandled by sacerdotal pretensions and sacramentarian superstitions-that great teaching of Regeneration, or the new birth, rests upon this as its very basis, that what takes place when a man turns to Jesus Christ, and is saved by Him, is that there is communicated to him not in symbol but in spiritual fact {and spiritual facts are far more true than external ones which are called real} a spark of Christ’s own life, something of ‘that spirit of life which was in Christ Jesus,’ and by which, and by which alone, being transfused into us, we become ‘free from the law of sin and death.’ I beseech you, brethren, see that, in your perspective of Christian truth, the thought of a new life imparted to us has as prominent and as dominant a place as it obviously has in the teaching of the New Testament. It is not so dominant in the current notions of Christianity that prevail amongst average people, but it is so in all men who let themselves be guided by the plain teaching of Christ Himself and of all His servants. Salvation? Yes! And the very essence of the salvation is the breathing into me of a divine life, so that I become partaker of ‘the divine nature.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, there is another step to be taken, and that is that this new life is realised in Christ Jesus. Now, this letter of the Apostle is distinguished even amongst his letters by the extraordinary frequency and emphasis with which he uses that expression ‘in Christ Jesus.’ If you will take up the epistle, and run your eye over it at your leisure, I think you will be surprised to find how, in all connections, and linked with every sort of blessing and good as its condition, there recurs that phrase. It is ‘in Christ’ that we obtain the inheritance; it is ‘in Christ’ that we receive ‘redemption, even the forgiveness of sins’; it is in Him that we are ‘builded together for a habitation of God’; it is in Him that all fulness of divine gifts, and all blessedness of spiritual capacities, is communicated to us; and unless, in our perspective of the Christian life, that expression has the same prominence as it has in this letter, we have yet to learn the sweetest sweetness, and have yet to receive the most mighty power, of the Gospel that we profess. ‘In Christ’-a union which leaves the individuality of the Saviour and of the saint unimpaired, because without such individuality sweet love were slain, and there were no communion possible, but which is so close, so real, so vital, as that only the separating wall of personality and individual consciousness comes in between-that is the New Testament teaching of the relation of the Christian to Christ. Is it your experience, dear brother? Do not be frightened by talking about mysticism. If a Christianity has no mysticism it has no life. There is a wholesome mysticism and there is a morbid one, and the wholesome one is the very nerve of the Gospel as it is presented by Jesus Himself: ‘I am the Vine, ye are the branches. Abide in Me, and I in you.’ If our nineteenth century busy Christianity could only get hold of that truth as firmly as it grasps the representative and sacrificial character of Christ’s work, I believe it would come like a breath of spring over ‘the winter of our discontent,’ and would change profoundly and blessedly the whole contexture of modern Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And now there is another step to take, and that is that this union with Christ, which results in the communication of a new life, or, as my text puts it, a new creation, depends upon our faith. We are not passive in the matter. There is the condition on which the entrance of the life into our spirits is made possible. You must open the door, you must fling wide the casement, and the blessed warm morning air of the sun of righteousness, with healing in its beams, will rush in, scatter the darkness and raise the temperature. ‘Faith’ by which we simply mean the act of the mind in accepting and of the will and heart in casting one’s self upon Christ as the Saviour-that act is the condition of this new life. And so each Christian is ‘God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And now, says Paul-and here some of us will hesitate to follow him-that new creation has to go before what you call ‘good works.’ Now, do not let us exaggerate. There has seldom been a more disastrous and untrue thing said than what one of the Fathers dared to say, that the virtues of godless men were ‘splendid vices.’ That is not so, and that is not the New Testament teaching. Good is good, whoever does it. But, then, no man will say that actions, however they may meet the human conception of excellence, however bright, pure, lofty in motive and in aim they may be, reach their highest possible radiance and are as good as they ought to be, if they are done without any reference to God and His love. Dear brethren, we surely do not need to have the alphabet of morality repeated to us, that the worth of an action depends upon its motive, that no motive is correspondent to our capacities and our relation to God and our consequent responsibilities, except the motive of loving obedience to Him. Unless that be present, the brightest of human acts must be convicted of having dark shadows in it, and all the darker because of the brightness that may stream from it. And so I venture to assert that since the noblest systems of morality, apart from religion, will all coincide in saying that to be is more than to do, and that the worth of an action depends upon its motive, we are brought straight up to the ‘narrow, bigoted’ teaching of the New Testament, that unless a man is swayed by the love of God in what he does, you cannot, in the most searching analysis, say that his deed is as good as it ought to be, and as it might be. To be good is the first thing, to do good is the second. Make the tree good and its fruit good. And since, as we have made ourselves we are evil, there must come a re-creation before we can do the good deeds which our relation to God requires at our hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. I ask you to look at the purpose of this new creation brought out in our text.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Created in Christ Jesus unto good works.’ That is what life is given to you for. That is why you are saved, says Paul. Instead of working upwards from works to salvation, take your stand at the received salvation, and understand what it is for, and work downwards from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, do not let us take that phrase, ‘good works,’ which I have already said came hot from the Apostle’s heart, and is now cold as a bar of iron, in the limited sense which it has come to bear in modern religious phraseology. It means something a great deal more than that. It covers the whole ground of what the Apostle, in another of his letters, speaks of when he says, ‘Whatsoever things are lovely and of good report, if there be any virtue’-to use for a moment the world’s word, which has such power to conjure in Greek ethics-’or if there be any praise’-to use for a moment the world’s low motive, which has such power to sway men-’think of these things,’ and these things do. That is the width of the conception of ‘good works’; everything that is ‘lovely and of good report.’ That is what you receive the new life for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Contrast that with other notions of the purpose of revelation and redemption. Contrast it with what I have already referred to, and so need not enlarge upon now, the miserably inadequate and low notions of the essentials of salvation which one hears perpetually, and which many of us cherish. It is no mere immunity from a future hell. It is no mere entrance into a vague heaven. It is not escaping the penalty of the inexorable law, ‘Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap,’ that is meant by ‘salvation,’ any more than it is putting away the rod, which the child would be all the better for having administered to him, that is meant by ‘forgiveness.’ But just as forgiveness, in its essence, means not suspension nor abolition of penalty, but the uninterrupted flow of the Father’s love, so salvation in its essence means, not the deliverance from any external evil or the alteration of anything in the external position, but the revolution and the re-creation of the man’s nature. And the purpose of it is that the saved man may live in conformity with the will of God, and that on his character there may be embroidered all the fair things which God desires to see on His child’s vesture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Contrast it with the notion that an orthodox belief is the purpose of revelation. I remember hearing once of a man that ‘he was a very shady character, but sound on the Atonement.’ What is the use of being ‘sound on the Atonement’ if the Atonement does not make you live the Christ life? And what is the good of all your orthodoxy unless the orthodoxy of creed issues in orthopraxy of conduct? There are far too many of us who half-consciously do still hold by the notion that if a man believes rightly then that makes him a Christian. My text shatters to pieces any such conception. You are saved that you may be good, and do good continually; and unless you are so doing you may be steeped to the eyebrows in the correctest of creeds, and it will only drown you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Contrast this conception of the purpose of Christianity with the far too common notion that we are saved, mainly in order that we may indulge in devout emotions, and in the outgoing of affection and confidence to Jesus Christ. Emotional Christianity is necessary, but Christianity, which is mainly or exclusively emotional, lives next door to hypocrisy, and there is a door of communication between them. For there is nothing more certain and more often illustrated in experience than that there is a strange underground connection between a Christianity which is mainly fervid and a very shady life. One sees it over and over again. And the cure of that is to apprehend the great truth of my text, that we are saved, not in order that we may know aright, nor in order that we may feel aright, but in order that we may be good and do ‘good works.’ In the order of things, right thought touches the springs of right feeling, and right feeling sets going the wheels of right action. Do not let the steam all go roaring out of the waste-pipe in however sacred and blessed emotions. See that it is guided so as to drive the spindles and the shuttles and make the web.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. And now, lastly, and only a word-here we have the field provided for the exercise of the ‘good works.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Created unto good works which God has before prepared’-before the re-creation-’that we should walk in them.’ That is to say, the true way to look at the life is to regard it as the exercising-ground which God has prepared for the development of the life that, through Christ, is implanted in us. He cuts the channels that the stream may flow. That is the way to look at tasks, at difficulties. Difficulty is the parent of power, and God arranges our circumstances in order that, by wrestling with obstacles, we may gain the ‘thews that throw the world,’ and in order that in sorrows and in joys, in the rough places and the smooth, we may find occasions for the exercise of the goodness which is lodged potentially in us, when He creates us in Christ Jesus. So be sure that the path and the power will always correspond. God does not lead us on roads that are too steep for our weakness, and too long for our strength. What He bids us do He fits us for; what He fits us for He thereby bids us do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so, dear brother, take heed that you are fulfilling the purpose for which you receive this new life. And let us all remember the order in which being and doing come. We must be good first, and then, and only then, shall we do good. We must have Christ for us first, our sacrifice and our means of receiving that new life, and then, Christ in us, the soul of our souls, the Life of our lives, the source of all our goodness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘If any power we have, it is to ill,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And all the power is Thine to do and eke to will.’</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ephesians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we are his workmanship </span>— As if he had said, And it appears that it is not by any works or ability of our own that we are saved, or possess the faith whereby salvation is received, because all the ability we have in spiritual things is from God, and is the consequence of his creating us anew; for as all acts of acceptable obedience must proceed from faith, and this faith is wrought in our hearts by the gracious influence of the Divine Spirit, it is most certain that we must acknowledge ourselves to be his workmanship, so far as there is any thing in us agreeable to the nature and will of God; being <span class="ital">created </span>in and through <span class="ital">Christ Jesus unto good works </span>— In order that we may have inclination and power both to perform them, and to delight in so doing; and may give ourselves up to this, and be continually engaged therein, as far as we have ability and opportunity.

In other words, He hath purified the fountain, that the streams may be pure; hath made the tree good, that the fruit may be good; hath made us new creatures, that we may live new lives; one grand and important end certainly of our regeneration.

A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are his workmanship - We are his "making" - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  poie&#772;ma.

Whatever of peace, or hope, or purity we have, has been produced by his agency on the soul.

The primary object was not to bring us to heaven. It was that we should be "holy." Paul held perhaps more firmly than any other man, to the position that people are saved by the mere grace of God, and by a divine agency on the soul; but it is certain that no man ever held more firmly that people must lead holy lives, or they could have no evidence that they were the children of God.<p>Which God hath before ordained - Margin, "prepared." The word here used means to "prepare beforehand," then to predestinate, or appoint before. The proper meaning of this passage is, "to which &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2;  hois good works God has predestinated us, or appointed us beforehand, that we should walk in them." The word used here - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  proetoimazo&#772; - occurs in the New Testament nowhere else except in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>, where it is rendered "had afore prepared." It involves the idea of a previous determination, or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. The previous preparation here referred to was, the divine intention; and the meaning is, that God had predetermined that we should lead holy lives. It accords, therefore, with the declaration in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, that he had chosen his people before the foundation of the world that they should be holy: see the notes at that verse.<p>That we should walk in them - That we should live holy lives.

Not as men only, but as Christians; not as creatures merely, but as new creatures; the work of grace upon the soul seems chiefly designed, which like a poem, as the word may be rendered, is a very curious work; the king's daughter is all glorious within, for this is an internal work, and is a good and excellent one; it is not indeed perfected at once, but is gradually carried on, till the finishing stroke is given to it by that hand which begun it; the author of it is God, it is not man's work; nor is it the work of ministers, no, nor of angels, but it is God's work: sometimes it is ascribed to the Spirit, who regenerates and sanctifies; and sometimes to the Son of God, who quickens whom he will; and sometimes to the Father, who reveals his Son, and draws men to him, and who seems to be meant here: the subjects of this divine operation, are the persons described in <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a> and include both Jews and Gentiles; and express the distinguishing grace of God, that they and not others, and who were by nature children of wrath as others, should be his workmanship: and this is mentioned to show, that salvation can not be by any works of men, since all their works are either wrought for them, or in them, by God; salvation is a work wrought for them without them; and sanctification is a work wrought in them by God, of his good pleasure; and all their good works are fruits of his grace, as follows: <p>created in Christ Jesus unto good works; the work of grace is a creation, or a creature, a new creature; not a new vamp of old Adam's principles, but; an infusion of new ones, and is a work of almighty power; and such who have it wrought in them, are said to be created in Christ; because as soon as a man becomes a new creature, he is openly and visibly in Christ; and by these new principles of grace which are created in him, he is fit and ready, and in a capacity to perform good works; the new man formed in him, is formed for righteousness and true holiness; the internal principle of grace both excites unto, and qualifies for, the performance of righteous and holy actions: <p>which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them, or has "before prepared"; for the preparation of good works to be performed by saints, and the preparation of them for the performance of them; are both from the Lord; God has appointed good works to be done by his people and in his word he has declared what they are he would have done; and it is his will not only that they should do them, but continue to do them; not only that they should do a single act or more, but walk in them; their conversation and course of life should be one continued series of good works; but the intention is not that they should be saved by them, but that they should walk in them; and this being the pre-ordination of God, as it shows that predestination is not according to good works, since good works are the fruits and effects of it, so likewise that it is no licentious doctrine; seeing it provides for the performance of good works, as well as secures grace and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For we are <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</span><p>(i) He speaks here of grace, and not of nature: therefore if the works are ever so good, see what they are, and know that they are that way because of grace.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>.

[E. T. 203]), for <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> (Syriac, Gothic, Vulgate, Castalio, Beza, Calvin, Piscator, Estius, Grotius, and others, including Harless, Matthies, Holzhausen, Olshausen, de Wette, Lamping, p. 87 f.; Bleek): <span class="ital">which God hath before</span> (previously to the <span class="greekheb">κτισθένες</span>) <span class="ital">placed in readiness, in order that we might walk in them</span>, that they might be the element in which our life-walk should take place (<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐπʼ αὐτοῖς ἄπαυστον σχέσιν δηλοῖ</span>, Oecumenius). The prefixed <span class="greekheb">προητ</span>. has in the circumstances significant emphasis. Paul conceives, namely, of the morally good works in which the walk of the Christian moves, as being already, even before his conversion, <span class="ital">placed in readiness</span> (Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 230 E; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xvii. 5, 6; LXX. <a href="/isaiah/28-24.htm" title="Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?">Isaiah 28:24</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/9-8.htm" title="Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.">Wis 9:8</a>) by God, namely, in His decree. And this <span class="ital">could not but</span> be the case, if God would <span class="ital">create</span> unto good works. For, if the converted man is God’s <span class="ital">creature</span>, then the moral activity of life, in which the specific nature of the <span class="greekheb">καινὴ κτίσις</span> is to manifest itself, and without which he would <span class="ital">not</span> be God’s <span class="greekheb">ποίημα</span> and <span class="greekheb">κτίσις</span>, must likewise proceed from God; consequently, when the moral creative act (the regeneration) is accomplished, must already in God’s counsel and will be in such wise <span class="ital">prepared</span> and <span class="ital">held ready</span> for communication, that it has to receive the new creature from its Creator, and in this way to work the works of <span class="ital">God</span>. Thus these good works following regeneration are as it were outflowings from a divine treasure beforehand placed in readiness, from which the regenerate man has <span class="ital">received</span> them, when he <span class="ital">does</span> them and <span class="ital">walks</span> in them.[144] The sense of the word <span class="greekheb">προετοιμάξειν</span> is changed, if it is explained only as <span class="ital">to predestine</span> (Augustine and others, including Harless, Lamping), which would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">προορίξειν</span> (see Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> II. p. 339); and it is <span class="ital">rationalized away</span>, when Olshausen says that the <span class="ital">circumstances and relations</span>, under which it is <span class="ital">possible</span> to men to perform good works, are ordained by God. It is not of the <span class="ital">circumstances</span> which render the works possible, but of the <span class="ital">works themselves</span>, that Paul affirms that God has before placed them in readiness; as accordingly, when they are accomplished, it is God who works the <span class="ital">willing</span> and <span class="ital">working</span> (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>). According to Hofmann, <span class="ital">Sehriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 365, II. 2, p. 294, the good works are once for all present <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, so that they need not to be brought forth first by us the individuals, but are produced beforehand, in order that our fellowship with Christ may be also a fellowship of His conduct—that our walk in <span class="ital">Him</span> may be a walk in <span class="ital">them</span>. But in this way Paul would have left the very point of the thought in <span class="greekheb">προητοίμ</span>. (namely, <span class="ital">in Christ</span>) unexpressed. Others take <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> as dative of the <span class="ital">destination: wnto which God hath prepared us</span> (Luther, Clericus, Semler, Michaelis, Zachariae, Morus, Flatt, Meier, Schenkel, and others). In this case, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐν αὐτοῖς περιπ</span>. would by no means be a redundant and feeble tautology, as Harless supposes, but an emphatic epexegesis of <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span>. But against this view it may be urged that Paul must necessarily, because the verb would be quite objectless, have added <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>,[145] the omission of which, considering the frequency of the attraction of <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἅ</span></span></span>, could only have led the reader astray; moreover, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟ</span></span></span> would receive no emphasis accordant with the prefixing of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΗΤΟΊΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, inasmuch as the time of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΤΟΙΜΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> would coincide with that of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>.

But how arbitrarily in this way is <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> referred to what is more remote and different from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΟῖς</span></span></span>! and how changed is the literal sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΤΟΙΜΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>! Quite arbitrary and erroneous, finally, is the view of Bengel, Koppe, and Rosenmüller, as also of Baumgarten-Crusius, that it is to be explained <span class="ital">per Hebraismum</span> (see, on the other hand, Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Matth.</span> p. 139) for <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς ἵνα περιπατήσωμεν προητ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>, in which case Koppe and Rosenmüller make <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΤΟΙΜΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> equivalent to <span class="ital">velle, jubere!</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Schwegler, in Zeller’s <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> 1844, p. 391; Baur, <span class="ital">Paulus</span>, p. 453, and de Wette, there is to be discovered in our passage the post-apostolic tendency to combine the doctrine of Paul (<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων</span>) with the Jewish-Christian view (that of James) concerning good works. As though the works were not in our passage too, as in all Pauline Epistles, based upon faith (observe, withal, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span></span></span>.)!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Pauline faith has always moral practice as its necessary vital activity, and this is consequently always the aim (not: <span class="ital">ultimate</span> aim) of the new creation wrought through faith by means of the Spirit. We may add that the good works, even at our passage,—where, moreover, they are traced back wholly to God as the author,—are so far from being the condition of justification, that, on the contrary, the dogmatic canon here receives full confirmation: “<span class="ital">Bona opera non praecedunt justificandum, sed sequuntur justificatum</span>.” Comp.

Aptly does Bengel remark on <span class="greekheb">περιπατ</span>.: “<span class="ital">ambularemus</span>, non <span class="ital">salvaremur</span> aut <span class="ital">viveremus</span>.” The assertion, that here (and in Colossians) much greater importance is ascribed to good works than in the other letters of the apostle (Baur, <span class="ital">neut.

This new creation was <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, so that except by union between Him and us it could not have taken place (<a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>). Also it was <span class="ital">with a view</span> to good works, <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> being used here (much as in <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a>) to express <span class="ital">object; cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 492. We ourselves then having been created anew by God, and good works being the <span class="ital">object</span> to which that new creation looked, not the cause that led to it, all must be of grace not of deeds (<span class="greekheb">ἔργων</span>), and there can be no room for boasting.—<span class="greekheb">οἶς προητοίμασεν ὁ Θεὸς</span>: <span class="ital">which God afore prepared</span>. The <span class="greekheb">οἶς</span> cannot with any propriety be construed as a masc., “for whom He before appointed” (Erasm.); nor can it well be taken as the dat. of destination, “unto which God prepared us” (Luth., Schenkel, etc.); for that would require the insertion of a <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>. Nor, again, can it be taken in the intrans. sense, so as to give the idea “for which God made previous preparation” (Stier); for while <span class="greekheb">ἑτοιμάζειν</span> <span class="ital">may</span> be used intransitively (<a href="/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>), the compound verb does not appear to be so used. It is best taken (with the Syr., Goth. and Vulg. Versions and the best exegetes) as a case of attraction—<span class="greekheb">οἵς</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">προετοιμάζειν</span> is not quite the same as <span class="greekheb">προορίζειν</span>. It means to <span class="ital">prepare</span> or <span class="ital">place in readiness before</span>, not specifically to <span class="ital">foreordain</span> (Aug., Harl.). The <span class="greekheb">προ</span>- describes the <span class="ital">preparation</span> as prior to the <span class="ital">creation</span> (<span class="greekheb">κτισθέντες</span>). The subjects of the preparation also are the <span class="ital">good works themselves</span>, not the <span class="ital">ways</span> in which they are to be done. In relation to the question of human merit or glorying, therefore, good works are viewed in two distinct aspects. They are the goal to which God’s new creation of us looked; they are also in God’s eternal plan. Before He created us in Christ by our conversion He had destined these good works and made them ready for us in His purpose and decree. There is the unseen source from which they spring, and there is their final explanation.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐν αὐτοῖς περιπατήσωμεν</span>: <span class="ital">that we should walk in them</span>. God’s purpose in the place which He gave to good works in His decree was that they should actually and habitually be done by us. His final object was to make good works the very element of our life, the domain in which our action should move. That this should be the nature of our walk is implied in our being His handiwork, made anew by Him in Christ; that the good works which form the Divine aim of our life shall be realised is implied in their being designed and made ready for us in God’s decree; and that they are of God’s originating, and not of our own action and merit, is implied in the fact that we had ourselves to be made a new creation in Christ with a view to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>, &c.] The connexion is, “works are not the antecedent, but the consequent, of your acceptance in Christ; <span class="ital">for</span> the true statement of the case is, that you were re-made, re-born, <span class="ital">in order to</span> work the will of God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his</span>] Strongly emphatic. “It is He that made us, and not we ourselves” (<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm" title="Know you that the LORD he is God: it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.">Psalm 100:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">workmanship</span>] Better, <span class="bld">making</span>.

The noun does not necessarily give the precise idea of a new “creation;” it may mean only an appointment to position. But the two, as a fact, coincide in this matter.—In <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a> (its only other place in N.T.) the word is used of God’s handiworks in nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">created</span>] A frequent word, in spiritual connexions, with St Paul.

As in the sphere of nature, so in that of grace, it means essentially the making of a new state of things, whether in a Universe or a personality; implying indeed the omnipotence which originally willed the very material into existence, but not necessarily dwelling on this; rather giving the thought of first, or new, <span class="ital">arrangement</span>.—In practice, the thought of the <span class="ital">sovereignty of the Worker’s will</span> lies in the use of the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Christ Jesus</span>] The third occurrence of these words within five verses.—The Church was “<span class="ital">created in</span>” Him, in that its very existence as such depends on vital union with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto good works</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">upon good works</span>,” i.e., as interpreted by usage, “with a view to them.” The same construction and meaning appear <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a> (A.V., “<span class="ital">unto</span> uncleanness); <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a> (A.V., “<span class="ital">to</span> the subverting”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath before ordained</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">did prepare beforehand</span>; on the ideal <span class="ital">occasion</span> of His planning the salvation and the function of His true Church. The phrase does not state, but surely implies, the happy truth that the Divine pre-arrangement so maps out, as it were, the duties and the sufferings of the saint that his truest wisdom and deepest peace is to “do the next thing” in the daily path, in the persuasion that it is part of a consistent plan for him.

We have to be fashioned anew by God before we can do anything aright (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). Anything right in us is not the cause of grace, but its fruit. There seems to be no special reason for the change from the second to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">Created in Christ Jesus for good works.</span> So little inward capacity had we for such works, that we required to be created in Christ Jesus in order that we might do them. The inward new birth of the soul is indicated. When good works were required, this gracious change had to be wrought to secure them. The purpose of the new creation is to produce them. Christ "gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people of his own, zealous of good works." It is not good works first, and grace after; but grace first, and good works after (see <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</span> A further proof of the true origin of good works. They are the subjects of a Divine decree. Before the foundation of the world it was ordained that whoever should be saved by grace should walk in good works. The term "<span class="accented">walk</span>," here denotes the habitual tenor of the life; it is to be spent in an atmosphere of good works. Here we have one of the Divine safeguards against the abuse of the doctrine of salvation by grace. When men hear of salvation irrespective of works, they are apt to fancy that works are of little use, and do not need to be carefully attended to. On the contrary, they are part of the Divine decree, and if we are not living a life of good works, we have no reason to believe that we have been saved by grace. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For we are His workmanship<p>A reason why no man should glory.
