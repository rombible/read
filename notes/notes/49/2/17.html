<a href="/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>; <a href="/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>). But we note that at that very time He repeated the salutation “Peace be unto you,” with the expressive addition, “As my Father hath sent Me, even so send I you,” and with the charge, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost,” for the future mission “to remit or retain sins.” In the same connection we have in <a href="/context/john/14-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.">John 14:25-28</a>, the promise of the Comforter, and the words “Peace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you. . . . I go away and come again to you.” Hence we cannot limit His “coming” to the appearance after the Resurrection. At all times through the witness of the Holy Spirit, whether with or without the preaching of His servants (<a href="/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>), He “stands at the door and knocks” (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>) with the message of peace.

The passage is a quotation from <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son.

"He came" of His own free love, and "announced peace" with His own mouth to the apostles (Lu 24:36; Joh 20:19, 21, 26); and by them to others, through His Spirit present in His Church (Joh 14:18).

After Christ has established peace, He has come and has also <span class="ital">proclaimed</span> it, to the Gentiles and the Jews. This proclamation, namely, cannot be regarded as <span class="ital">preceding</span> the fact by which the peace was established, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐλθών</span> would apply to the <span class="ital">bodily advent of Christ upon earth</span> (Chrysostom, Anselm, Estius, Holzhausen, Matthies, Harless), and the connection with <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a> would be: “Christ is peace in <span class="ital">deed</span> (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and <span class="ital">word</span> (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>); He not only <span class="ital">is</span> peace, but He <span class="ital">proclaimed</span> it Himself at His appearing on earth,” Harless. For, when it is said in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστιν ἡ εἰρήνη ἡμῶν</span>, the time thought of is, as <a href="/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-16</a> show, the time <span class="ital">after the crucifixion of Christ</span>, through which and since which He is our peace, so that <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐλθὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. does not merely attach itself to <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστιν ἡ εἰρήνη ἡμῶν</span> and leave all that intervenes out of view; but, on the contrary, this intervening matter is so essentially bound up with <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ εἰρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>., that now <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐλθὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. can introduce not a <span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>, but only a <span class="greekheb">ὕστερον</span> of the crucifixion, annexing as it does the <span class="ital">further</span> course of the matter. Rightly, therefore, most expositors have understood in <span class="greekheb">ἐλθών</span> an advent <span class="ital">following the crucifixion of Christ</span>, in connection with which either the <span class="ital">resurrection</span> of Christ has been thought of (Bengel, Rückert), or His having come <span class="ital">in His Spirit</span> (Olshausen), or in the preaching that took place through <span class="ital">the apostles</span> (so most), in which latter view <span class="greekheb">ἐλθών</span> is wrongly by many, as Raphel, Grotius, Wolf, Zachariae, Koppe, Rosenmüller (comp. Meier), regarded as without significance; it is in truth an “insigne verbum,” Bengel. The correct explanation (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) is given by Olshausen; comp. Baumgarten-Crusius and de Wette, also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 475, and Bleek. In the Holy Spirit, namely, not only according to John (<a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>), but also according to Paul, <span class="ital">Christ Himself</span> has come (in so far as it is <span class="ital">Christ’s</span> Spirit) from heaven to those who have received the Spirit, and dwells and rules in them (<a href="/context/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), and this <span class="ital">proclamation</span> has taken place at the instance of the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>), and through the Spirit Himself (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a>; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>). The <span class="ital">point of time</span> expressed by <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγελίσατο</span> is the <span class="ital">conversion</span> of the persons concerned, at which they received the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>). Accordingly the apostle could, without writing at variance with history, name first the readers as original Gentiles (<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς μακράν</span>), and then the Jews; for when the Ephesians became Christians, there had already long since been converted not merely <span class="ital">Jews</span>, but Gentiles <span class="ital">and</span> Jews. Had he, on the other hand, meant the actual coming of Christ upon earth and His oral preaching, the historical necessity would have presented itself of mentioning <span class="ital">first</span> those that were near and <span class="ital">then</span> those that were afar off.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may add that the concrete and vividly depicting expression <span class="greekheb">ἐλθὼν εὐηγγ</span>., can the less occasion surprise, as the whole passage bears the impress of emotion. Comp. also <a href="/acts/26-23.htm" title="That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.">Acts 26:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην</span>] has been, from the time of Chrysostom, ordinarily explained of peace <span class="ital">with God</span>, while only a few, as Estius and Koppe, suppose peace <span class="ital">with each other</span> to be <span class="ital">included</span>; but Olshausen rightly understands the latter <span class="ital">alone</span>, as does also Bleek. Only this is in keeping with the whole connection (see, moreover, the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἔχθραν</span>, and comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>), and, moreover, has <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a> not against it, but in its favour (see on <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς μακράν</span> and <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἐγγύς</span>] (both to be explained in accordance with <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>, and comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>) are dependent on <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγελίσατο</span>,—the view which immediately and most naturally suggests itself. Harless would attach both very closely to <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην</span>,—a course to which he was impelled by his explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἐλθὼν εὐηγγ</span>., in order not to present the apostle as saying what is inconsistent with history (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm" title="But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 15:24</a>, comp. <a href="/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:">Matthew 10:5</a> f.; <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-43.htm" title="Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.">Matthew 21:43</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>). But the inconsistency with history would still remain.[156]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">repetition</span> of <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην</span> (see the critical remarks) has rhetorical emphasis, <a href="/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you.

This <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμονή</span> of the expression, however (Nägelsbach on Hom. <span class="ital">Il.</span> i. 436), excludes the view of Wieseler, p. 444, that <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἐγγύς</span> also is in apposition to <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, and means specially the Jewish-Christians in <span class="ital">Ephesus</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[156] If Paul had understood <span class="greekheb">ἐλθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγ</span>. in the sense of Harless, he must at all events have written <span class="greekheb">εἰρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἐγγὺς κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς μακράν</span>. Harless himself has paraphrased (comp. Erasm. <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.): “The contents of his message was a peace which availed for all, <span class="ital">Jews as well as Gentiles</span>.” Evidently under an involuntary sense of the historical relation, but in opposition to the words, according to which Harless ought to have paraphrased: “availed for all, <span class="ital">Gentiles as well as Jews</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐλθὼν εὐηγγελίσατο εἰρήνην ὑμῖν τοῖς μακρὰν καὶ εἰρήνην τοῖς ἐγγύς</span>: <span class="ital">and He came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh</span>. The TR reads simply <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῖς ἐγγύς</span> (with [168] [169], the mass of cursives, the Syr., etc.). The primary uncials and other important authorities ([170] [171] [172] [173] 17, Vulg., etc.) insert <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην</span> (so LTTrWHRV). The repetition has rhetorical force. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, again, does not merely connect this statement with the former. It adds to the thought. Not only did Christ effect the reconciliation, but He also came and preached the glad tidings of it, and that not to one class but to both. The aor. partic. has probably its proper force of <span class="ital">priority</span> in relation to the def. aor. <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγελίσατο</span>. The <span class="ital">coming</span> in question preceded the preaching. The best rendering, therefore, will be neither “coming” (Eadie), nor “came and preached” (AV and RV), but “having come” (Mey., Ell., etc.). But to what <span class="ital">coming</span> does the <span class="greekheb">ἐλθών</span> refer? Not to the <span class="ital">incarnation</span> (Chrys., Anselm, Harl., etc.); for the preceding sentences, which speak of His blood and of the peace effected through His cross, make it clear that the time in view is not before the crucifixion but <span class="ital">after</span> it. Nor can the reference well be to the event of His Resurrection, nor even to His own direct teaching during the forty days (Beng.). What is in view is rather His coming in His Spirit (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>; <a href="/acts/26-23.htm" title="That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.">Acts 26:23</a>, etc.). That the idea of His spiritual Advent in the Holy Ghost which is prominent in the Fourth Gospel is not a Johannine idea only, but one entirely consistent with Paul’s teaching, appears from the Pauline doctrine of the dwelling of Christ Himself or His Spirit in the believer (<a href="/context/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his....">Romans 8:9-10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2 Corinthians 12:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

Those “afar off” are mentioned first, as the Gentiles in the persons of these Ephesians and other Asiatics were the writer’s immediate concern.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[168] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[169] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[172] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

It cannot denote what Christ did personally, but what he did by sending his Spirit to the apostles and other early preachers. It was only after the cross and after the resurrection that peace could be proclaimed on the footing of faith in a Savior who had died and was alive. And only in the sense of having sent his preachers and given them his Spirit could Jesus be said to have preached to the Ephesians. The repetition of the word "peace" in the R.V. is expressive; if the subject had been merely peace between the two classes of men, we should not have had the repetition; the repetition denotes peace between each of the two classes and a third party, viz. God. It is remarkable that the Gentiles, "those that were far off," are mentioned here before the Jews, "those that were nigh." In point of chronology, the Jews came first; but the order is here transposed, probably to emphasize the offer of the gospel to the Gentiles, and to show that spiritually they were as near as the Jews. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>You which were afar off<p>Gentiles.<p>Them that were nigh<p>Jews.
