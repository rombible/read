On the mention of this he runs on, in the fulness of his heart, into a flow of thought concerning the glory of Christ’s exaltation, in the three following verses. He here resumes the thread of his discourse. <span class="ital">You hath he quickened </span>— Or, (as these words are not in the original,) if we connect this verse with the last clause of the preceding chapter, we may read, <span class="ital">you hath he filled, </span>namely, with his gifts and graces, and thereby hath made you alive to himself; <span class="ital">who were dead </span>— Not only diseased, but dead; absolutely devoid of all spiritual life, and as incapable of quickening yourselves, as persons literally dead are of restoring their bodies to life. In this sense Locke paraphrases the words: “Ye were so entirely under the power of sin, that ye had no more power, nor hope, nor ability, to get out of it, than men dead and buried have to get out of their graves.” The truth is, unawakened, impenitent, and unbelieving sinners, are dead in three respects; 1st, They are under condemnation, on account of their past depravity and various transgressions, to the second death, or to future wrath and punishment, like criminals under sentence of death for their crimes. 2d, They are destitute of all union with God, and in a state of separation from him, and alienation from his life, chap. <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. 3d, They are <span class="ital">carnally minded; </span>that is, their thoughts and affections are set upon visible and temporal things, <span class="ital">which is </span>spiritual <span class="ital">death, </span>(<a href="/romans/8-6.htm" title="For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.">Romans 8:6</a>,) implying deadness or aversion to spiritual and divine things. <span class="ital">In trespasses and sins — Sins </span>seem to be spoken chiefly of the Gentiles who knew not God; <span class="ital">trespasses </span>of the Jews, who had his law, and yet regarded it not. Or the expressions may be used indiscriminately, without any such distinction being intended; for all <span class="ital">trespasses </span>are <span class="ital">sins, </span>and all <span class="ital">sins </span>are <span class="ital">trespasses, </span>properly speaking. <span class="ital">Wherein in time past ye walked</span> — <span class="greekheb">Περιεπατησατε</span>, <span class="ital">ye walked about, </span>or <span class="ital">walked continually. </span>For, as Grotius observes, the word <span class="ital">significat consuetudinem, </span>implies <span class="ital">custom, </span>or <span class="ital">habit. According to the course of this world </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κατα τον αιωνα</span>, <span class="ital">according to the age, </span>or the common usage of the age in which you lived, and to those corrupt principles and practices which prevailed around you. The word above mentioned, translated <span class="ital">course, </span>properly means along series of times, wherein one corrupt age follows another. <span class="ital">The prince of the power of the air </span>— “That wicked spirit, who commands the legions of fallen angels, that by divine permission range in the air, and fly from place to place, in pursuit of their pernicious purpose of corrupting and destroying mankind.” So Dr. Doddridge, who observes, “This refers to a Jewish tradition, that the air is inhabited by evil spirits, a notion which the apostle seems to approve.” Macknight’s interpretation of the passage is nearly the same, as follows: <span class="ital">“Power, </span>being here put for those who exercise power, (as it is likewise chap. <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>, and <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>,) signifies those powerful evil spirits, whose confinement [mentioned by Jude, <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>] is not of such a nature as to hinder them from going to and fro on the earth. And therefore, being irreconcilable enemies of God and goodness, they use the liberty granted to them in opposing God, and in ruining men by their temptations, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1 Peter 5:8</a>. And that they may do this the more effectually, they have ranged themselves under the direction of one chief, here called their <span class="ital">prince; </span>but in other passages <span class="ital">Satan, </span>and <span class="ital">the devil. </span>Perhaps also he is called their <span class="ital">prince, </span>because he instigated them to rebel against God, and was their leader in that rebellion. See <a href="/1_john/5-19.htm" title="And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.">1 John 5:19</a>.” To these quotations we may add, with Bengelius, “A power this the effect of which all may perceive, though all do not understand the cause of it; a power unspeakably penetrating and widely diffused, but yet, as to its baleful influences, beneath the orb of believers.” <span class="ital">The spirit that now worketh </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ενεργουντος</span>, <span class="ital">worketh inwardly with energy. </span>So he did, and so he doth work in all ages; <span class="ital">in the children of disobedience </span>— In all that disbelieve and disobey the gospel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And you hath he quickened - The words "hath he quickened," or "made to live," are supplied, but not improperly, by our translators. The object of the apostle is to show the great power which God had evinced toward the people <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>; and to show that this was put forth in connection with the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and his exaltation to the right hand of God in heaven; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>. The words "hath he quickened" mean, hath he made alive, or made to live; <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>; <a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-36.htm">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>.<p>Who were dead in trespasses and sins - On the meaning of the word "dead," see the notes at <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>, note. It is affirmed here of those to whom Paul wrote at Ephesus, that before they were converted, they were "dead in sins." There is not anywhere a more explicit proof of depravity than this, and no stronger language can be used. They were "dead" in relation to that to which they afterward became alive - i. e., to holiness. Of course, this does not mean that they were in all respects dead. It does not mean that they had no animal life, or that they did not breathe, and walk, and act. Nor can it mean that they had no living intellect or mental powers, which would not have been true. Nor does it settle any question as to their ability or power while in that state. It simply affirms a fact - that in relation to real spiritual life they were, in consequence of sin, like a dead man in regard to the objects which are around him.<p>A corpse is insensible. It sees not, and hears not, and feels not. The sound of music, and the voice of friendship and of alarm, do not arouse it. The rose and the lily breathe forth their fragrance around it, but the corpse perceives it not. The world is busy and active around it, but it is unconscious of it all. It sees no beauty in the landscape; hears not the voice of a friend; looks not upon the glorious sun and stars; and is unaffected by the running stream and the rolling ocean. So with the sinner in regard to the spiritual and eternal world. He sees no beauty in religion; he hears not the call of God; he is unaffected by the dying love of the Saviour; and he has no interest in eternal realities. In all these he feels no more concern, and sees no more beauty, than a dead man does in the world around him. Such is, in "fact," the condition of a sinful world. There is, indeed, life, and energy, and motion. There are vast plans and projects, and the world is intensely active. But in regard to religion, all is dead. The sinner sees no beauty there; and no human power can arouse him to act for God, anymore than human power can rouse the sleeping dead, or open the sightless eyeballs on the light of day. The same power is needed in the conversion of a sinner which is needed in raising the dead; and one and the other alike demonstrate the omnipotence of him who can do it.  <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Eph 2:1-22.

All three, too, take seriously from the point and power of the closing verses of chapter 1, which are given in a strain of lofty and majestic affirmation suitable to the winding up of a great argument. We have, therefore, a new section here, in which a particular application is made of what has been affirmed in the preceding paragraph. These first ten verses speak of a further manifestation of that power of God which was seen in the resurrection and exaltation of Christ, namely, in the raising of the Ephesians themselves from the death of sin into a new life unto God, and that not of works but of grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Chapter <a href="/context/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;...">Ephesians 2:1-10</a>.

V.); the Gr. verb in <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a> being the aorist. Ideally, in their slain and risen Lord’s triumph, actually, in their spiritual regeneration, “believing on His name,” they had definitely received “eternal life.”—The English reader will remember that in the A. V. “to quicken” means seldom if ever to excite what already lives, but to bring from death to life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe here the great theme of the Church and its Head treated in the special aspect of entrance into the Body by Divine regeneration of persons. For close parallels, though they treat the matter more from the side of Christ’s atoning work, cp. <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>; passages which, if written shortly before this, may have suggested the form of the opening phrase of this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who were dead</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">being dead</span>, “when you were dead;” devoid of spiritual and eternal life; see the next words. Obviously this weighty phrase needs to be read in the light of other truths; such as the existence of <span class="ital">spirit</span>, and the full presence of conscience, and of accountability, in the unregenerate. But those truths must not be allowed unduly to tone down this statement, which distinctly teaches that the state of the unregenerate has a true analogy to physical death; and that that analogy on the whole consists in this, that (1) it is a state in which a living principle, necessary for organization, growth and energy, in reference to God and holiness, is entirely lacking; (2) it is a state which has no innate tendency to develope such a principle of life. The principle must come to it altogether <span class="ital">ab extra</span>.—The latest researches into nature confirm the conviction that <span class="ital">dead matter</span> has absolutely no inner tendency to generate life, which must come into it <span class="ital">ab extra</span> if it is to live; a suggestive analogy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the doctrine of spiritual death as the state of unregenerate man, cp. ch. <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother stays in death.">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-12.htm" title="He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.">1 John 5:12</a>; and see <a href="/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>. There are passages where “death” is used as a strong term to denote a <span class="ital">comparatively</span> lifeless state of the regenerate soul, needing (if it is to be escaped) not new birth, which is a thing once accomplished, but revival. But this modified sense of “death” must not be allowed to lower the absolute sense in a passage like this, with its peculiar doctrinal emphasis on the contrast of death and life. The state here described is not one of suppressed life, but of absence of life. Cp. <a href="/1_timothy/5-6.htm" title="But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>, sometimes quoted of spiritual death, is not in point: translate, “then did all die,” and interpret of the death, representatively in Christ, of “all” at Calvary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in trespasses and sins</span>] Better, <span class="bld">in respect of your trespasses</span>, &c.—The Gr. construction is the dative without the preposition “in,” (so <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>); and indicates conditioning circumstances.—What is the distinction between “trespass” and “sin”? It has been held that “trespass” is more of the conception, and “sin” of the act; or again that “trespass” is more of omission, “sin” of commission. But usage forbids any certainty in such inferences. In <a href="/ezekiel/18-26.htm" title="When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.">Ezekiel 18:26</a> the LXX. use the word <span class="ital">paraptôma</span> (trespass) of the sin which the “righteous” commits and in which he dies. Etymologically, it is a <span class="ital">fall over;</span> and this may be either over a pebble or over a precipice. In actual usage, however, there is a slight occasional tendency in “trespass” towards a mitigated idea of sin, a “fault,” as in <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>; and it is possible that we have this here; as if to say, “in every form of evil-doing, whether lighter (trespasses) or heavier (sins).” But it is more probable still that the phrase is used designedly for accumulation’s sake alone, without precise distinction; as if to say, “evil-doing, however described.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See Abp.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1f00;&#x3c2;</span> is not governed by any verb going before; it manifestly depends on the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 5, but it is separated from it by a new digression (vers. 2, 3), on which the apostle immediately starts. While the same quickening power of God was exerted on Christ and on the Ephesians, it was exerted to very different effects: in the case of Christ, raising him literally from the dead and exalting him to heavenly glory; in the case of the Ephesians, raising them from spiritual death and exalting them to high spiritual privileges. We may observe the change from the second to the first person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, in this chapter as in <a href="/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1</a>. Second person (vers. 1, 8, 11); first (vers. 3, 10, 14); and the two streams brought together (ver. 18). The chapter closes beautifully with an emblem of the Church as the one temple of which <span class="accented">all</span> believers are parts. The <span class="accented">death</span> ascribed to the Ephesians in their natural state is evidently <span class="accented">spiritual</span> death, and "trespasses and sins," being in the dative (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), seems to indicate the cause of death - "dead through your trespasses and your sins" (R.V.); "dead <span class="accented">of</span> your trespasses," etc., is suggested by Alford. It is not easy to assign a different meaning to the two nouns here; some suggest <span class="accented">acts</span> of transgression for the one, and sinful tendencies or principles for the other, but this distinction cannot be carried out in all other passages. The killing effect of sin is indicated. As sins of sensuality kill truthfulness, industry, integrity, and all virtue, so sin generally, affecting as it does our whole nature, kills, or does not suffer to live, the affections and movements of the spiritual life. A state of "death" implies previous life - the <span class="accented">race</span> lived before; it implies also a state of insensibility, of utter powerlessness and helplessness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And you<p>Taking up the closing thought of the preceding chapter, the magnitude of God's power toward believers as exhibited in Christ's resurrection.
