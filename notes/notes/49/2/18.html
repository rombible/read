In the original the order is emphatic: “Through Him we have the access, both of us in one Spirit, to the Father.” The greater idea of access to God is still prominent; but the lesser idea of union with each other in that access is still traceable as an undertone. “Access” is properly “the introduction” (used also in <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>), a technical word of presentation to a royal presence. So says Chrysostom, “We came not of ourselves, but He brought us in.” The corresponding verb is found in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>, “Christ also suffered for sins—the just for the unjust—that He might <span class= "ital">bring us to God.”</span> It will be noted that we have here one of the implicit declarations of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, so frequent in this Epistle. The unity of the whole Church, as united “to the Father,” “through the Son,” and “in the Spirit,” is here summed up in one sentence, but with as much perfection and clearness as even when it is unfolded in the great passage below (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>). The ultimate source of all doctrine on the subject is necessarily in the words of the Lord Himself. (See John 14-17, especially <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23-25</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/context/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13-15</a>; <a href="/context/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20-21</a>.)

Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For through him - That is, he has secured this result that we have access to God.

The oneness of "the Spirit," through which we both have our access, is necessarily followed by oneness of the body, the Church (Eph 2:16). The distinctness of persons in the Divine Trinity appears in this verse. It is also fatal to the theory of sacerdotal priests in the Gospel through whom alone the people can approach God.

According to Harless, the <span class="ital">truth of that proclamation</span> is shown from the <span class="ital">reality of the possession</span>. But in this way a subsidiary thought (namely, that the proclamation was <span class="ital">true</span>) is introduced not merely arbitrarily, but also unsuitably (for the <span class="ital">truth</span> of that which has been proclaimed was self-evident).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν προσαγωγήν</span>] Christ is not conceived of as <span class="ital">door</span> (<a href="/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>; Beza, Calvin), which is remote from the context, but as <span class="ital">bringer;</span> in which case there may be an allusion to the Oriental custom of getting access to the king only through a <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγεύς</span> (see on <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>), but not to <span class="ital">sacrificial processions</span> in accordance with Herod. ii. 58 (Meier), which would be an unsuitable comparison. Before Christ had reconciled men with God, communion with God was, on account of the wrath of God (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="/romans/5-10.htm" title="For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.">Romans 5:10</a>), denied to them; Christ by His <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> removed this obstacle, and thus became the <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγεύς</span>, through the mediation of whom (<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>) we now and henceforth have the <span class="ital">bringing near</span> (Thuc. i. 82; Polyb. ix. 41. 1, xii. 4. 10; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr.</span> vii. 5. 45) unto God. In substance the having the <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγή</span> to God is not different from the <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span> (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>), and from the filial relationship of the reconciled. It is the consequence of the atoning death of Jesus; the peaceful relation of believers towards God, brought about through this death.

Here, moreover, as at <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>, the notion of <span class="ital">bringing towards</span>, which the word has, is not to be interchanged with that of <span class="ital">approach</span> or <span class="ital">access</span> (as still by Rückert, Harless, Bleek), as though <span class="greekheb">πρόσοδον</span> were written in the text.

The referring of it to the <span class="ital">human</span> spirit (<span class="greekheb">ὁμοθυμαδόν</span>, Anselm, Homberg, Zachariae, Koppe, Morus, Rosenmüller) ought to have been precluded by taking note of the Divine <span class="ital">Trias</span> in our passage (<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν πατέρα</span>); comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, further, the difference of meaning between the <span class="greekheb">ἔχομεν</span> (denoting the continuously present possession of the signal benefit) and the <span class="greekheb">ἐσχήκαμεν</span> of <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a> (see on the latter passage).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι διʼ αὐτοῦ ἔχομεν τὴν προσαγωγὴν οἱ ἀμφότεροι ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα</span>: <span class="ital">for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father</span>.

But the subject of the preaching has already been given, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>. Hence <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>=<span class="ital">for</span>, and the verse is a confirmation of the previous statement in the form of an appeal to the experience of those addressed. The fact that we, both of us, are now brought to God through Him is a witness to the truth of what I have just said, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that Christ came and preached peace to both. The privilege referred to is a present and continuing privilege (<span class="greekheb">ἔχομεν</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἐσχήκαμεν</span> as in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>)—one to which effect is being given now, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν προσαγωγήν</span>, “the introduction,” or “<span class="ital">our</span> introduction”. This noun denotes, properly speaking, the <span class="ital">Acts of bringing to one</span>, and then the <span class="ital">approach</span> or <span class="ital">access</span> (Herod., ii., 58; Xen., <span class="ital">Cyr.</span>, vii., 5, 45). It is urged by some (Mey., Ell., etc.) that both here and in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a> it has the primary <span class="ital">trans</span>. sense, and denotes the privilege of being <span class="ital">brought</span> to God or <span class="ital">introduced</span> to Him. Christ would thus be presented in the character of “Bringer,” perhaps with some allusion to the office of the <span class="greekheb">προσαγωγεύς</span> through whom in Oriental courts one was brought into the royal presence. But the difference in idea between <span class="ital">access</span> (<span class="greekheb">πρόσοδος</span>) and “admission” (Ell.) or “bringing” (<span class="greekheb">προσαγωγή</span>) is slight, and there seems sufficient justification for the <span class="ital">intrans.</span> sense. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι</span>, which is strangely taken by some (Anselm, Rosenm.) as = <span class="greekheb">ὁμοθυμαδόν</span>, “with one mind,” obviously refers to the Holy Ghost. That is made clear both by the mention of the <span class="ital">coming</span> and <span class="ital">preaching</span> in the Spirit, and by the reference both to <span class="ital">Christ</span> and to the <span class="ital">Father</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not = <span class="ital">by</span>, but <span class="ital">in</span>, with reference to the <span class="ital">element</span> in which alone we have the access. As that right is ours only <span class="ital">through</span> Christ (<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>), so it is made ours in actual experience only <span class="ital">in</span> the Spirit, and Jew and Gentile have it alike because it is one and the same Spirit that works in both. So both have continuous access to God from whom once they were far removed, to Him, too, in the benign character of the <span class="ital">Father</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸν πατέρα</span>) whom they can approach without fear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">for</span>] It is possible to render “<span class="ital">that</span>,” and so to make this the substance of the message of “peace.” The difference is not important.

We are, thanks be to God, evermore free to and in His presence-chamber, but we are also evermore free there “<span class="ital">through</span> His Son,” Who “<span class="ital">ever liveth to make intercession</span> for us.”—The word occurs elsewhere <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>; and below, <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by one Spirit</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">in one Spirit</span>; surrounded, animated, penetrated, by the Spirit. This is undoubtedly the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, so largely in view in this Epistle.

This profound word, rich in life, love, and joy, was indeed a new treasure, in its Christian sense, to “them that were afar off.” No pagan mythology, or philosophy, though the <span class="ital">word</span> was not unknown to them, knew the <span class="ital">thing;</span> the Divine reality of an eternal and paternal Holy Love. To the Israelite the Lord was indeed known as “like unto a Father pitying his children” (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm" title="Like as a father pities his children, so the LORD pities them that fear him.">Psalm 103:13</a>); “doubtless our Father” (<a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm" title="Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.">Isaiah 63:16</a>); but even to him the word would develope into inexhaustible riches when read in the light of the Sonship of the true Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe that the approach of the soul is here, as always, <span class="ital">ultimately</span> to the Father.

Subject of this verse, access to the Father; predicate, this access effected through Christ by the one Spirit. Our having access to the Father is assumed as a matter of spiritual experience; the converted Ephesians knew that in their prayers and other exercises they did really stand before God, and felt as children to a Father. How came this to pass? "Through him." Sinful men have not this privilege by nature; "Your iniquities have <span class="accented">separated</span> between you and your God" (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). They need a Mediator; Jesus is that Mediator; and through him, both Jews and Gentiles enjoy the privilege. But right of access is not enough; in approaching God and holding fellowship with him there must be some congeniality of soul, a fellow-feeling between God and the worshipper; this is effected through the same Spirit. Some render "in the same spirit, or disposition of mind." This is true, but not all the truth; for the question arises - How do we get this suitable disposition? And the answer is - It is wrought by the Holy Spirit. As the state of the soul in true intercourse with God is substantially the same in all, so it is brought by the same Holy Spirit. In fact, this verse is one of the characteristic texts of Ephesians, in which Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are brought together. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Access (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>.
