All Christians must be saints; if they come not under that character on earth, they will never be saints in glory. Those are not saints, who are not faithful, believing in Christ, and true to the profession they make of relation to their Lord. By grace, understand the free and undeserved love and favour of God, and those graces of the Spirit which come from it; by peace, all other blessings, spiritual and temporal, the fruits of the former. No peace without grace. No peace, nor grace, but from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ; and the best saints need fresh supplies of the graces of the Spirit, and desire to grow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace to you, ... - see the notes, <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is the Christian rendering of the greeting with which letters began. It combines the Greek form with the Hebrew, but translates the <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> of the former into the evangelical <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>. What Paul desires for his readers is the enjoyment of the free, loving favour of God and the peace which results from it. This is the usual form which the opening salutation takes in the Epistles of the NT. So it is in Romans , 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians , 1 and 2 Thessalonians, <a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a> and 2 Peter; as also in <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>. It is not, however, the only form. In James, but only in him, we have the old formula <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> (<a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a>). In 1 and 2 Timothy and 2 John (but not in Titus according to the best reading) it is <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>; and in Jude we find <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The <span class="ital">grace</span> and <span class="ital">peace</span> desired for the readers by the writer are blessings which come only from God the Father and from Christ. The “Lord Jesus Christ” is named along with “God our Father” as the giver of the grace and peace—a collocation impossible except on the supposition that the writer held Christ to be of the same rank with God or in a unique relation to Him. There is a distinction indicated here between God and Jesus Christ. But it is not in what they are able to give; for the gifts of grace and peace come from both. Nor is any distinction suggested here in respect of <span class="ital">nature</span>. But there is a distinction in respect of <span class="ital">relation</span> to believers. To the receivers of grace and peace God is in the relation of <span class="ital">Father</span>; to the same subjects Christ is in the relation of <span class="ital">Lord</span>. God is <span class="ital">Father</span>, having made them His children by adoption. Christ is <span class="ital">Lord</span>, being constituted Head of the Church and having won the right to their loving obedience and honour; <span class="ital">cf.</span> MacP., <span class="ital">in loco,</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Grace</span> be <span class="ital">to you, and peace</span>] So in the opening words of Rom., 1 Cor., 2 Cor., Gal., Phil., Col., 1 Thess., 2 Thess., Philem., 1 Pet., 2 Pet., and Rev. In the Pastoral Epistles, and in 2 John, the remarkable addition “mercy” appears; in Jude, “mercy, peace, and love.” In these salutations, “Grace” is all the free and loving favour of God in its spiritual efficacy; “Peace” is specially the complacency of reconciliation with which He regards His people, but so as to imply also its results <span class="ital">in</span> them; repose, serenity of soul; spiritual happiness, in the largest sense. See further on <a href="/context/ephesians/6-23.htm" title="Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ....">Ephesians 6:23-24</a> below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from God our Father</span>] To St Paul God is the <span class="ital">Pater Noster</span> of Christians, in the inner sense of their union by faith with His Son. The Scriptures, while not ignoring a universal Fatherhood of God towards mankind, always tend to put into the foreground the Fatherhood and Sonship of special connexion; that of covenant, of grace, of faith. Among many leading passages see, in N. T., <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>, &c.; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not....">1 John 3:1-2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> from <span class="ital">the Lord Jesus Christ</span>] He, equally with His Father, is the Giver of eternal blessing, and the Lord of the soul. Incidental phrases of this kind form a testimony to the Proper Deity of the Saviour weightier, if possible, than even that of direct dogmatic passages. They indicate the drift <span class="ital">of the <span class="bld">main current</span></span> of apostolic belief. See further on <a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a> below.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> As in most of Paul's Epistles, "grace" is virtually the first word and the last (<a href="/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>), equivalent to free, undeserved mercy in all its manifold forms and manifestations. This Epistle is so full of the subject, that it has been called "The Epistle of Grace." The apostle dwells more fully on it than even in the Epistle to the Romans, and with a more jubilant sense of its richness and sufficiency. Peace is conjoined with grace; they are like mother and daughter, or like twin sisters. Grace is the only foundation of true peace - whether peace with God, peace of conscience, rest and satisfaction of soul, or peace toward our fellow-men. The source of grace and peace is "God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." The two are always in apposition as the Source of blessing, never in opposition. The notion is eminently unscriptural that the Father personally burned with anger until the Son rushed in to appease; both are in beautiful harmony in the scheme of grace. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son," etc. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Grace<p>One of the leading words of the epistle.
