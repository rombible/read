The word “inheritance” has a correspondent meaning. It is a present possession (as in <a href="/acts/7-5.htm" title="And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.">Acts 7:5</a>), which shall be developed into a more precious future. “We are very members, incorporate in the mystical body of Christ, and also heirs through hope of His everlasting kingdom.”<p><span class= "bld">Until the redemption of the purchased possession.</span>—The “redemption” here is the complete and final salvation from sin and death (as in <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>). The original word here rendered “purchased possession” properly means “the act of purchase or acquisition,” and is so used in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>. But it seems clear that it is here used (in the sense of our version) with that confusion of idea, common in English, though rare in Greek, under which the result of an action is understood instead of the action itself, so that the word “purchases” is used for “things purchased,” “acquisitions” for “things acquired” and the like. The transition is marked in relation to this same word in <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>, where the Israelites are spoken of as “a people for acquisition,” that is, as a people acquired or purchased.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE EARNEST AND THE INHERITANCE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>I have dealt with a portion of this verse in conjunction with the fragment of another in this chapter. I tried to show you how much the idea of the mutual possession of God by the believing soul, and of the believing soul by God, was present to the Apostle’s thoughts in this context. These two ideas are brought into close juxtaposition in the verse before us, for, as you will see if you use the Revised Version, the latter clause is there rightly paraphrased by the addition of a supplement, and reads ‘until the redemption of God’s own possession.’ So that in the first clause we have ‘our inheritance,’ and in the second we have ‘God’s possession.’ This double idea, however, has appended to it in this verse some very striking and important thoughts. The possession of both sides is regarded as incomplete, for what we have is the ‘earnest’ of the ‘inheritance,’ and ‘God’s own possession’ has yet to be ‘redeemed,’ in the fullest sense of that word, at some point in the future. An ‘earnest’ is a fraction of an inheritance, or of a sum hereafter to be paid, and is the guarantee and pledge that the whole shall one day be handed over to the man who has received the foretaste of it in the ‘earnest.’ The soldier’s shilling, the ploughman’s ‘arles,’ the clod of earth and tuft of grass which, in some forms of transfer, were handed over to the purchaser, were all the guarantee that the rest was going to come. So the great future is sealed to us by the small present and the experiences of the Christian life to-day, imperfect, fragmentary, defective as they are, are the best prophecy and the most glorious pledge of that great to-morrow. The same law of continuity which, in application to our characters, and our work, and our daily life, makes ‘to-morrow as this day, and much more abundant,’ in its application to the future life makes the life here its parent, and the life yonder the prolongation and the raising to its highest power, of what is the main though often impeded tendency and direction of the present. The earnest of the ‘inheritance’ is the pledge until the full redemption of ‘God’s own possession.’ I wish, then, to draw attention to these additional thoughts which are here attached to the main idea with which we were dealing in the last sermon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. And I ask you to look with me, first, at the incompleteness of the present possession.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I tried to show in my last sermon how those great thoughts of God’s having us, and our having God, rested upon the three ideas of mutual love, mutual communication, and mutual indwelling. On His side the love, the impartation, the indwelling, are all perfect. On our side they are incomplete, broken, defective; and, therefore, the incompleteness on our side hinders both God’s possession of us, and our possession of Him; so that we have but the ‘earnest’ and not the ‘inheritance.’ That is to say, the ownership may be perfect in idea, but in realisation it is imperfect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then, if we turn to the word in the other clause, ‘the redemption of the purchased possession,’ that suggests the incompleteness with which God as yet owns us. For though the initial act of redeeming is complete, yet redemption is a process, and not an act. And we ‘are having’ it, as the Apostle says in another place very emphatically, in continual and growing experience. The estate has been acquired, but has not yet been fully subdued. For there are tribes in the jungles and in the hills who still hold out against the reign of Him who has won it for Himself. And so seeing that the redemption in its fulness is relegated to some point in the future, towards which we are progressively approximating, and seeing that the best that can be said about the Christian experience here is that we have an ‘earnest of the inheritance,’ we must recognise the incompleteness to-day of our possession of God, and of God’s possession of us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is a matter of experience. We know that only too well. ‘I have God’-have I? I have a drop at the bottom of a too often unsteadily held and spilling cup, and the great ocean rolls unfathomable and boundless at my feet. How partial, how fragmentary, how clouded with doubts and blank ignorance, how intermittent, and, alas! rare, is our knowledge of Him. We sometimes go down our streets between tall houses, walking in their shadow, and now and then there is a cross street down which a blaze of sunshine comes, and when we reach it, and the houses fall back, we see the blue beyond. But we go on, and we are in the shadow again. And so our earthly lives are passed, to a large extent, beneath the shade of the grimy buildings that we ourselves have put up, and which shut out heaven from us, and only now and then a slanting beam comes through some opening, and carries wistful thoughts and longings into the Empyrean beyond. And how feeble our faith, and how little of His power comes into our hearts, and how little of the joy of the Lord is realised in our daily experience we all know, and it is sometimes good for us to force ourselves to feel it is but an ‘earnest’ of the ‘inheritance’ that the best of us has.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘God has us.’ Has He? Has He my will, which submits itself, and finds joy in submitting itself, to Him? How many competitors are there for my love which come in in front of Him, and we ‘cannot get at Him for the press’! How many other motives are dominant in our lives, and how often we wrench ourselves away from our submission to Him, and try to set up a little dominion of our own, and say, ‘Our lives are ours; who is lord over us?’ Oh, brethren! we have God if we are Christians at all, and God has us. But alas! surely all honest experience tells us that there are awful gaps in the circle, and that our possession of Him, and His possession of us, are wofully incomplete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, let me remind you that this incompleteness is mainly our own fault. Of course, I know that for the absolute completeness, either of my possession of God or of His of me, I must pass from out this world, and enter upon another stage and manner of being. But it is not being in the flesh, but it is being dominated by the flesh, that is the reason for the incompleteness of our mutual possession. And it is not being in the world, but it is being seduced and tyrannised over by the influx of worldly desires and thoughts, surging into our hearts, that drives God from out of our hearts, and draws us away from the sweet security of being possessed by, and living close to, Him. Death does a great deal for a man in advancing him in the scale of being, and in changing the centre of gravity, as it were, of this life. But there is no reason to believe that anything in death, or beyond it, will so alter the set and direction of his soul as that it will lead him into that possession of God, and being possessed by Him, which he has not here. There are many of us who, if we were to die this instant, would no more have God for ours, or belong to God, than we do now. It is our fault if the circle is broken into so many segments, if the moments of mutual love, communion, and indwelling are so rare and interrupted in our lives. The incompleteness which is due to our earthly condition is nothing as compared with the incompleteness which is due to our own sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this incompleteness is one which may be progressively diminished, and we may be tending moment by moment, and year by year, nearer and nearer, and ever nearer, to the unreachable ideal of the entire possession of, and being possessed by, our God. There is a continual process of redemption of ‘God’s own possession’ going on if a Christian man is true to himself and to that Divine Spirit which is the ‘earnest’ of the ‘inheritance.’ Mark that in my text, as it stands in our Bibles, and reads ‘until the redemption,’ there seems to be merely a pointing onwards to a future epoch, but that, in the more accurate rendering which you will find in the Revised Version, instead of ‘until’ we have ‘unto,’ and that teaches us that the Divine Spirit, which in one aspect is the ‘earnest of the inheritance,’ is also operating upon men’s hearts and minds so as to bring about the gradual completion of the process of redemption.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, dear brethren, seeing that by our own faults the possession is incomplete, and seeing that in the incompleteness there is given to each of us, if we rightly use it, a mighty power which is working ever towards the completion, it becomes us day by day to draw into our spirits more and more of that divine influence, and to let it work more fully upon the sins and faults which, far more than the body of flesh, or the connection with the world which it brings about, are the reasons for the incompleteness of the possession. We have, if we are wise, the task to discharge of daily enclosing, so to speak, more and more of the broad land which is all given over to us for our inheritance, but of which only so much as we fence in and cultivate, and make our own, is our own.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The incompleteness is progressively completed, and it is our work as much as God’s work to complete it. For though in our text that redemption is conceived of as a divine act, it is not an act in which we are but passive. The air goes into the lungs, and that oxygenates the blood, but the lung has to inflate if the air is to penetrate all its vesicles. And so the Spirit which seals us unto the redemption of the possession has to be received, held, diffused throughout, and utilised by our own effort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Now, secondly, notice the certainty of the completion of the incompleteness.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As I have already said, the clod of earth and the handful of grass, the servant’s wages, the soldier’s shilling, are all guarantees that the whole of the inheritance or of the pay will be forthcoming in due time. And so there emerges from this consideration of the Divine Spirit as the ‘earnest,’ the thought that the present experiences of a Christian soul are the surest proofs, and the irrefragable guarantees, of that perfect future. We ask for proofs of a future life. They may be very useful in certain states of mind, and to certain phases of opinion, but as it seems to me, far deeper than the region of logical understanding, and far more conclusive than anything that can be cast into the form of a syllogism, is the experience of a soul which knows that God is its, and that it is God’s. ‘I think, therefore, I am,’ said the philosopher. ‘I have God; therefore I shall always be,’ says the Christian. Whilst that evidence is available only for himself, it is absolutely conclusive for himself. And the fact that it does spring in the hearts which are purest, because nearest God, is no small matter to be considered by men who may be groping for proofs of a life to come. If the selected moments of the purest devotion here on earth bring with them inevitably the confidence of the unending continuance of that communion, then those who do not believe in that future have to account for the fact as best they may. As for us who do know, though brokenly, and by reason of our own faults very imperfectly, what it is to have God, and be had by Him, we do not need to travel out to dim and doubtful analogies, nor do we even depend entirely upon the fact of a risen Christ ascended to the heavens, and living evermore, but we can say, ‘I am God’s; God is mine, and death has no power over such a mutual possession.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The very incompleteness adds strength to the assurance, for the facts of the Christian life are such as to demand, both by its greatness and by its littleness, by its loftiness and by its lapses into lowliness, by the floodtide of devotion that sometimes sweeps rejoicingly over the mud-shoals and by the ebb that sometimes leaves them all black and festering, a future life wherein what was manifestly meant to be, and capable of being, dominant, supreme, but was hampered and hindered here, shall reach its full development, and where the plant that was dwarfed in this alien soil, transplanted into that higher house, shall blossom and bear immortal fruits. The new moon has a ragged edge, and each of the protrusions and concavities are the prophecy of the perfect orb which shall ere long fill the night with calm light from its silvery shield. The incompleteness prophesies completion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And if the incompleteness is so blessed, what will the completeness be? A shilling to a million pounds, Knowledge which is partial and intermittent, like the twilight, as contrasted with the blaze of noonday, Joy like winter sunshine as compared with the warmth and heat of the midday sun at the zenith on the Equator. The ‘earnest’ of the ‘inheritance’ is wealth; the inheritance itself shall be unaccountable treasure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. And so, lastly, a word about the completion of the possession.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘earnest’ is always of the same nature as, and a part of the ‘inheritance.’ Therefore, since the Holy Spirit is the earnest, the conclusion is plain, that the inheritance is nothing less than God Himself. Heaven is to possess God, and to be possessed by Him. That is the highest conception that we can form of that future life. And it is sorely to be lamented that subsidiary conceptions, which are all useful in their subordinate places, have, by popular Christianity, been far too much elevated into being the central blessedness of that future heaven. It is all right that we should cast the things which it is ‘impossible for men to utter’ into the shape of symbols which may a little relieve the necessary inarticulateness; but golden streets, and crystal pavements, and white robes, and golden palms, and all such representations, are but the dimmest shadows of that which they intend to express, and do often, as is the vice of all symbols, obscure. We can only conceive of a condition of which we have had no experience, by the two ways of symbolism and of negation. We can say, ‘There shall be no night there; there shall be no curse there; they need no candle, neither light of the sun; they rest not day nor night; there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.’ But all these negations, like their sister symbols, are but surface work, and we have to go deeper than all of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But to possess God, and to be possessed by Him, and in either case fully, perfectly in degree, progressively in measure, eternal in duration, is the Heaven of heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If that is the true conception of the inheritance, then it follows indubitably that such a Heaven is not for everybody. God would fain have us all for His there, as He would fain have each of us here and now, but it may not be. There are creatures which live beneath stones, and if you turn their coverings up, and let light fall on them, it kills them. And there are men who have refused to belong to God here, and refused to claim their portion in Him, and such cannot possess that true Heaven which is God Himself. Then, if its possession is not a mere matter of divine volition, giving a man what he is not capable of receiving, it plainly follows that the preparation must begin now and here by the incomplete possession of which my text is discoursing. And the way of such preparation is plain. The context says: ‘In whom, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.’ Faith in Jesus Christ, and trust in Him and His work as my forgiveness, my acceptance, my changed nature and heart-is the condition of being ‘sealed’ with that Spirit whose sealing of us is the condition of our love, our surrender, and mutual indwelling, which are our possession of God and being possessed by Him, and are the condition of our future complete possession of the ‘inheritance.’ We must begin with faith in Christ. Then comes the sealing, then comes the earnest, then comes the growing redemption, and in due time shall come the fulness of the possession. ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ’ if thou wouldst have the earnest, whilst thou dost tabernacle in tents in the wilderness of Time, and if thou wouldst have the inheritance when thou crossest the flood into the goodly land.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness.

The incorruptible and never fading one in heaven, or the heavenly kingdom; this is the Father's gift, his bequest, and belongs only to children; it comes to them through the death of the testator, Christ, and is for ever; and of this the Spirit of God is the pledge and earnest: an earnest, is what confirms an agreement, and assures the right to the thing agreed to, and is a part of it, and lesser than it, and is never returned; so the Spirit of God certifies the right to the heavenly inheritance, as well as gives a meetness for it; he is the firstfruits of eternal glory and happiness, and of the same kind with it; and as he is enjoyed in measure by the saints now, is lesser than the communion which they shall have with him, and with the Father, and the Son, hereafter, for the best things are reserved till last; and being once given into the heart as an earnest, he always continues, he never removes more, or is ever taken away: <p>until the redemption of the purchased possession, or "of the peculiar people"; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, for this is not to be understood of heaven, which is never said to be purchased, nor can it with any propriety be said to be redeemed; but of saints, of the church of God, who are bought with a price, and are purchased with his blood; and who, as they were redeemed from sin, Satan, and the law, when they were purchased, so will be redeemed again in the resurrection morn, which is called the day of redemption, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and which will be a redemption of them from the weakness, corruption, and mortality of the body; from their present state of absence and pilgrimage; from the body of sin and death; from all sorrows and afflictions, both inward and outward; from the reproaches and persecutions of men; from a tempting devil, and an unbelieving heart; from all doubts and fears; and from death and the grave; and so the Syriac version very justly renders it, "until the redemption of them that are saved".

He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>. The word <span class="greekheb">ἀρραβών</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἀραβών</span>, the form preferred by Tisch. and regarded by WH as only Western, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">New Testament in Greek</span>, II., App., p. 148) is the LXX reproduction of the Heb. <span class="greekheb">צֲרָבוֹן</span> which occurs in <a href="/context/genesis/38-17.htm" title="And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?...">Genesis 38:17-18</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-20.htm" title="And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.">Genesis 38:20</a> and is rendered “pledge”. It is found in classical Greek of earlier date than the LXX (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Isaeus, <span class="ital">De Cir. her.</span>, 23; Aristotle, <span class="ital">Pol.</span>, i., 11; Menander, <span class="ital">Frag. Com.</span> (Meineke), iv., pp. 268, 283; etc., <span class="ital">cf.</span> Light., <span class="ital">Notes, ut sup.</span>, p. 323), and is supposed, therefore, to have come from the Phœnicians into Greek use. At an early date it was introduced also into Latin, but by what channel we know not. In Latin it occurs in the three forms-<span class="ital">arrabo, rabo</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Plautus, <span class="ital">Truc.</span>, iii., 20), and <span class="ital">arra</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Aul. Gell., xvii., 2). It survives in the forms <span class="ital">arra, arrhes</span> in the languages most directly derived from the Latin; as also in our <span class="ital">arles</span>, the obsolete English <span class="ital">earlespenny</span>, etc. Etymologically, it appears to have expressed the idea of <span class="ital">exchange</span>, and so its primary sense may have been that of a “pledge” simply. But it came to mean more than <span class="greekheb">ἐνέχυρον</span>, or <span class="ital">pledge</span>, in the sense of something exchanged between two parties to a contract or agreement. Its proper sense is that of <span class="ital">earnest</span>—part of the price to be received or part of the thing that is to be possessed, given in assurance that the full payment or the complete possession will follow. Wycl. gives “ernes”; the Rhemish, “pledge”; Tynd., Cran., and the Genevan, “earnest”. The idea is similar to that elsewhere expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span>, “first-fruits” (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>). The “earnest of the Spirit” is mentioned by itself in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>, as here, it is introduced along with the <span class="ital">sealing</span> of the Spirit. To the truth expressed by the latter it adds the higher idea that the believer possesses already in reality, though but in part, the life of the future; the inheritance of the present and the inheritance of the future differing not in kind but only in degree, so that even now we have the life and blessedness of the future in the way of foretaste. It is doubtful whether the term is also meant to suggest the idea of <span class="ital">obligation</span> on the believer’s side, as Light. thinks, who takes it to intimate that “the Spirit has, as it were, a lien upon us”.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν</span>: <span class="ital">unto the redemption</span>. The “unto” of the RV is to be preferred to the “until” of the AV. The clause is to be connected not with the <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν ἀρραβών</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but with the main statement, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἐσφραγίσθητε</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> expresses not the idea of <span class="ital">time</span> but that of <span class="ital">purpose</span>. It is the first of two purposes which God is here declared to have had in <span class="ital">sealing</span> them. In that operation of His grace God had it in view to make them certain of the complete redemption which was to come at the consummation of the Kingdom of God. The <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> here, as the tenor of the passage plainly indicates, is the final, perfected redemption, as in <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>, and probably <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς περιποιήσεως</span>: <span class="ital">of the possession</span>. The “<span class="ital">purchased</span> possession” of the AV is less apt, as the verb <span class="greekheb">περιποιεῖσθαι</span> expresses the general idea of <span class="ital">preserving, acquiring, gaining for oneself</span>, without specific reference to a <span class="ital">price</span>. But what is the import of the phrase here? The form of the noun <span class="greekheb">περιποίησις</span> and its use point to the active sense, <span class="ital">preserving, acquiring</span>. In <a href="/2_chronicles/14-13.htm" title="And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.">2 Chronicles 14:13</a> it is said of the Ethiopians that they fell <span class="greekheb">ὥστε μὴ εἶναι ἐν αὐτοῖς περιποίησιν</span>, so “that they could not recover themselves” (RV text), or, “so that none remained alive” (RV marg.). The word occurs in the NT five times in all (<a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>). In three of these instances it certainly has the active sense (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σωτηρίας</span>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>, <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span>; <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>, <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ψυχῆς</span>), and it would be most natural to take it in that sense here. But it is difficult to adjust that to the genitive case dependent on the <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσιν</span>. The most plausible rendering on that view is that proposed by Abbott, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, “a complete redemption which <span class="ital">will give possession</span>”. The noun may be taken, however, in the passive sense, and a more natural meaning results. Some then understand it of the inheritance we are to possess. So Aug. and Calv. make it = <span class="ital">haereditas acquisita</span>; Matthies, “the promised glorious possession”; Bleek, “the redemption which is to become our possession”. So, too, Macpherson takes the “possession” to be the “inheritance of the saints” here, as he takes the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐκληρώθημεν</span> to mean “made possessors of our lot”. But all becomes plainer if we understand the idea to be rather that of God’s possession in us, the <span class="greekheb">περιποίησις</span> being taken as the equivalent of the OT <span class="greekheb">סְגֻלָּה מִבָּל־הָצַמִּיס, סגֻלָה</span>, by which Israel is designated as the possession acquired by the Lord for Himself (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-18.htm" title="And the LORD has avouched you this day to be his peculiar people, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a>). It is true that the LXX rendering of <span class="greekheb">סְגֻלָּה</span> is usually <span class="greekheb">περιούσιος</span>. But that is not the only form that is adopted. In <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a> the phrase is <span class="greekheb">εἰς περιουσιασμὸν ἑαυτῷ</span>; and in <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>, where Aquila has <span class="greekheb">περιούσιος</span>, the LXX has <span class="greekheb">εἰς περιποίησιν</span>. Further, in <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a> the same idea is expressed by the corresponding verb—<span class="greekheb">λαόν μου ὃν περιεποιησάμην</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἣν περιεποιήσατο</span>). So, too, Peter, with this passage in view, describes the spiritual Israel of the NT as <span class="greekheb">λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν</span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>); while in <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>, again, we have <span class="greekheb">λαὸν περιούσιον</span>. This interpretation is that of the Syriac, Erasm., Calvin, etc., and it is preferred by most recent commentators, including Harless, Meyer, Ell., Alf., etc. It is adopted also by the RV, which renders it “<span class="ital">God’s</span> own possession”. Wycliffe, however, gives “purchasynge”; the Genevan, “that we might be <span class="ital">fully</span> restored to liberty”; the Rhemish, “the redemption of acquisition”; the AV, Tyndall and Cranmer give “the purchased possession”.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">unto the praise of his glory</span>. The second end of the <span class="ital">sealing</span>, or rather the second aspect of the ultimate purpose of God in the sealing. The final end on our side of that great act of grace is the consummation of the redemption of those who have been made God’s own people. On God’s side the final end of the same grace is “the praise of His glory”—the adoring confession of the glories of the Divine Nature and Mind so revealed to men. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> refers to the main subject here, not Christ <span class="ital">in</span> whom we obtain the grace, but God <span class="ital">by</span> whom it is willed—the Eternal Origin of all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

It appears in the LXX. (only in <a href="/context/genesis/38-17.htm" title="And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?...">Genesis 38:17-18</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-20.htm" title="And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.">Genesis 38:20</a>); in the later Greek classics (e.g. Aristotle); and in the Latin classics. It is Shemitic (Heb. <span class="ital">’êrâbhôn</span>, Genesis 38) by derivation. See further, Additional Note, p. 164. It probably reached the Greeks and Latins through the (Shemitic) Phenician traders. By derivation it has to do with <span class="ital">exchange</span>, and so first means a <span class="ital">pledge</span> (the word used here by the ancient Latin versions) to be exchanged between two parties to an agreement—first given, then on fulfilment returned. But usage brought it to the kindred meaning of an <span class="ital">earnest;</span> a part of a price, given as a tangible promise of the payment of the whole in time. Thus it is defined by the Greek lexicographers. It was used for the bridegroom’s betrothal-gifts to the bride; a case exactly in point here. In ecclesiastical Latin, prose and verse, it appears usually in the shortened form <span class="ital">arra</span>. It survives in the French <span class="ital">arrhes</span>, the money paid to strike a bargain.—<span class="ital">Arrhâbôn</span> occurs elsewhere in N. T. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>. There, as here, it denotes the gifts of the Holy Spirit given to the saints, as the part-payment of their coming “weight of glory,” the inmost essence of which is the complete attainment (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>) of that likeness to their Lord which the Spirit begins and developes here (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). A kindred expression is “<span class="ital">the firstfruits</span> of the Spirit,” <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>, where see note in this Series.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our inheritance</span>] The “enjoyment fully for ever” of God in Christ; the final Canaan of the true Israel, His “heirs” because His children (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until</span>] Better, perhaps (as the more usual meaning of the Gr.), <span class="bld">unto</span>; with a view to; as the spiritual means to the glorious end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">redemption</span>] See note on <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, and on <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>. The saints already “have redemption,” in the radical sense of Acceptance, rescue from condemnation into sonship. But they still look forward to redemption, in the developed sense of actual emancipation from the last effects of sin, which is to come when the body is glorified along with the spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the purchased possession</span>] The R. V. renders “<span class="ital">God’s own</span> possession.” “Purchased” is an idea not necessary to the Gr. noun (though such passages as <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a> readily suggest it as a kindred idea here), which denotes simply “acquisition,” however made.—The explanatory word “God” is doubtless a true interpretation.—The noun is the same as that in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where “peculiar” means (literally from the Gr.) “intended for (His) <span class="ital">personal property</span>”. Thus the thought here is not of “glory” as the “property” of the saints, but of the saints, the Church, the New Israel (cp. <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a>), as the property of God, to be hereafter actually “bought back” from the grave for His eternal use and pleasure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the praise of His glory</span>] Cp. note on <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>.

The seal of the Spirit not only assures us of the full inheritance to come, but gives us a right conception of its nature. It shows us the kind of provision God makes for those whom he takes as his heritage, his peculiar people. It is an inward heaven the Spirit brings them. "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." The full inheritance will consist in a heart in full sympathy with God, and in those occupations and joys, intellectual and moral, which are most congenial to such a heart. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the redemption of the purchased possession.</span> The <span class="accented">until</span> of the A.V. is not textual, and does not give the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, which implies that the earnest of the Spirit is a contribution toward the result described; it tends to realize it. "Redemption" here is not quite equivalent to "redemption" in ver. 7; for there it is a thing accomplished, here it is a thing to come. It is obvious that here the meaning is the completed redemption - the full and final deliverance of the Lord's heritage from all sin and sorrow, from all the evils and disorders of this life. The term <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, translated" purchased possession," is an unusual one.

In this place the precise meaning is that the consummation of redemption will be the highest tribute to God's glory - his infinite excellence will be wonderfully manifested thereby. Neither men nor angels are qualified to apprehend the glorious excellence of God in an abstract way; it needs to be revealed, exhibited in acts and operations. The teaching of this verse is that it will be manifested with triumphant brightness in the final redemption of the Church, when the groans of nature shall come to an end, and the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into "the glorious liberty of the sons of God" (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Earnest<p>See on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>.<p>Unto the redemption, etc.<p>Construe with ye were sealed.<p>Of the purchased possession (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>See on peculiar, <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>.
