The words should be connected with the previous verse, and translated thus: <span class= "ital">which</span> <span class= "ital">He purposed in Himself for administration</span> (or <span class= "ital">disposal</span>)<span class= "ital"> of the fulness of the </span>(<span class= "ital">appointed</span>)<span class= "ital"> seasons, to</span> <span class= "ital">gather, </span>&c. We note (1) that the word “dispensation” is usually applied to the action of the servants of God, as “dispensers of His mysteries.” (See <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1Corinthians 9:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>.) Here, however, and in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, it is applied to the disposal of all by God Himself, according to “the law which He has set Himself to do all things by.” Next (2) that the word “fulness,” or <span class= "ital">completeness, </span>frequently used by St. Paul, is only found in connection with time in this passage, and in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a> (“when the fulness of time was come”). There, however, the reference is to a point of time, marking the completion of the preparation for our Lord’s coming; here, apparently, to a series of “seasons,” “which the Father hath put in His own power” (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>) for the completion of the acts of the Mediatorial kingdom described in the words following. (Comp <a href="/matthew/16-3.htm" title="And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not discern the signs of the times?">Matthew 16:3</a>; <a href="/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1Thessalonians 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm" title="Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;">1Timothy 6:15</a>; <a href="/titus/1-3.htm" title="But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;">Titus 1:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That he might gather together in one all things in Christ.</span>—In these words St. Paul strikes the great keynote of the whole Epistle, the UNITY OF ALL IN CHRIST. The expression “to gather together in one” is the same which is used in <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a> (where all commandments are said to be “briefly comprehended,” or <span class= "ital">summed up, </span>“in the one saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”). Here, however, there is the additional idea that this gathering up is “for Himself.” The full meaning of this expression is “to gather again under one head” things which had been originally one, but had since been separated. The best comment upon the truth here briefly summed up is found in the full exposition of the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16-20</a>), “In Him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth . . . all things were created by Him and for Him . . . and in Him all things consist. It pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell, and . . . by Him to reconcile all things to Himself . . . whether things on earth or things in heaven.” In Christ, as the Word of God in the beginning, all created things are considered as gathered up, through Him actually made, and in Him continuing to exist. This unity, broken by sin, under the effect of which “all creation groans” (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>), is restored in the Incarnation and Atonement of the Son of God. By this, therefore, all things are again summed up in Him, and again made one in Him with the Father. In both passages St. Paul uses expressions which extend beyond humanity itself—“things in heaven and things in earth,” “things visible and things invisible,” “thrones and principalities and powers.” In both he immediately proceeds from the grand outline of this wider unity, to draw out in detail the nearer, and to us more comprehensible, unity of all mankind in Christ. (Comp. <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>.) So also writes St. John (<a href="/context/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3-4</a>; <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>), passing from the thought that “all things were made by Him,” first to the declaration, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,” and next to the power given to those who believed on Him to become sons of God. The lesser part of this truth, setting forth the unity of all mankind in the Second Adam, forms the basis of the argument of 1 Corinthians 15, that “in Christ all shall be made alive,” in the course of which the existence of the Mediatorial kingdom of Christ is described, and its continuance till the final triumph, when it “shall be delivered up to God, even the Father,” “that God may be all in all” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>). In virtue of it, those who are His are partakers of His death and resurrection, His ascension, even His judgment (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-10</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1Corinthians 6:2-3</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1-3</a>).<p>(10, 11) <span class= "bld">Even in him: in whom also we have obtained an inheritance.</span>—We have here (in the repetition, “even in Him”) an emphatic transition to the truth most closely concerning the Apostle and his readers. The word “we” is not here emphatic, and the statement might be a general statement applicable to all Christians; but the succeeding verse seems to limit it to the original Jewish believers—the true Israel, who (like the whole of Israel in ancient days) have become “a people of inheritance” (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm" title="But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-29.htm" title="Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm" title="For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>), so succeeding to the privileges (<a href="/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>) which their brethren in blindness rejected. Possibly this suggests the peculiar word here (and here only) used, meaning either “we were made partakers of a lot” in God’s kingdom (to which <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>, “who has made us meet for a part of the lot of the saints,” closely corresponds), or “we were made His lot or inheritance;” which perhaps suits the Greek better, certainly accords better with the Old Testament idea, and gives a more emphatic sense. A third possible sense is “were chosen by lot.” This is adopted by the Vulgate, supported by the only use of the word in the Septuagint (<a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm" title="Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.">1Samuel 14:41</a>), and explained by Chrysostom and Augustine as signifying the freedom of election without human merit, while by the succeeding words it is shown not to be really by chance, but by God’s secret will. But this seems quite foreign to the genius of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">Being predestinated . . . that we should be to the praise of his glory.</span>—This is an application of the general truth before declared (<a href="/context/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5-6</a>) that the source of election is God’s predestination, and the object of it the manifestation of His glory.<p><span class= "bld">After the counsel of his own will.</span>—The expression evidently denotes not only the deliberate exercise of God’s will by “determinate counsel and foreknowledge” (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>), but also the guidance of that will by wisdom to the fulfilment of the Law Eternal of God’s righteous dispensation. Hooker, in a well-known passage (<span class= "ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> i. 2), quotes it as excluding the notion of an arbitrary will of God, “They err, who think that of God’s will there is no reason except His will.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That in the dispensation - The word rendered here as "dispensation," &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  oikonomia, means properly "the management of household affairs." Then it means stewardship or administration; a dispensation or arrangement of things: a scheme or plan. The meaning here is, that this plan was formed in order (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis) or "unto" this end, that in the full arrangement of times, or in the arrangements completing the filling up of the times, God might gather together in one all things. Tyndale renders it: "to have it declared when the time was full come," etc.<p>The fulness of times - When the times were fully completed; when all the periods should have passed by which he had prescribed, or judged necessary to the completion of the object. The period referred to here is that when all things shall be gathered together in the Redeemer at the winding up of human affairs, or the consummation of all things. The arrangement was made with reference to that, and embraced all things which conduced to that. The plan stretched from before "the foundation of the world" to the period when all times should be completed; and of course all the events occurring in that intermediate period were embraced in the plan.<p>He might gather together in one - The word used here -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  anakephalaioo&#772; - means literally, to sum up, to recapitulate, as an orator does at the close of his discourse. It is from &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;  kephale&#772;, the head; or &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  kephalaion, the sum, the chief thing, the main point. In the New Testament, the word means to collect under one head, or to comprehend several things under one; <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>. "It is briefly comprehended," i. e., summed up under this one precept," sc., "love." In the passage before us, it means that God would sum up, or comprehend all things in heaven and earth through the Christian dispensation; he would make one empire, under one head, with common feelings, and under the same laws. The reference is to the unity which will hereafter exist in the kingdom of God, when all his friends on earth and in heaven shall be united, and all shall have a common head. Now there is alienation. The earth has been separated from other worlds by rebellion. It has gone off into apostasy and sin. It refuses to acknowledge the Great Head to which other worlds are subject, and the object is to restore it to its proper place, so that there shall be one great and united kingdom.<p>All things - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;  ta panta. It is remarkable that Paul has used here a word which is in the neuter gender. It is not all "persons," all angels, or all human beings, or all the elect, but all "things." Bloomfield and others suppose that "persons" are meant, and that the phrase is used for &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  tous pantas. But it seems to me that Paul did not use this word without design. All "things" are placed under Christ, <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, and the design of God is to restore harmony in the universe. Sin has produced disorder not not only in "mind," but in "matter." The world is disarranged. The effects of transgression are seen everywhere; and the object of the plan of redemption is to put things on their pristine footing, and restore them as they were at first. Everything is, therefore, put under the Lord Jesus, and all things are to be brought under his control, so as to constitute one vast harmonious empire. The amount of the declaration here is, that there is hereafter to be one kingdom, in which there shall be no jar or alienation; that the now separated kingdoms of heaven and earth shall be united under one head, and that henceforward all shall be harmony and love. The things which are to be united in Christ, are those which are "in heaven and which are on earth." Nothing is said of "hell." Of course this passage cannot teach the doctrine of universal salvation, since there is one world which is not to have a part in this ultimate union.<p>In Christ - By means of Christ, or under him, as the great head and king. He is to be the great agent in effecting this, and he is to preside over this united kingdom. In accordance with this view the heavenly inhabitants, the angels as well as the redeemed, are uniformly represented as uniting in the same worship, and as acknowledging the Redeemer as their common head and king; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-12</a>.<p>Both which are in heaven - Margin, as in Greek, "in the heavens." Many different opinions have been formed of the meaning of this expression. Some suppose it to mean the saints in heaven, who died before the coming of the Saviour; and some that it refers to the Jews, designated as "the heavenly people," in contradistinction from the Gentiles, as having nothing divine and heavenly in them, and as being of the "earth." The more simple and obvious interpretation is, however, without doubt, the correct one, and this is to suppose that it refers to the holy inhabitants of other worlds. The object of the plan of salvation is to produce a harmony between them and the redeemed on earth, or to produce out of all, one great and united kingdom. In doing this, it is not necessary to suppose that any change is to be produced in the inhabitants of heaven. All the change is to occur among those on earth, and the object is to make out of all, one harmonious and glorious empire.<p>And which are on earth - The redeemed on earth. The object is to bring them into harmony with the inhabitants of heaven. This is the great object proposed by the plan of salvation. It is to found one glorious and eternal kingdom, that shall comprehend all holy beings on earth and all in heaven. There is now discord and disunion. Man is separated from God, and from all holy beings. Between him and every holy being there is by nature discord and alienation. Unrenewed man has no sympathy with the feelings and work of the angels; no love for their employment; no desire to be associated with them. Nothing can be more unlike than the customs, feelings, laws, and habits which prevail on earth, from those which prevail in heaven. But the object of the plan of salvation is to restore harmony to those alienated communities, and produce eternal concord and love. Hence, learn:<p>(1) The greatness and glory of the plan of salvation. It is no trifling undertaking to "reconcile worlds," and of such discordant materials to found one great and glorious and eternal empire.<p>(2) the reason of the interest which angels feel in the plan of redemption; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. They are deeply concerned in the redemption of those who, with them, are to constitute that great kingdom which is to be eternal. Without envy at the happiness of others; without any feeling that the accession of others will diminish "their" felicity or glory, they wait to hail the coming of others, and rejoice to receive even one who comes to be united to their number.<p>(3) this plan was worthy of the efforts of the Son of God. To restore harmony in heaven and earth; to prevent the evils of alienation and discord; to rear one immense and glorious kingdom, was an object worthy the incarnation of the Son of God.<p>(4) the glory of the Redeemer. He is to be exalted as the Head of this united and ever-glorious kingdom, and all the redeemed on earth and the angelic hosts shall acknowledge him as their common Sovereign and Head.<p>(5) this is the greatest and most important enterprise on earth. It should engage every heart, and enlist the powers of every soul. It should be the earnest desire of all to swell the numbers of those who shall constitute this united and ever-glorious kingdom, and to bring as many as possible of the human race into union with the holy inhabitants of he other world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Translate, "Unto the dispensation of the fulness of the times," that is, "which He purposed in Himself" (Eph 1:9) with a view to the economy of (the gracious administration belonging to) the fulness of the times (Greek, "fit times," "seasons"). More comprehensive than "the fulness of the time" (Ga 4:4). The whole of the Gospel times (plural) is meant, with the benefits to the Church dispensed in them severally and successively. Compare "the ages to come" (Eph 2:7). "The ends of the ages" (Greek, 1Co 10:11); "the times (same Greek as here, 'the seasons,' or 'fitly appointed times') of the Gentiles" (Lu 21:24); "the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power" (Ac 1:7); "the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the prophets since the world began" (Ac 3:20, 21). The coming of Jesus at the first advent, "in the fulness of time," was one of these "times." The descent of the Holy Ghost, "when Pentecost was fully come" (Ac 2:1), was another. The testimony given by the apostles to Him "in due time" ("in its own seasons," Greek) (1Ti 2:6) was another. The conversion of the Jews "when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled," the second coming of Christ, the "restitution of all things," the millennial kingdom, the new heaven and earth, shall be severally instances of "the dispensation of the fulness of the times," that is, "the dispensation of" the Gospel events and benefits belonging to their respective "times," when severally filled up or completed. God the Father, according to His own good pleasure and purpose, is the Dispenser both of the Gospel benefits and of their several fitting times (Ac 1:7).<p>gather together in one&#8212;Greek, "sum up under one head"; "recapitulate." The "good pleasure which He purposed," was "to sum up all things (Greek, 'THE whole range of things') in Christ (Greek, 'the Christ,' that is, His Christ)" [Alford]. God's purpose is to sum up the whole creation in Christ, the Head of angels, with whom He is linked by His invisible nature, and of men with whom He is linked by His humanity; of Jews and Gentiles; of the living and the dead (Eph 3:15); of animate and inanimate creation. Sin has disarranged the creature's relation of subordination to God. God means to gather up all together in Christ; or as Col 1:20 says, "By Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, whether things in earth or things in heaven." Alford well says, "The Church of which the apostle here mainly treats, is subordinated to Him in the highest degree of conscious and joyful union; those who are not His spiritually, in mere subjugation, yet consciously; the inferior tribes of creation unconsciously; but objectively, all are summed up in Him."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some copies join the last clause of the former verse with this, leaving out the relative <span class="ital">which, </span> and concluding the sentence at <span class="ital">good pleasure, </span> and then read: <span class="ital">He purposed in himself, that in the dispensation, </span>& c.; but most read it as our translators have rendered it, only some understand an explicative particle, to wit, in the beginning of this verse, to wit, <span class="ital">that in the dispensation, </span> &c.; but either way the scope of the words is the same, viz. to give the sum of that <span class="ital">mystery of</span> God’s <span class="ital">will, </span> mentioned before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In the dispensation; </span> in that administration or distribution of the good things of God’s house; which he had determined should be in the fulness of time.

The meaning of the whole seems to be, that whereas the order and harmony of God’s principal workmanship, intellectual creatures, angels and men, had been disturbed and broken by the entering of sin into the world; all mankind, and many of the angels, having apostatized from him, and the remnant of them being in their own nature labile and mutable; God would, in his appointed time, give Christ (the Heir of all things) the honour of being the repairer of this breach, by gathering together again the disjointed members of his creation in and under Christ as their Head and Governor, confirming the good angels in their good estate, and recovering his elect among men from their apostate condition. Though it be true, that not only believers under the Old Testament were saved, but the elect angels confirmed before Christ’s coming, yet both the one and the other was with a respect to Christ as their Head, and the foundation of their union with God; and out of whom, as the one, being lost, could not have been restored, so the fall of the other could not have been prevented, nor their happiness secured. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ephesians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times,.... Or "according to the dispensation", &amp;c. as the Alexandrian copy reads; the fulness of time appointed by God, and fixed in the prophets; after many times and seasons were elapsed, from the creation of the world; at the most suitable and convenient time, when a new economy or dispensation began, within which all this was to be effected, hereafter mentioned: <p>he might gather together in one all things in Christ; this supposes, that all things were once united together in one; angels and men were united to God by the ties of creation, and were under the same law of nature, and there were peace and friendship between them; and this union was in Christ, as the beginning of the creation of God, in whom all things consist: and it supposes a disunion and scattering of them; as of men from God, and from good angels, which was done by sin; and of Jews and Gentiles from one another; and of one man from another, everyone turning to his own way; and then a gathering of them together again: the word here used signifies to restore, renew, and reduce to a former state; and so the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions render it; and according to this sense, it may seem to have respect to the times of the restitution of all things, the restoration and renovation of the universe; when there will be new heavens and a new earth, and new inhabitants in them: the word is also used to recapitulate, or sum up the heads of a discourse; and according to this sense, it may intend the meeting together, and summing up of all things in Christ, that had been before; as of all the promises and blessings of the covenant; of all the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament; of all the types and shadows, and sacrifices of the former dispensation; yea, all the sins of Old Testament saints, and all the curses of the law, met on him: the word is likewise used for the collection of numbers into one sum total; and Christ is the sum total of elect angels and men; or the whole number of them is in him; God has chosen a certain number of persons unto salvation; these he has put into the hands of Christ, who has a particular and personal knowledge of them; and the exact number of them will be gathered and given by him: once more, it signifies to reduce, or bring under one head; and Christ is an head of eminence and of influence, both to angels and men: and there is a collection of these together in one, in Christ; by virtue of redemption by Christ, and grace from him, there is an entire friendship between elect angels and elect men; they are social worshippers now, and shall share in the same happiness of the vision of God and of Christ hereafter: hence it follows, <p>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even <p>in him; by things in heaven are not meant the souls of saints in heaven; though it is true that the souls of departed saints are in heaven; and that the saints in heaven and on earth were gathered together in Christ, and represented by him, when he hung upon the cross; and that they all make up one body, of which Christ is the head; and that they will be all collected together one day; and that their souls which are in heaven, and their bodies which are in the earth, will come together and be reunited, and dwell with Christ for ever; but rather the angels are meant, whose origin is heaven; where they have their residence, and from whence they never fell; and whose employment is in heaven, and of an heavenly nature: and by things on earth, are not intended every creature on earth, animate and inanimate; nor all men, but all elect men, whether Jews or Gentiles, and some of all sorts, ranks, and degrees; whose origin is of the earth, and who are the inhabitants of it: all these angels in heaven, and elect men on earth, are brought together under one head, even in him, in Christ Jesus, and by him; and none but he was able to do it, and none so fit, who is the Creator of all, and is above all; and was typified by Jacob's ladder, which reached heaven and earth, and joined them together, and on which the angels of God ascended and descended. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; <i>even</i> in him:</span><p>(14) The Father exhibited and gave Christ, who is the head of all the elect to the world, at that time which was convenient according as he most wisely disposed all times from everlasting.

Before the entrance of sin all created beings and things were undividedly united under God’s government; all things in the world were normally combined into organic unity for God’s ends and in His service. But through sin this original union and harmony was broken, first of all in heaven, where a part of the angels sinned and fell away from God;[101] these formed, under Satan, the kingdom antagonistic to God, and upon earth brought about the fall of man (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>), extended their sway farther and farther, and were even worshipped in the heathen idols (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a> f.).

Comp. Photius in Oecumenius. Finally, the <span class="ital">middle voice</span> (<span class="ital">sibi</span> recolligere) has its warrant in the fact that God is the <span class="ital">Sovereign</span> (the head of Christ, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.">1 Corinthians 11:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>), who fulfils His will and aim by the gathering up again, etc.; so that, when the <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</span> is completed by the victory over all antichristian powers, He resumes even the dominion committed to the Son, and then God is the sole ruling principle (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>). Our passage is accordingly so framed as to receive its historically adequate elucidation from the N.T., and especially from Paul himself; and there is no reason for seeking to explain it from a later system of ideas, as Baur does (p. 424), who traces it to the underlying Gnostic idea, that all spiritual life which has issued from the supreme God must return to its original unity, and in that view the “affected” expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΟἸΚΟΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΛΗΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΙΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is held to convey a covert allusion to the Gnostic pleroma of aeons and its economy. See, on the other hand, Räbiger, <span class="ital">Christol. Paulina</span>, p. 55. The “genuinely <span class="ital">Catholic</span> consciousness” (Baur, <span class="ital">Christenth. d. drei erst. Jahrh</span>. p. 109) of the Epistle is just the genuinely <span class="ital">apostolic</span> one, necessarily rooted in Christ’s own word and work. The person of Christ is not presented “under the point of view of the metaphysical necessity of the process of the self-realizing idea” (Baur, <span class="ital">neutest. Theol</span>. p. 264), but under that of its actual history, as this was accomplished, in accordance with the counsel of the Father, by the free obedience of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[99] The apostolic idea of the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα τῶν καιρῶν</span> excludes the conception of a series of worlds without beginning or end (Rothe).

Goth.: “<span class="ital">aftra usfulljan</span>” (<span class="ital">again to fill up</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[101] For this falling away is the necessary presupposition for the Satanic seduction of our first parents, <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/ephesians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκονομίαν</span>: <span class="ital">unto a dispensation</span>. This expresses the <span class="ital">end</span> which God had in view in that which He purposed. Some (Erasm., Calv., etc.) give <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> the <span class="ital">temporal</span> sense of <span class="ital">usque ad.</span> But the idea is rather the more definite one of <span class="ital">design</span>. God had His reason for the long delay in the revelation of the “mystery”. That reason lay in the fact that the world was not ripe for the dispensation of grace which formed the contents of the mystery. In classical Greek the word <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομία</span> had the two meanings of (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">administration</span>, the management of a house or of property, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the <span class="ital">office</span> of administrator or steward. It was used of such things as the arrangement of the parts of a building (Vitruv., i., 2), the disposition of the parts of a speech (Quint., <span class="ital">Inst.</span>, iii., 3), and more particularly of the financial administration of a city (Arist., <span class="ital">Pol.</span>, <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Light., <span class="ital">Notes, sub voc.</span>). It has the same twofold sense in the NT—an <span class="ital">arrangement</span> or <span class="ital">administration</span> of things (in the passages in the present Epistle and in <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>), and the <span class="ital">office</span> of administrator—in particular the stewardship with which Paul was entrusted by God (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>). The idea at the basis of the statement here, therefore, as also in the somewhat analogous passage in <a href="/context/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;...">Galatians 4:1-11</a>, is that of a great household of which God is the Master and which has a certain system of management wisely ordered by Him. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the figure of the Church as the household of God (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house....">Hebrews 3:2-6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a>), and the parables which run in terms of God as <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδεσπότης</span> (<a href="/matthew/13-27.htm" title="So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did not you sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33</a>; <a href="/luke/13-25.htm" title="When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not from where you are:">Luke 13:25</a>; <a href="/luke/14-21.htm" title="So that servant came, and showed his lord these things.

(Harl.), but must be that of characteristic quality, “a dispensation <span class="ital">proper to</span> the fulness of the times” (Mey.), or it may express the <span class="ital">relation of time</span>, as in <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς</span> (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>), <span class="greekheb">κρίσις μεγάλης ἡμέρας</span> (<a href="/judges/1-6.htm" title="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Judges 1:6</a>). In <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a> the phrase takes the more general form <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου</span>; here it has the more specific form <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν καιρῶν</span>, the fulness of the <span class="ital">seasons</span>, or series of appointed, determinate times. The idea of the <span class="ital">fitness</span> of the times, it is probable, is also expressed by the <span class="greekheb">καιρῶν</span> as distinguished from <span class="greekheb">χρόνων</span>, the former being a qualitative term, the latter a quantitative (see Light., <span class="ital">Notes</span>, p. 70). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>, and especially the <span class="greekheb">πεπλήρωται ὁ καιρός</span> of <a href="/mark/1-15.htm" title="And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.">Mark 1:15</a>. In classical Greek <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> appears to have both the passive sense, “that which is filled,” and the active, “that which fills”. The former is rare, the latter is sufficiently common. See Lidd. and Scott, <span class="ital">Lex.</span>, and Rost u. Palm., <span class="ital">Worth., sub voce</span>. In the NT likewise it seems to have both senses (though this is questioned); the passive being found in the great doctrinal passages in the Pauline Epistles (<a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>, etc.), the active occurring more frequently and in a variety of applications (<a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>; <a href="/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a>; <a href="/mark/6-43.htm" title="And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.">Mark 6:43</a>; <a href="/mark/8-20.htm" title="And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? And they said, Seven.">Mark 8:20</a>; <a href="/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-26.htm" title="For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.">1 Corinthians 10:26</a>). With reference to <span class="ital">time</span> it means “complement”—the particular time that completes a long prior period or a previous series of seasons. The purport of the statement, therefore, appears to be this: God has His household, the kingdom of heaven, with its special disposition of affairs, its <span class="greekheb">οἰκονόμος</span> or steward (who is Christ), its own proper method of administration, and its gifts and privileges intended for its members. But these gifts and privileges could not be dispensed in their fulness while those for whom they were meant were under age (<a href="/context/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;...">Galatians 4:1-3</a>) and unprepared for them. A period of waiting had to elapse, and when the process of training was finished and the time of maturity was reached the gifts could be bestowed in their completeness. God, the Master of the House, had this fit time in view as the hidden purpose of His grace. When that time came He disclosed His secret in the incarnation of Christ and introduced the new disposition of things which explained His former dealings with men and the long delay in the revelation of the complete purpose of His grace. So the Fathers came to speak of the incarnation as the <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομία</span> (Just., <span class="ital">Dial.</span>, 45, 120; Iren., i., 10; Orig., <span class="ital">C. Cels.</span>, ii., 9, etc.). This “œconomy of the fulness of the seasons,” therefore, is that stewardship of the Divine grace which was to be the trust of Christ, in other words, the dispensation of the Gospel, and that dispensation as fulfilling itself in the whole period from the first advent of Christ to the second. In this last respect the present passage differs from that in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>. In the latter “the fulness of the time” appears to refer definitely to the mission of Christ into the world and His work there. Here the context (especially the idea expressed by the next clause) extends the reference to the final completion of the work—and the close of the dispensation at the Second Coming.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι</span>: <span class="ital">to sum up</span>. Or, having regard to the Middle Voice, “to sum up for Himself”. The sentence thus introduced is one of the select class of passages which refer to the cosmical relations of Christ’s Person or Work. It is one of great doctrinal importance. Its exact import, however, is very differently understood by different interpreters. Every word in it requires attention. There is <span class="ital">first</span> the question of its precise relation to the paragraph of which it forms part. The inf. is taken by most (Mey., Ell., etc.) to be the <span class="ital">epexegetic</span> inf., conveying something complementary to, or explanatory of, the preceding statement, and so = “namely (or to wit), to sum up”. It is that inf., however, in the particular aspect of <span class="ital">consequence</span> or <span class="ital">contemplated result</span> = “so as to sum up” (so Light.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., pp. 399, 400). But with what part of the paragraph is this complementary sentence immediately connected? The doctrinal significance of the sentence depends to a considerable extent on the answer to the question, and the answer takes different forms. Some understand the thing which is explained or complemented to be the whole idea contained in the statement from <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span> onwards, “at once the content of the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>, the object of the <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκία</span>, and the object reserved for the <span class="greekheb">οἰκ</span>.” (Abb.). Others limit it to the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> (Bez., Harl., Kl[55]), or to the <span class="greekheb">προέθετο</span> (Flatt, Hofm.). Others understand it to refer to the <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκίαν</span> in particular, the <span class="greekheb">ἣν</span> … <span class="greekheb">καιρῶν</span> clause being regarded as a parenthesis (Alf., Haupt); and others regard it as unfolding the meaning of the immediately preceding clause—the <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομίαν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. (Mey., etc.). The last seems to be the simplest view, the others involving more or less remoteness of the explanatory sentence from the sentence to be explained. So the point would be that the <span class="ital">œconomy</span>, the new order of things which God in the purpose of His grace had in view for the fulness of the seasons, was one which had for its end or object a certain <span class="ital">summing up</span> of all things. But in what sense is this <span class="ital">summing up</span> to be understood? The precise meaning of this rare word <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι</span> has to be looked at. In the classics it is used of <span class="ital">repeating summarily</span> the points of a speech, gathering its argument together in a summary form. So Quintilian explains the noun <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</span> as <span class="ital">rerum repetitio et congregatio</span> (vi., 1), and Aristotle speaks of the <span class="greekheb">ἔργον ῥητορικῆς</span> as being <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι πρὸς ἀνάμνησιν</span> (<span class="ital">Frag.</span>, 123). In late Greek the verb means also to present in <span class="ital">compendious form</span> or to <span class="ital">reproduce</span> (<span class="ital">Protev. fac.</span>, 13). The simple verb <span class="greekheb">κεφαλαιοῦν</span> in the classics denotes in like manner to <span class="ital">state summarily</span>, or <span class="ital">bring under heads</span> (Thuc. iii., 67, vi., 91, etc.), and the noun <span class="greekheb">κεφάλαιον</span> is used in the sense of the <span class="ital">chief point</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Laws</span>, 643 D), the <span class="ital">sum of the matter</span> (Pind., <span class="ital">P.</span>, 4, 206), a <span class="ital">head</span> or <span class="ital">topic</span> in argument (Dionys. Hal., <span class="ital">De Rhet.</span>, x., 5), a <span class="ital">recapitulation</span> of an argument (Plato, <span class="ital">Tim.</span>, 26, etc.). In the NT the verb <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι</span> occurs only twice, namely here and in <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>; in which latter passage it is used of the <span class="ital">summing up</span> of the various commandments in the one requirement of love to one’s neighbour. The simple verb <span class="greekheb">κεφαλαιοῦν</span> occurs only once, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, in <a href="/mark/12-4.htm" title="And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.">Mark 12:4</a>, where it has the sense of <span class="ital">wounding in the head</span>; but the text is uncertain there, TTrWH reading <span class="greekheb">ἐκεφαλίωσαν</span> with [56] [57] [58], etc. The noun <span class="greekheb">κεφάλαιον</span> is found twice, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, in <a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>, where it has the sense of a <span class="ital">sum of money</span> (as in <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm" title="Or all that about which he has sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it to him to whom it appertains, in the day of his trespass offering.">Leviticus 6:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm" title="Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.">Numbers 5:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-26.htm" title="Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:">Numbers 31:26</a>), and in <a href="/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>, where it means the <span class="ital">chief point</span> in the things that the writer has been saying. The prevailing idea conveyed by these terms, therefore, appears to be that of a logical, rhetorical, or arithmetical summing up. The subsequent specification of the objects of the <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι</span>, however, makes it plain that what is in view here is not a logical or rhetorical, but a real or objective summing up. Further, as the verb comes not from <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span> but from <span class="greekheb">κεφάλαιον</span>, it does not refer to the summing up of things under a <span class="ital">head</span>, and the point of view, therefore, is not that of the <span class="ital">Headship</span> of Christ—which comes to distinct expression at the close of the chapter. On the other hand it does not seem necessary to limit the sense of the word (with Haupt) to the idea of a <span class="ital">résumé</span> or <span class="ital">compendious presentation</span> of things in a single person. The question remains as to the force of the prep. in the compound verb. The <span class="greekheb">ἀνα</span> is taken by many to add the idea of <span class="ital">again</span>, and to make the result or end in view the bringing things back to a unity which had once existed but had been lost. So it is understood by the Pesh., the Vulg., Tertull. (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in his <span class="ital">Adv. Marc.</span>, v., 17, “affirmat omnia ad initium recolligi in Christo”; in the <span class="ital">De Monog.</span>, 5, “adeo in Christo omnia revocantur ad initium,” etc.), Mey., Alf., Abb., etc. On the other hand, Chrys. makes the compound verb equivalent to <span class="greekheb">συνάψαι</span>; and the idea of a return to a former condition is negatived by many, the <span class="greekheb">ἀνα</span> being taken to have simply the sense which it has in <span class="greekheb">ἀναγινώσκειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνακρίνειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνακυκᾶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀναλογίζεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀναμάνθανειν</span>, etc., and to express the idea of “<span class="ital">going over</span> the separate elements for the purpose of uniting them” (Light., <span class="ital">Notes</span>, p. 322). Usage on the whole is on the side of the latter view, and accordingly the conclusion is drawn by some that this “summing up” is not the recovery of a broken pristine unity, but the gathering together of objects now apart and unrelated into a final, perfect unity. Nevertheless it may be said that the verb, if it does not itself definitely express the idea of the restoration of a lost unity, gets that idea from the context. For the whole statement, of which the <span class="greekheb">ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι</span> clause forms part, runs in terms of a <span class="ital">redemption</span>, and the cognate passage in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> speaks of a final <span class="ital">reconciliation</span> of all things.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>: <span class="ital">all things</span>. An all-inclusive phrase, equivalent to the totality of creation; not <span class="ital">things</span> only, nor yet <span class="ital">men</span> or intelligent beings only (although the phrase might bear that sense, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a>), but, as the context shows, all created objects, men and things. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the universal expression in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ</span>: <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, or rather “in the Christ,” the introduction of the article indicating that the term has its official sense here. The same is clearly the case in <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>, and, as Alford notices, the article does not seem to be attached to the term <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> after a prep. unless some special point is in view. The point of union in this gathering together of all things is the Christ of God. In Him they are to be unified.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>: <span class="ital">the things in the heavens. and the things upon the earth</span>. Or, according to the better reading and as in RV marg., <span class="ital">the things upon the heavens, and the things upon the earth</span>. The reading of the TR, though supported by [59] [60] [61], most cursives, Chrys., etc., must give place to <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>, which is adopted by LTTrWH on the basis of [62] [63] [64] [65], etc. It is an unusual form for the compound phrase, the term <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span> being ordinarily coupled with <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ephesians/3-15.htm" title="Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,">Ephesians 3:15</a>; also the parallel in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> is poorly attested). The <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>, however, may have the force of <span class="ital">at</span>, which it has in such phrases as <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πύλῃσιν</span> (<span class="ital">Il.</span>, iii., 149), <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πύργῳ</span> (<span class="ital">Il.</span>, vi., 431), <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ προβατικῇ</span> (<a href="/context/acts/3-10.htm" title="And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him....">Acts 3:10-11</a>), the heavens being regarded, as Meyer thinks, as “the stations at which the things concerned are to be found”. The phrase in its two contrasted parts defines the preceding <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, making the all-inclusive nature of its universality clear by naming its great divisions. It is not to be understood as referring in its first section to any particular class, <span class="ital">spirits in heaven, departed saints of Old Testament times, angels</span> (as even Chrys. and Calv. thought), <span class="ital">Jews</span>, and in its second section specifically to <span class="ital">men</span> or to <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>. It explains the universality expressed by <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> as the widest possible and most comprehensive universality, including the sum total of created objects, wherever found, whether men or things.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>: <span class="ital">in him</span>. Emphatic resumption of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ</span> and transition to the following statement, solemnly re-affirming also, as Ell. suggests, <span class="ital">where</span> the true point of unity designed by God, or the sphere of its manifestation, is to be found.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] Klöpper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

But interpreted as above it has nothing to do with any such doctrine, whether in the sense of a final salvation of all unrighteous and unbelieving men or in that of a final recovery of all evil beings, devils and men alike. Nor, again, does it refer particularly to the case of the <span class="ital">individual</span>. It speaks, as Meyer notices, of the “aggregate of heavenly and earthly things,” and of that as destined to make a true unity at last. Another view of the general import of the statement, which has been elaborated with much ability by Haupt, requires some notice. Pressing to its utmost the sense of a <span class="ital">résumé</span> or <span class="ital">summary</span>, which he regards as the idea essentially contained in the terms in question, he contends that the meaning of the statement is that in Christ, who belongs at once to humanity and to the heavenly world, should be seen the compendious presentation of all beings and things—that in His person should be summarised the totality of created objects, both earthly and heavenly, so that outside Him nothing should exist. He looks for the proper parallel to this not in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, but in <a href="/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:...">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where it is said of Christ that “in Him were all things created” and that “in Him all things consist”. And he appeals in support of his view to the use of the kindred verb <span class="greekheb">συγκεφαλαιοῦσθαι</span> in Xen. (<span class="ital">Cyr.</span>, viii., 1, 15, viii., 6, 14), where it expresses the organisation of a multitude of slaves under one representative, in whom they and their acts were so embodied that Cyrus could transact with all when dealing with the one. But the idea of Christ’s agency in the first creation and the continuous maintenance of things is not expressed in the passage in Ephesians, and while it is the pre-existent Christ that is in view in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, here it is the risen Christ. It remains, therefore, that the present passage belongs to the same class as <a href="/context/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,...">Romans 8:20-22</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, etc., and expresses the truth that Christ is to be the point of union and reconciliation for all things, so that the whole creation shall be finally restored by Him to its normal condition of harmony and unity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">in the dispensation</span>, &c.] Lit., <span class="bld">in view of the stewardship of the fulness of the seasons</span>. The word rendered “dispensation” is lit. “stewardship, house-management.” Its special meaning here seems to be that the eternal Son is the True Steward in the great House of the Father’s spiritual Church; and that into His hands is to be put the actual government of it as it stands complete in the “fulness, or, fulfilment, of the seasons” (cp. for the phrase <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>); i.e. in the great Age of the Gospel, in which the universality of the Church, long indicated and prepared for by successive “seasons,” or stages, of providence and revelation, is at length a patent fact. In other words, the Father “purposed” that His Son should be, in a supreme sense, the manifested Governor and Dispenser of the developed period of grace, of which “glory” is but the outburst and flower.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gather together in one all</span> things <span class="ital">in Christ</span>] This clause explains the clause previous; the “stewardship” was to be, in fact, the actual and manifested Headship of Christ. The Gr. may be literally represented by “that He might <span class="ital">head up</span> all things in Christ.” The verb is only used elsewhere (in N. T.) <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>, where A. V. reads “it is briefly comprehended,” summed up. The element “head” in the compound verb <span class="ital">need</span> not appear in translation; as it does not in either A. V. or R. V. (which reads “sum up”). But the Lord is so markedly seen in this Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>; and see <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>) as the Head of the Church that a special reference to the thought and word seems to us almost certain here. We render, accordingly, <span class="bld">to sum up all things in Christ as Head</span>.—“<span class="ital">In Christ</span>” will here import a vital and organic connexion; as so often.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">both which are in heaven</span>, &c.] Here, and in the close parallel, <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, the context favours the reference of “all <span class="ital">things</span>” to the subjects of spiritual redemption who are in view through the whole passage; not explicitly to the <span class="ital">Universe</span>, in the largest sense of that word. More precisely, regenerate men are specially intended by “the things on earth,” as distinguished from “the things in heaven,” the angelic race, which also is “made subject” to the glorified Christ (<a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>, and see <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>). The meaning here will thus be that under the supreme Headship of the Son were to be gathered, with the “elect angels” (<a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a>), all “the children of God scattered abroad” (<a href="/john/11-52.htm" title="And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.">John 11:52</a>); the true members of the universal Church. So, nearly, St Chrysostom interprets the passage; making the meaning to be that “both to angels and to men the Father has appointed one Head, according to the flesh, that is Christ.” (He has previously explained the verb (see last note) to mean “sum up,” “gather together;” but here recognizes an additional reference to the <span class="ital">Headship</span> of Christ.)—See further Appendix A.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A. HEADSHIP OF CHRIST WITH RELATION TO THE UNIVERSE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Commentary, on ch. <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>, we have advocated the restriction of the reference of the Headship to the Lord’s connexion with the Church. This is by no means to ignore His connexion with the whole created Universe; a truth expressly taught in the Holy Scriptures (see esp. <a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>, and <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, though the latter passage makes its main reference to personal existences, not to merely material things). The connexion of the Eternal and Incarnate Son with the created World is indicated to us, directly and indirectly, as a profound and manifold connexion. But on a careful view of the whole teaching of the Ephesian Epistle we think it will be seen that the Epistle does not, so to speak, <span class="ital">look this way</span> with its revelations and doctrines, but is occupied supremely with the Lord’s relations with His Church, and with other intelligent existences through it. And we doubt whether the imagery of the <span class="ital">Head</span> is anywhere (if not here) to be found used with reference to the Universe at large, material and immaterial alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>) Construe with <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span>, <span class="ital">having made known</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οἰκονομίαν τοῦ πληρώματος τῶν καιρῶν</span>, <span class="ital">the dispensation of the fulness of the times</span>) <span class="ital">Fulness</span> <span class="greekheb">τῶν καιρῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of the times</span>,[10] is in some degree distinguished from the fulness <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΧΡΌΝΟΥ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">of the time</span>, <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>, for it involves the fulness of the benefits themselves, and of men reaping these benefits, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm" title="And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.">Mark 1:15</a>.

This seems to denote the times of the gospel generally; not, as in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, the particular time of Christ's advent; the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or economy, of the gospel being that during which, in its successive periods, all God's schemes are to ripen or come to maturity, and be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">To gather together under one head all things in Christ.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a word of some difficulty.

The word expresses the Divine purpose - what God <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;</span> was to restore in Christ a lost unity, to bring together disunited elements, viz. <span class="cmt_word">all things, whether they be things in heaven or things on earth.</span> There is no hint here of a universal restoration. Such a notion would be in fiat contradiction to the doctrine of Divine election, which dominates the whole passage. God's purpose is to form a united kingdom, consisting of the unfallen and the restored - the unfallen in heaven, and the restored on earth, and to gather this whole body together under Christ as its Head (see <a href="/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>). We cannot say that this purpose has been fully effected as yet; but things are moving towards it, and one day it will be wholly realized. "He that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new" (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That in the dispensation, etc. (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The A.V. is faulty and clumsy. &#x395;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c2; does not mean in, but unto, with a view to.

For times, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, "fullness of the time (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), where the time before Christ is conceived as a unit. Here the conception is of a series of epochs. The fullness of the times is the moment when the successive ages of the gospel dispensation are completed. The meaning of the whole phrase, then, is: a dispensation characterized: by the fullness of the times: set forth when the times are full.<p>To sum up all things in Christ (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Explanatory of the preceding phrase; showing in what the dispensation consists. For the word, see on <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>. It means to bring back to and gather round the main point (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), not the head (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;); so that, in itself, it does not indicate Christ (the Read) as the central point of regathering, though He is so in fact. That is expressed by the following in Christ. The compounded preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769; signifies again, pointing back to a previous condition where no separation existed. All things. All created beings and things; not limited to intelligent beings. Compare <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>.<p>The connection of the whole is as follows: God made known the mystery of His will, the plan of redemption, according to His own good pleasure, in order to bring to pass an economy peculiar to that point of time when the ages of the christian dispensation should be fulfilled - an economy which should be characterized by the regathering of all things round one point, Christ.<p>God contemplates a regathering, a restoration to that former condition when all things were in perfect unity, and normally combined to serve God's ends. This unity was broken by the introduction of sin. Man's fall involved the unintelligent creation (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>). The mystery of God's will includes the restoration of this unity in and through Christ; one kingdom on earth and in heaven - a new heaven and a new earth in which shall dwell righteousness, and "the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God." </body></html>
