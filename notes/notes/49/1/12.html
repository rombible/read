But the meaning of the phrase “who first hoped” (or, more properly, <span class= "ital">who have hoped beforehand</span>) is less obvious. Our version seems to interpret it simply of “believing before” the Gentiles, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of being the “first believers;” and this interpretation may be defended by the analogy of certain cases in which the same prefix signifying “beforehand” has this sense (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>; <a href="/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>; <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

But the more general analogy strongly supports the other interpretation, “who have hoped in the Christ before He came”—that is, who, taught by prophecy, entering into that vision of a great future which pervades the older Covenant, looked forward “to the hope of Israel,” and “waited for the consolation of Israel;” and who accordingly in due time became, on the Day of Pentecost, the firstfruits of His salvation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That we should be to the praise of his glory - Should be the occasion or the means of celebrating his glory; or that praise should be ascribed to him as the result of our salvation.<p>Who first trusted in Christ - Margin, "hoped." This is in accordance with the original. The foundation of their "hope" was the Saviour. Some suppose that the apostle here refers to the Jews who were converted before the gospel was preached extensively to the Gentiles. The reason for this opinion is, that in the following verse he contrasts those to whom he here refers with others whom he was addressing. But it may be that by the word "we" in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11-12</a>, he refers to himself and to his fellow-laborers who had "first" hoped in the Saviour, and had then gone and proclaimed the message to others; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>. They "first" believed, and then preached to others; and they also believed, and became partakers of the same privileges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

So, correctly, Zöckler takes it, <span class="ital">de vi ac notione vocab.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span>, 1856, p. 32 f. But de Wette, who (comp.

But in this way the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟ</span></span></span> would be <span class="ital">without significance</span>, while, as taken by us, it is <span class="ital">characteristic</span>. It is incorrect, too, that <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a> affirms nothing peculiar of the Gentile-Christians. <span class="ital">As standing in contrast to the</span> <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας εἶναι</span> <span class="ital">of the Jewish-Christians</span>, what is said in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a> serves precisely to characterize the Gentile-Christians. They, without having entertained that previous hope (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>), have heard, believed, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The usual construction, suggested of itself by the very sequence of the words, has been—after the example of Morus, Koppe, ed. 1, Flatt, and Matthies—departed from by Harless, followed by Olshausen, inasmuch as he regards <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> as an inserted clause [<span class="ital">incisum</span>]: “<span class="ital">we who were predestined</span>, etc., <span class="ital">to be those—to the praise of His glory—who already before hoped in Christ</span>.” In this way Paul would point to the reason, why the <span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span> had first been assigned to the Jews. But (1) in that case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΗΡΏΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΟΡΙΣΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> must already have applied specially to the <span class="ital">Jewish-Christians</span>, which no reader could guess and Paul, in order to his writing intelligibly, must have <span class="ital">indicated</span>, by putting it in some such way as: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ ἡμεῖς ἐκληρώθημεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ προορισθέντες</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοὺς προηλπικότας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. As the passage actually <span class="ital">stands</span>, the reader could find the Jewish-Christians designated only at <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>, not previously. (2) <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> has, in accordance with the context (see <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>; comp. also <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>), by no means the character of an incidental insertion, but the stress of defining the ultimate aim, and that not in respect of a pre-Christian state, but of the Christian one. This, however, only becomes suitably felt, when we <span class="ital">read</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς εἰς ἔπαινον δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> <span class="ital">together</span>. (3) The predestination of God (<span class="greekheb">προορισθέντες</span>) is in the connection related not to a <span class="ital">pre-Christian</span> state, such as, according to Harless, the <span class="greekheb">εἶναι τοὺς προηλπικότας ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριετῷ</span> would be, but to the realization of the Messianic blessedness (<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5</a>). Comp. <a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; as also <a href="/acts/4-28.htm" title="For to do whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done.">Acts 4:28</a>. Lastly, (4) the <span class="ital">objections</span> taken by Harless to the usual connection of the words are not tenable. For (<span class="ital">a</span>) the symmetry of the two corresponding sentences in form and thought <span class="ital">depends on the fact</span> that in the case of both sections, the Jewish and the Gentile Christians, the glorifying of, God is brought into prominence as the final aim of their attaining to salvation, and hence <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a> also closes with <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The repeated mention of the predestination on God’s part to salvation is solemn, not redundant; and the less so, inasmuch as the description of God as <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα ἐνεργοῦντος</span> is added. (<span class="ital">c</span>) The objection that we cannot tell why the apostle brings in that predestination only with regard to the <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότες</span>, while yet it manifestly applies also to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, is based on the misunderstanding, according to which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΛΗΡΏΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΟΡΙΣΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> are already restricted to the Jewish-Christians; for the subject of these words is still the Christians without distinction,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jewish and Gentile Christians,—so that the predestination <span class="ital">of those and these</span> is asserted. It is only at <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a> that the <span class="ital">division</span> of the subject begins, which is continued in<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[103] Many others, including Flatt, Meier, Harless, have attached <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι</span> to <span class="greekheb">προορισθ</span>.

The art. <span class="greekheb">τῆς</span> is inserted by the TR before <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span>, but on slender authority.

On the other hand, the <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> after <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span> is omitted by a few ancient authorities, especially [66]1[67].

It was not for our own privilege (as the Jews with their limited and exclusive ideas had misinterpreted the object of God in His election of them), but that through us His glory might be set forth. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the prophetic declaration, “the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise” (<a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>); and such passages as <a href="/psalms/144-12.htm" title="That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:">Psalm 144:12</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/39-10.htm" title="Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregation shall declare his praise.">Sir 39:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>. The sentence is best connected with the principal verb, not with the <span class="greekheb">προορισθέντες</span> which defines the <span class="greekheb">ἐκληρώθημεν</span>, but with the <span class="greekheb">ἐκληρώθημεν</span> itself. It is also to be taken as a whole, containing one idea, precisely as is the case with the other <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον</span> sentences in <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>. To break up the clause so as to take the <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς</span> to express the <span class="ital">end</span> or <span class="ital">object</span>, further defined by the <span class="greekheb">τοὺς προηλπικότας</span>, and to make <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> an incidental or parenthetical clause, is in the highest degree artificial and out of harmony with the other sentences. The question remains as to the persons included in the <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>—whether Christians generally, or Jews or Jewish Christians specially. In order to answer that question the force of the following clause must be determined.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς προηλπικότας ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ</span>: <span class="ital">we who had</span> (RV marg., “have”) <span class="ital">before trusted in Christ</span>. Better, <span class="ital">we, to wit, who have aforetime hoped in the Christ</span>. The article defining the <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας</span> is most naturally taken as placing the <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας</span> in <span class="ital">apposition</span> to the <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> and as explaining the <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> now in view to be a particular class, and not the subjects of God’s grace generally. The attempt is made, indeed, in more than one way (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Hofm., Harl., Abb., Haupt, etc.) to construe <span class="greekheb">τοὺς προηλπικότας</span> as the predicate, so that the sense should be, “to the end that we should be those who have before hoped (or believed) in Christ”. But this is not a construction naturally suggested by the simple form of the sentence. It has also the disadvantage of not being in harmony with what is the prevalent, though not invariable, use of the article as distinguishing subject from predicate, and it turns the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. awkwardly into a parenthetical sentence—“to the end that we, to the praise of His glory, should be those who have before hoped in Christ”. It is to be further noticed that the <span class="greekheb">προ</span> in <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας</span> must have its proper force, expressing a hope cherished before the event. Some understand this differently, taking the <span class="greekheb">προ</span> to express the fact that Jewish Christians <span class="ital">preceded</span> Gentile Christians in hoping in Christ (Beza, Grot., Beng., etc.). Others (De Wette, etc.) would make the event in view as the object of hope the <span class="ital">second</span> Advent of Christ, the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> of the Epistles. But the point appears to be that there were those, namely, pious Jews of OT times, who cherished a hope in the Christ of promise and prophecy before the appearance of Christ in history. The words are entirely appropriate as a description of those who looked for Christ before He came. The prep. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is most naturally understood as is the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> after the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίζειν</span>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίζειν</span> itself must have the natural sense of <span class="ital">hoping</span>, not <span class="ital">believing</span> or <span class="ital">trusting</span>. Yet, again, the object of the hope is here not <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, “<span class="ital">the</span> Christ,” “the Messiah”. The sense consequently is, “we, to wit, who have reposed our hope in the Christ before He appeared”. These things help us to answer the question—Who are the persons referred to? They are, say some, <span class="ital">Christians generally</span>, as those who hope in the Christ who is to return, and of whom it may be said, speaking of them from the standpoint of the final fulfilment at Christ’s second Advent, that they are those who have reposed their hope in the Christ who is to come. This is urged specially on the ground that, as all through the preceding paragraph Paul has spoken of things pertaining to Christians generally and has used the terms “we,” “us” of Christians without distinction, it is unreasonable to suppose that at this point he changes all and puts a restricted meaning on the <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>. On this view the following <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> must also be taken not as referring to a distinct class of Christians, but simply as applying to the Ephesian readers in particular what is said of all Christians as such. It must be allowed that much may be said in favour of this view. But on the other hand it is just at this point that Paul introduces a <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> as well as a <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>—a fact that naturally suggests a distinction between two classes; as in chap. <a href="/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;...">Ephesians 2:11-22</a> he draws out the distinction definitely and with a purpose between two classes who became believers in the Christ in different ways and at different times. Hence it appears simplest (with Mey., etc.) to regard Paul as speaking in this clause specially of those who like himself had once been Jews, who had the Messianic prophecies and looked for the Messiah, and by God’s grace had been led to see that in Christ they had found the Messiah. In the following <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, therefore, he refers to those who had once been Gentiles and had come to be believers in Christ. This is supported by the explanatory nature of the clause introduced by <span class="greekheb">τούς</span>, by the proper sense of the <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας</span>, and by the introduction of <span class="greekheb">τῷ Χριστῷ</span> in place of <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[66] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[67] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859. Its Greek text is almost identical with that of G, and it is therefore not cited save where it differs from that MS. Its Latin version, f, presents the Vulgate text with some modifications.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">That we should be</span>, &c.] On the <span class="ital">time when</span> of this, see next note but one, at the end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his glory</span>] His revealed Character, of which the Gospel of the Son is the grand illustration; being thus “the Gospel of the glory of the blissful God” (<a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1 Timothy 1:11</a>; and cp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, “the Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who first trusted in Christ</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">who have</span> (or, <span class="bld">had</span>) <span class="bld">hoped beforehand in Christ</span>. “<span class="ital">Trust</span>” here nearly represents “hope” (as perhaps quite, <a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>; <a href="/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.">Romans 15:12</a>); but, unless context forbids, the reference of hope to the <span class="ital">future</span> should always be recognized. And this is emphasized here by the “beforehand,” which in the Gr. is a part of the verb-form. What then is the precise <span class="ital">expectation about Christ</span> in view here? It may be either (1) that of Jewish believers, as e.g. the O. T. saints, and Symeon, &c., up to the First Advent; or (2) that of all believers up to the Second Advent; a view of Christ specially as the Coming One, in either case. Both interpretations find some support in the context. If (1) is adopted, the reference will be to Jewish believers as against Gentile, and their priority both in time and, in a certain sense, in claim, as holders of the great Messianic Hope; as if to say, “that we, who as Israelites had inherited and cherished that hope before it was fulfilled, and before it was imparted to you, should be, &c.” If (2) is adopted, the reference will be to the expectant attitude of all Christians till the Lord’s Return (cp. e.g. <a href="/context/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?...">Romans 8:24-25</a>, and note); at which Return they, in a final sense, will “be to the praise of His glory” (cp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>). To this reference we incline. The grandeur and universality of the scope of the whole passage favours it rather than the other; though it must not be forgotten on the other hand that this Epistle is often specially occupied with contrasts between Jew and Gentile.—Thus paraphrase; “That we should contribute to the glory of God, at the appearing of Christ; welcomed then as the once patient and expectant believers in His promise while still it tarried.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">us</span>) Jews.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς προηλπικότας</span>, <span class="ital">who before</span> or <span class="ital">first hoped</span> or <span class="ital">trusted</span>) This is the predicate. The Jews first obtained hope in Christ when manifested to them (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>); afterwards the Gentiles, <a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>.

The first "we" in this verse embraces all, as in the preceding part of the chapter; the second (omitted in the A.V.) is conditioned by the words following, and is applicable to the Jewish Christians, who, through the promises given to the fathers, had seen Christ's day afar off, and had thus hoped in him. This special reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is followed immediately by a reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That we should be<p>Connect with we were made a heritage.<p>Who first trusted (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>In apposition with we (should be). So Rev., we who had, etc., trusted, more properly hoped; and first trusted is ambiguous. We refers to Jewish Christians, and the verb describes their messianic hope before (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;) the advent of Christ. Hence Rev., correctly, we who had (have) before hoped. In Christ should be "in the Christ," as the subject of messianic expectation and not as Jesus, for whom Christ had passed into a proper name. It is equivalent to in the Messiah.
