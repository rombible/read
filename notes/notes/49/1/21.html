when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>, generally for all created powers whatever. But St. Paul mostly employs this whole group of words, especially in the Epistles of the Captivity, with a manifest reference to angelic powers of good or evil. Thus in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a> we read, of “angels, and principalities, and powers” (as in <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1Peter 3:22</a>, “angels, and authorities, and powers”); in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> of this Epistle, of “principalities and powers in the heavenly places;” and in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>, of “wrestling <span class= "ital">not against flesh and blood, </span>but against principalities and powers,” &c.; and in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, of “things in heaven and earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers.” It is likely that he was induced so to do by the half-Gnostic speculation on the nature and worship of angels, prevalent in the later Judaism, of which we have a specimen at Colossæ (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>)—in the same spirit which leads the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews to dwell so emphatically (in Ephesians 1, 2) on the infinite superiority of the Son of God to all angels. We observe that his references to these orders or aspects of the angelic hierarchy vary both in fulness and in order. (Comp., for instance, this passage with <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.) Hence we gain no encouragement for the elaborate speculation in which men have indulged as to the right succession and relation of the hosts of heaven. In this passage the names rather point to different aspects, than to different orders, of superhuman power. The first two words signify appointed government and the authority which is committed to it; the last two the actual force and the moral force of dignity or lordship in which it is clothed. In the Colossian passage the words here placed first come last, though in the same mutual connection, and the words “dignities or lordships” is connected with the word “thrones,” not here found. His purpose is, indeed, better served by this comparative vagueness: for that purpose is to exalt the majesty of our Lord over all other, whatever it may be, and whatever name it may wear.<p><span class= "bld">Not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</span>—The word “world” is here <span class= "ital">age, </span>and the antithesis is exactly that of our Lord’s words in <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a> (see Note there). Manifestly, however, it here signifies “this life” (or <span class= "ital">dispensation</span>) and “the future life,” that is, the life on this side, and on the other side, of the Second Coming of Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Far above all principality - The general sense in this verse is, that the Lord Jesus was exalted to the highest conceivable dignity and honor; compare <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>. In this beautiful and most important passage, the apostle labors for words to convey the greatness of his conceptions, and uses those which denote the highest conceivable dignity and glory. The "main" idea is, that God had manifested great "power" in thus exalting the Lord Jesus, and that similar power was exhibited in raising up the sinner from the death of sin to the life and honor of believing. The work of religion throughout was a work of power; a work of exalting and honoring "the dead," whether dead in sin or in the grave; and Christians ought to know the extent and glory of the power thus put forth in their salvation. The word rendered "far above" - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  huperano&#772; - is a compound word, meaning "high above," or greatly exalted. He was not merely "above" the ranks of the heavenly beings, as the head; he was not one of their own rank, placed by office a little above them, but he was infinitely exalted over them, as of different rank and dignity. How could this be if he were a mere man; or if he were an angel? The word rendered "principality" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;  arche&#772; - means properly, "the beginning;" and then the first, the first place, power, dominion, pre-eminence, rulers. magistrates, etc. It may refer here to any rank and power, whether among people or angels, and the sense is, that Christ is exalted above all.<p>And power - It is not easy to distinguish between the exact meaning of the words which the apostle here uses. The general idea is, that Christ is elevated above all ranks of creatures, however exalted. and by whatever name they may be known. As in this he refers to the "world that is to come," as well as this world, it is clear that there is a reference here to the ranks of the angels, and probably he means to allude to the prevailing opinion among the Jews, that the angels are of different orders. Some of the Jewish rabbies reckon four, others ten orders of angels, and they presume to give them names according to their different ranks and power. But all this is evidently the result of mere fancy. The Scriptures hint in several places at a difference of rank among the angels, but the sacred writers do not go into detail. It may be added that there is no improbability in such a subordination, but it is rather to be presumed to be true. The creatures of God are not made alike; and difference of degree and rank, as far as our observation extends everywhere prevails. On this verse compare the notes at <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>.<p>Dominion - Greek "Lordship."<p>And every name that is named - Every creature of every rank.<p>Not only in this world - Not only above all kings, and princes, and rulers of every grade and rank on earth.<p>But also in that which is to come - This refers undoubtedly to heaven. The meaning is, that he is Supreme over all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Greek, "Far (or high) above all (Eph 4:10) principality (or rule, 1Co 15:24), and authority, and power (Mt 28:18), and dominion (or lordship)." Compare Php 2:9; Col 1:16; Heb 7:26; 1Pe 3:22. Evil spirits (who are similarly divided into various ranks, Eph 6:12), as well as angels of light, and earthly potentates, are included (compare Ro 8:38). Jesus is "King of kings, and Lord of lords" (Re 19:16). The higher is His honor, the greater is that of His people, who are His members joined to Him, the Head. Some philosophizing teachers of the school of Simon Magus, in Western Asia Minor, had, according to Iren&aelig;us and Epiphanius, taught their hearers these names of various ranks of angels. Paul shows that the truest wisdom is to know Christ as reigning above them all.<p>every name&#8212;every being whatever.

Good angels and bad angels, and civil magistrates, who also may be intended by the following words: <p>and might and dominion; good angels may be so called, because of their employment under God in the affairs of Providence, and the government of this world; and Christ is not only above them, as he is God, being their Creator, who has made them, and on whom they depend, and is the Lord whom they serve, and is the object of their worship and adoration, and as he is Mediator, to whom they minister, and so is above them in nature, name, and office; but also as he is man, in union with the Son of God; and chiefly he here is said to be above them on account of place, being at the right hand of God, where they are not, <a href="/hebrews/1-13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>. And evil angels may be so called, because of the government which subsists among themselves, and the power and influence they have over mankind; Christ was above them when here on earth, as appears by his resisting the temptations of Satan, and defeating him in them; by his dispossessing devils from the bodies of men; by his spoiling and destroying them and their works at his death; and by his leading them captive, and triumphing over them at his ascension; and by delivering souls out of his hands at conversion, through his power attending the ministration of his Gospel; and his being above them will still be more manifest, in the binding of Satan a thousand years, and in the final condemnation of him, and of all his angels under him: civil magistrates are sometimes called by these names, and Christ is above them; they receive their governments from him, they rule by him, and are accountable to him, and are set up and put down at his pleasure; all these senses may be taken in; but the first seems chiefly designed: it is added, <p>and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; persons of authority and dignity, of fame and renown, whether in earth or heaven; as emperors, kings, princes, nobles, generals of armies &amp;c. in this world, and cherubim, seraphim, &amp;c. in the other world: this phrase denotes both the extensiveness of Christ's kingdom, and the eternity of it; as reaching to both worlds, and being over everything in them, and as lasting to the end of this, and unto that which is to come. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</span><p>(a) Everything, whatever it may be, or above all things, even if they are of ever so much power or excellency.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a> is no parenthesis, since neither the construction nor the logical progress of the thought is interrupted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω</span> expresses not the <span class="ital">infinite</span> exaltedness (the Greek Fathers, Beza, Estius), nor yet the <span class="ital">dominion over</span> (Bengel), although the latter is implied in the <span class="ital">nature of the case</span>, but simply: <span class="ital">up above</span> (<a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm" title="Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.">Ezekiel 8:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>; Cant. tr. puer. 37; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-3.htm" title="I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.">Tob 1:3</a>; Ael. <span class="ital">V.

More precise information, however, as to the relations and functions of the different grades of angels[116] is not to be given, since Paul does not himself enter into particulars on the point, and the Rabbinical theory of classes of angels, elaborated under the influence of Platonism, yet dissimilar (see Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">Entdeckt.

It is nevertheless probable that the order of succession is here arranged according to a <span class="ital">descending climax</span>; for (1) the apostle, in looking at the matter, proceeds most naturally <span class="ital">from above downward</span>, from the right hand of God to the heavenly beings which hold the <span class="ital">next</span> place beneath Him, and so on; (2) the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, and <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> are always mentioned in <span class="ital">the same</span> order (<a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>); the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, however, with the <span class="greekheb">θρόνοι</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>) are, <span class="ital">Test.

Even a purpose <span class="ital">of guarding against</span> possible infection on the part of such a Gnosis (Schneckenburger, Olshausen) is at least not expressed or more specially-indicated; it may, however, have still been partially present to the mind of the apostle from the sphere of thought of the previously composed Epistle to the Colossians.

The <span class="greekheb">πάσης</span> is “all” in the sense of “every,” every particular kind of <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> that can be named. The terms are given in the abstract form, not as if only <span class="ital">principles</span> and <span class="ital">forces</span> were in view, and not <span class="ital">personal</span> powers, but because “<span class="ital">classes</span> or <span class="ital">categories</span> of personal beings are expressed, just as, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> is said of human <span class="ital">authorities</span>, which consist of <span class="ital">persons</span>” (Mey.). The use of the abstract <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, etc., instead of the concrete <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, etc., enhances the conception of the absolute, all-embracing dominion of Christ. But what manner of powers or authorities do these terms designate? The fact that the immediate subject here is the <span class="ital">heavenlies</span> and Christ’s position in them at once excludes such interpretations as identify these <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, etc. with <span class="ital">earthly</span> powers (Morus); with every kind of dignity wheresoever found (Erasm., Olsh., etc.); with the Jewish hierarchy (Schoett.); or with the various orders of <span class="ital">Gentile</span> powers (van Til). The leading idea of the section and the apparent purport of similar statements (<a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>) point to the angelic world as meant. The fact that nothing is said here of Christ’s triumph over Satanic powers suggests further that only angels of good,—heavenly intelligences, are in view. Can any definite distinction then be made out between the terms? And can it be said that the enumeration means that the world of good angels has its distinct orders and grades of angelic dignity and power? The passage must be read in connection with the analogous enumerations in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>, and especially <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>. Differences in the enumerations then at once appear. In <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> we have only the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>; in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>; in <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>. And in the most direct parallel (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>) we find <span class="greekheb">θρόνοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κυριότητες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>. The Pauline passages themselves, therefore, show no such identity either in the <span class="ital">number</span> or in the <span class="ital">succession</span> of authorities as would be consistent with a determinate doctrine of graduated orders. Nor can it be inferred from the words in <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a> (as Meyer thinks) that such gradations are recognised by our Lord Himself. It is true that in the non-canonical writings of the Jews (<span class="ital">e.g., Test. XII. Patr.</span>, etc.) the idea of variety of ranks among the angels appears, and that in the later Rabbinical literature it took strange and elaborate forms. But between these and the simple statements of the NT there is no real likeness, and there is nothing here to point certainly either to an <span class="ital">ascending</span> scale or to a <span class="ital">descending</span>. It is held by some indeed (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Meyer) that the angelic authorities are named here according to the latter scale, beginning with the highest and proceeding to the lower and the lowest. For this two reasons are offered, <span class="ital">viz., first</span> that it would be natural for the writer, who has led the reader up to the right hand of God as the position possessed by Christ, to give his enumeration of the powers subject to Christ in the succession of first, second and third in rank; and <span class="ital">second</span>, that in the various references made to them, the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> are given in the same order. But the former is a very precarious reason; and the latter is not valid, inasmuch as in none of the passages appealed to do we get all these three terms together (<a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>). Nor is it possible to establish any clear distinction of sense and application between the four terms introduced here, such as that attempted, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Alford who, including in the list <span class="ital">earthly</span> as well as heavenly powers and <span class="ital">evil</span> as well as good spirits, regards <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> as the supreme expression of dignity, <span class="greekheb">ἐξπισία</span> as official power in all its forms, primary or delegated, <span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span> as <span class="ital">might</span> or the “raw material” of power, and <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span>, as the pre-eminence of lordship. We must take the terms, therefore, not as dogmatic terms either teaching or implying any doctrine of graduated ranks, differentiated functions, or organised order in the world of angels, but as rhetorical terms brought together in order to express the unique supremacy and absolute sovereignty proper to Christ, and meaning simply that whatever powers or dignities existed and by whatever names they might be designated, Christ’s dominion was above them all. This is suggested also by the further generalisation that follows.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ παντὸς ὀνόματος ὀνομαζομένου</span>: <span class="ital">and every name that is named</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα</span> here is not to be taken as a title of dignity, but (as the <span class="greekheb">ὀνομαζομένου</span> shows) has the simple sense of <span class="ital">name</span>. There is an advance in the statement of Christ’s supreme rank, but it is simply from the idea of a supremacy over all heavenly intelligences to that of a supremacy over all created objects by whatsoever name called.—<span class="greekheb">οὐμόνον ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι</span>: <span class="ital">not only in this world</span> (or <span class="ital">age</span>), <span class="ital">but also in that which is to come</span>. The statement of Christ’s absolute and unmatched supremacy is brought to its height by this last generalisation, which embraces within its sweep the totality of created objects not only as they now are, but as they may hereafter be in any possible future. The word <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> here as elsewhere, has the idea of <span class="ital">duration</span> at its foundation. It means “age,” “<span class="ital">aeon</span>,” and as used of the <span class="ital">world</span> presents it, in distinction from <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, in its temporal aspect, “this present state of things”. The Jews spoke of the period before Messiah’s Advent as <span class="greekheb">הָצוֹלָם הַוֶּה</span>, “this age,” and of the period introduced by that event as <span class="greekheb">הָצוֹלָם הַבָּא</span>, “the coming age”. So the NT writers designate the period preceding the final Return or Parousia of Christ <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰὼν οὗτος</span> (also <span class="greekheb">ὁ νῦν αἰών</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐνεστὼς αἰών</span>, <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; or simply <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰών</span>, <a href="/matthew/14-22.htm" title="And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.">Matthew 14:22</a>), and the period beginning with the Parousia <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰὼν ὁ μέλλων</span> (also <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰὼν ἐκεῖνος</span>, <a href="/luke/20-35.htm" title="But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:">Luke 20:35</a>; <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰὼν ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, <a href="/mark/10-30.htm" title="But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="/luke/18-30.htm" title="Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.">Luke 18:30</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">οἱ αἰῶνες οἱ ἐπερχόμενοι</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This paragraph gives simply a positive statement of the exaltation of Christ, His sovereign and unshared supremacy over all. It makes no reference to Jewish or Gnostic speculations inconsistent with this. It is different with the great section in the sister Epistle to the Colossians. There we see that such speculations were rife in at least one of the Churches of the Lycus valley. The statements in that Epistle have an unmistakable reference to theosophic notions akin to the Gnostic ideas of emanations—notions of angelic intermediaries between God and the world; against which the Apostle has to assert the exclusive relation of Christ to the whole system of things, seen and unseen, earthly and celestial, as the Creator of all, the Upholder of all, the One Being in whom resided all the forces pertaining to the maintenance and administration of things. The literature of Judaism makes it also clear that by Paul’s time the Jews had constructed a somewhat elaborate system of Angelology, with theories of graduated positions and distinctive functions. <span class="ital">The Book of Enoch</span> (lxi. 10) speaks of “angels of power and angels of principality”. <span class="ital">The Book of the Secrets of Enoch</span> (xx. 1, 3) describes the heavenly host as consisting of ten troops—lordships, principalities, powers, cherubim, seraphim, thrones, etc. In the <span class="ital">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span> (Levi 3) six orders are named, of which the highest are the <span class="greekheb">θρόνοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, occupying the seventh heaven, while the <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> are the fifth in order and are assigned to the third heaven. The same general doctrine appears also in Ephraem Syrus (i., p. 270), who gives three great divisions of the celestial world, <span class="ital">viz.</span> (1) <span class="greekheb">θεοί</span>, <span class="greekheb">θρόνοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κυριότητες</span>; (2) <span class="greekheb">ἀρχάλλελοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>; (3) <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>, <span class="greekheb">χερουβίμ</span>, <span class="greekheb">σεραφίμ</span>. In the <span class="ital">De Princip.</span> of Origen (i., 5, 3, etc.) five orders are named, rising from the <span class="greekheb">τάξις ἀγγελική</span>, to <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">θρόνοι</span>, and finally <span class="greekheb">κυριότητες</span>. But the conception of a great, graduated angelic hierarchy was elaborated most fully by the author of the remarkable book, <span class="ital">De Coelesti Hierarchia</span>, the so-called Dionysius the Areopagite. There we find a scheme of orders in three sets of three, descending from the highest to the lowest: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones; Dominations, Virtues, Powers (or Authorities); Principalities, Archangels, Angels. Hence the sublime description in Dante (<span class="ital">Paradiso</span>, canto xxxviii.) and Milton’s “Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers” (<span class="ital">Paradise Lost</span>, v., 601).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑπεράνω</span>) A compound word.

Hardly anything is revealed to us on the various orders of the spiritual powers, unfallen and fallen; and the speculations on them in which the Fathers used to indulge are of no value; but whatever may be true of them, Christ is exalted far above them all - far above every creature in earth, heaven, or hell (comp. <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>; <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>; <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</span> The pro-eminence of his Name is to be eternal.

In the world to come, it shall ever shine forth with an unapproached effulgence. All this is said to exalt our sense of the Divine power that so raised up and exalted the God-Man, Christ Jesus - the same power that still works in believers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Far above (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;)<p>Lit., over above.
