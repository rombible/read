As it is, the sight of a child near the hole of the asp (the <span class= "ital">cobra</span>) or cockatrice (better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">basilisk, </span>the great viper), would make its mother scream with terror. There was still “enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent” (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>), but in the far-off reign of the Christ even that enmity should disappear, and the very symbols of evil, subtle, malignant, venomous, should be reconciled to humanity. Some critics translate the last clause, “<span class= "ital">shall stretch out his hand to the eye-ball of the basilisk</span>” as if alluding to the power of fascination commonly assigned to it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signify a small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. He comes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cut down and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. The house of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. The Messiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world. But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abide upon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, Col 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are here mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spirit is here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in all his government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of his Spirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quiet under his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes those who trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind to them. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature of troubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall not do any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed into the same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likeness to him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread. And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age of Christianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yet arrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may help to promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the sucking child - An emblem here of harmlessness and innocence.

He shall play over that place as safely as if the nature of the asp was changed, and it had become innocuous. The Hebrew word rendered here "asp" (&#1508;&#1514;&#1503;  pethen) denotes the serpent usually called the asp, whose poison is of such rapid operation that it kills almost instantly: see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14</a>, <a href="/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>. The word occurs in no other places in the Old Testament. This serpent is small. It is found particularly in Egypt, though also in other places; see the note at <a href="/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14</a>. It is used here as the emblem of the more sudden, malignant, and violent passions; and the idea is, that under the Messiah a change would be performed in people of malignant and deadly passions as signal "as if" the asp or adder were to lose his venom, and become innocuous to a child.<p>And the weaned child - But still, a young and helpless child.

In all these places, it is rendered cockatrice, except in <a href="/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>. The "cockatrice" was a fabulous kind of serpent, supposed to be hatched from the egg of a cock. The serpent here designated is, doubtless, a species of the "adder," more venomous, perhaps, than the &#1508;&#1514;&#1503;  pethen, but still belonging to the same species. Bochart ("Hieroz." P. ii. lib. iii. ch. ix.) supposes that the "basilisk" is intended - a species of serpent that, he says, was supposed to poison even with its breath. The general idea is the same here as above. It is in vain to attempt to spiritualize these expressions, and to show that they refer to certain individuals, or that the animals here designated refer to particular classes of the enemies of the gospel. It is a mere poetic description, denoting great peace and security; and all the changes in the mad, malignant, and envenomed passions of people, that may be necessary to produce and perpetuate that peace. Pope has versified this description in the following beautiful manner:<p>The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead,<p>And boys, in flowery bands, the tigers lead.<p>The steer and lion at one crib shall meet,<p>And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim's feet.<p>The smiling infant in his hand shall take<p>The crested basilisk, and speckled snake;<p>Pleased, the green luster of the scales survey,<p>And, with their forked tongue, shall innocently play.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. play&#8212;literally, "delight" himself in sport.<p>cockatrice&#8212;a fabulous serpent supposed to be hatched from the egg of a cock.

"The Spirit of Jehovah" (ruach Yehovah) is the Divine Spirit, as the communicative vehicle of the whole creative fulness of divine powers. Then follow the six spirits, comprehended by the ruach Yehovah in three pairs, of which the first relates to the intellectual life, the second to the practical life, and the third to the direct relation to God. For chocma&#770;h (wisdom) is the power of discerning the nature of things through the appearance, and b&#305;&#772;na&#770;h (understanding) the power of discerning the differences of things in their appearance; the former is &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, the latter &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; or &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. "Counsel" (etza&#770;h) is the gift of forming right conclusions, and "might" (gebu&#772;ra&#770;h) the ability to carry them out with energy. "The knowledge of Jehovah" (da&#8219;ath Yehovah) is knowledge founded upon the fellowship of love; and "the fear of Jehovah" (yir'ath Yehova&#770;h), fear absorbed in reverence. There are seven spirits, which are enumerated in order from the highest downwards; since the spirit of the fear of Jehovah is the basis of the whole (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>), and the Spirit of Jehovah is the heart of all.
