The words admit, however, of being taken as a generalised statement: “None shall hurt nor destroy <span class= "bld">. . .</span>” The “holy mountain “is none other than the “mountain of the Lord’s house” of <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a> in its future apocalyptic glory (<a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>), but may, perhaps, include the whole of the hill-country of Israel, as in <a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm" title="When you cry, let your companies deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;">Isaiah 57:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-54.htm" title="And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.">Psalm 78:54</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm" title="You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.">Exodus 15:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</span>—If, as some have thought, the “earth” here should be the <span class= "ital">land </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in <a href="/isaiah/9-19.htm" title="Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.">Isaiah 9:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm" title="For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the middle of all the land.">Isaiah 10:23</a>, the land of Judah), that region is represented as the paradise centre of a restored world, to which, as in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>, all nations turn for light and blessing. Probably, however, the words may be taken in their wider significance. This was for the prophet the crown and consummation of the work of redemption. More than all removal of physical evil, he thought of a victory over moral and spiritual darkness. As it is, in the existing order of the world, few fear God; still fewer know Him as He should be known. But in that new earth “the knowledge of Jehovah” shall flow far and wide. Even as the waters of the Mediterranean (the sea which must have suggested the prophet’s comparison) washed the shores of the far-off isles of the Gentiles, the coasts of Chittim (<a href="/numbers/24-24.htm" title="And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.">Numbers 24:24</a>), as well as those of Israel, so should the knowledge of the truth of God expand beyond the limits of the people of Israel. Hence the transition was natural to the prophecies which speak at once of the restoration of Israel and the in-gathering of the heathen. It should be remembered that in <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="/joel/3-17.htm" title="So shall you know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.">Joel 3:17</a>, prophecies like in kind had preceded Isaiah’s utterance. In <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm" title="For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Habakkuk 2:14</a> it is all but verbally reproduced.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain </span>— Here the prophet himself gives us a key wherewith to open his meaning in the three preceding verses. By the <span class="ital">holy mountain </span>he means, the Christian Church, frequently termed <span class="ital">Zion, Jerusalem, </span>and God’s <span class="ital">holy mountain, </span>in the writings of the prophets. Wherever the gospel comes and prevails; wherever the true and genuine religion of Christ takes place and is established, these effects are produced. And in due time the gospel shall prevail, and the true religion of Jesus be established everywhere. <span class="ital">For the earth </span>— The world, with its inhabitants, <span class="ital">shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord </span>— By this he intimates, that all that savageness and malignity which are in carnal and wicked men toward the people of God, and all those unholy, unkind, and unhappy dispositions which are in any of the human race, proceed from their ignorance of God, or their want of a true and saving acquaintance with him, which, wherever it takes place, produces a marvellous and thorough change in men’s hearts and lives. <span class="ital">As the waters cover the sea </span>— As the waters spread themselves over the bottom, and entirely fill all the channels of the sea. Although this prophecy begins to be fulfilled wherever the kingdom of grace is set up among men, and is more and more fulfilled in proportion as that kingdom is enlarged; yet the perfect accomplishment of it will not be witnessed till those latter days come, when, according to the Scriptures, the knowledge and practice of Christianity will be universally diffused, and all those divine virtues which it inculcates will be most eminently exerted and displayed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signify a small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. He comes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cut down and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. The house of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. The Messiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world. But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abide upon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, Col 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are here mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spirit is here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in all his government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of his Spirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quiet under his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes those who trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind to them. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature of troubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall not do any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed into the same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likeness to him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread. And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age of Christianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yet arrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may help to promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall not hurt - That is, those who are designated above under the emblems of the lion, the leopard, the bear, and the adder.<p>Nor destroy in all my holy mountain - Mount Zion; used here, as elsewhere, to denote the seat of his reign on the earth, or his church; the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>.

The earth shall be full of a correct understanding of the existence, perfections, plans, and claims of God; and shall be disposed to yield to those claims - thus producing universal peace.<p>As the waters cover the sea - That is, the depths or the bottom of the sea; compare <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>. The vast waters of the ocean cover all its depths, find their way into all the caverns, flow into all the recesses on the shore - and thus shall the knowledge of Yahweh spread like deep, flowing waters, until the earth shall be pervaded and covered with it. It is evident that a time is here spoken of which has not yet fully come, and the mind is still directed onward, as was that of the prophet, to a future period when this shall be accomplished. The prophecy has been indeed in part fulfilled. Wherever the gospel has spread, its effect has been just that which is predicted here. It has calmed and subdued the angry passions of people; changed their feelings and their conduct; disposed them to peace; and tended to mitigate national ferocity, to produce kindness to captives, and to those who had been oppressed. It has mitigated laws that were cruel and bloody; and has abolished customs, games, sports, and pastimes that were ferocious and savage. It has often changed the bitter persecutor, as it did Saul of Tarsus, to the mildness and gentleness of a lamb; and it has spread an influence over nations tending to produce humanity and benevolence. It has produced mildness, gentleness, and love, in the domestic circle; changed a the cruel and lordly husband to a companion and friend; and the character of the stern and inexorable father to one of paternal kindness and peace. Wherever it has spread "in truth" and not "in form merely," it has shed a mild, calming, and subduing influence over the passions, laws, and customs of people. But its effects have been but partially felt; and we are led, therefore, to look forward to future times, when the prophecy shall be entirely fulfilled, and the power of the gospel shall be felt in all nations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. my holy mountain&#8212;Zion, that is, Jerusalem.

In the Church, so called, in allusion to the holy hill of Zion; in the latter day, after the destruction of antichrist, there will be no more persecution of the saints; they will be no more injured nor harassed by wicked men, comparable to the above mentioned creatures, either for their cruelty or cunning; the reason follows: <p>for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea: full of the Gospel, the means of conveying the knowledge of Christ, and of God in Christ, of his person and office, of his grace and righteousness, of peace, pardon, life, and salvation by him. The phrase denotes the abundance and depth of the knowledge of divine things, and the large spread of the Gospel, and the multitude of persons that shall be blessed with it, and a profound knowledge of it; so that there will be none to molest, disturb, and distress the people of God, see <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a> this has had some appearance of accomplishment at several times; as at the first times of the Gospel, when the sound of it, by the apostles, went into all the earth, and diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ in every place; and in the times of Constantine, when Paganism was abolished, and the whole empire became Christian, persecution ceased, and peace ensued, as before described; and at the Reformation, when whole nations embraced the Gospel of Christ; but the full accomplishment of it is yet to come, when the angel shall fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach to all men, and the earth shall be lightened with his glory; when men shall run to and fro, and knowledge be increased, and all shall know the Lord, from the least to the greatest.

As the Jewish Church is always bound up with the "holy hill of Zion," so the Messianic one receives the designation of "the mountain of the Lord" (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), or "the holy mountain" (<a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>). What was physically true of the type is transferred to the antitype, which is "a city set upon a hill" in a certain sense. <span class="cmt_word">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</span> (romp. <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28</a>:29). A fruitful knowledge, guiding and influencing conduct, seems to be intended (see below, <a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children"). <span class="cmt_word">As the waters cover the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "as the ocean covers and fills the bed prepared for it." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And His regal conduct is regulated by this His thoroughly spiritual nature."And fear of Jehovah is fragrance to Him; and He judges not according to outward sight, neither does He pass sentence according to outward hearing." We must not render it: His smelling is the smelling of the fear of God, i.e., the penetration of it with a keen judicial insight (as Hengstenberg and Umbreit understand it); for he&#772;r&#305;&#772;ach with the preposition Beth has not merely the signification to smell (as when followed by an accusative, <a href="/job/39-25.htm">Job 39:25</a>), but to smell with satisfaction (like &#1489;&#1468; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, to see with satisfaction), <a href="/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>; <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>. The fear of God is that which He smells with satisfaction; it is re&#772;ach n&#305;&#772;choach to Him. Meier's objection, that fear of God is not a thing that can be smelt, and therefore that he&#772;r&#305;&#772;ach must signify to breathe, is a trivial one. Just as the outward man has five senses for the material world, the inner man has also a sensorium for the spiritual world, which discerns different things in different ways. Thus the second David scents the fear of God, and only the fear of God, as a pleasant fragrance; for the fear of God is a sacrifice of adoration continually ascending to God. His favour or displeasure does not depend upon brilliant or repulsive external qualities; He does not judge according to outward appearances, but according to the relation of the heart to His God. </body></html>
