From this victorious onset in the West, they are to pass on to “the children of the East,” the generic name for the nomadic tribes that are found associated with the Midianites and Amalekites (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="/judges/6-33.htm" title="Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.">Judges 6:33</a>; <a href="/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>), and in <a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>, with the Philistines themselves, and then to complete their triumph by avenging themselves on their old enemies of Edom, and Moab, and Ammon. The whole verse is singularly characteristic of what has been already spoken of as the limitation of prophetic knowledge. The seer has had revealed to him the glory of the Messianic kingdom as a restored Eden, full of the knowledge of Jehovah, the Gentiles seeking light and salvation from it. Suddenly he blends this with anticipations that belong to the feelings and complications of his own time. He sees Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, in that far future. They will be then, as they were in his own times, the persistent foes of Israel (comp. <a href="/context/zephaniah/2-7.htm" title="And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.">Zephaniah 2:7-9</a>), but will be, at last, subdued.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But they shall fly - The design of this verse is, to show the rapid and certain spiritual conquests which would result from the conversion of the scattered Jewish people. The Jews understood this literally, as referring to the conquests over their enemies. But if the exposition which has been given of this chapter thus far is correct, the passage is to be interpreted as a figurative description of the triumph of the people of God under the Messiah. The "time" to which it refers, is that which shall succeed the conversion of the scattered Jews. The "effect" of the gospel is represented under an image which, to Jews, would be most striking - that of conquest over the neighboring nations with whom they had been continually at war. Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Ammon, had been always the enemies of Judea; and to the Jews, no figurative representation could be more striking than that, "after" the union of Judah and Ephraim, they should proceed in rapid and certain conquest to subdue their ancient and formidable enemies. The meaning of the phrase 'they shall fly,' is, they shall hasten with a rapid motion, like a bird. They shall do it quickly, without delay, as an eagle hastens to its prey. It indicates their "suddenly" engaging in this, and the celerity and certainty of their movements. As the united powers of Judah and Ephraim would naturally make a sudden descent on Philistia, so the Jews, united under the Messiah, would go to the rapid and certain conversion of those who had been the enemies of the cross.<p>Upon the shoulders - &#1489;&#1499;&#1514;&#1507;  beka&#770;the&#770;ph. There has been a great variety in the interpretation of this passage; and it is evident that our translation does not express a very clear idea. The Septuagint renders it, 'And they shall fly in the ships of foreigners, and they shall plunder the sea.' The Chaldee, 'And they shall be joined with one shoulder, that is, they shall be "united" shoulder to shoulder, that they may smite the Philistines who are in the west.' The Syriac, 'But they shall "plow" the Philistines;' that is, they shall subdue them, and cultivate their land. The word rendered, 'shoulder,' means, properly, "the shoulder," as of a man or beast <a href="/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; <a href="/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-4.htm">Ezekiel 24:4</a>; the undersetters or shoulders to support the lavers <a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a>; a corner or side of a building <a href="/exodus/38-14.htm">Exodus 38:14</a>; and is applied to "the side" of anything, as the side of a building, the border of a country, a city, or sea (<a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10-11</a>, ...) Here it seems to mean, not that the Jews would be borne "upon" the shoulder of the Philistines, but that they would make a sudden and rapid descent "upon their borders:" they would invade their territory, and carry their conquest 'toward the west.' The construction is, therefore, 'they shall make a rapid descent on the borders of the Philistines,' or, in other words, the spiritual conquest over the enemies of the church of God shall be certain and rapid.<p>The Philistines - Philistia was situated on the southwestern side of the land of Canaan. The Philistines were therefore adjacent to the Jews, and were often involved in war with them. They were among the most constant and formidable enemies which the Jews had.<p>Toward the west - This does not mean that they should be borne on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; but that they should make a sudden and rapid descent on the Philistines, who "were" west of them. It stands opposed to the nations immediately mentioned as lying "east" of the land of Judea.<p>They shall spoil - They shall plunder; or, they shall take them, and their towns and property, as the spoil of war. That is, they shall vanquish them, and make them subject to them. According to the interpretation which has been pursued in this chapter, it means, that the enemies of God shall be subdued, and brought to the knowledge of the truth, in a rapid and decisive manner. The language is that which is drawn from the idea of conquest; the idea is that of a rapid and far-spreading conversion among the nations, to the gospel.<p>Them of the east - Hebrew, 'The sons of the east; that is, the nations east of Judea.<p>They shall lay their hand - Hebrew, 'Edom and Moab shall be the laying on of their hand;' that is, they shall lay their hand on those nations for conquest and spoil; they shall subdue them.<p>Edom - Idumea; the country settled by the descendants of Esau - a country that was south of Judea, and extended from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic gulf of the Red Sea. They were an independent people until the time of David, and were reduced to subjection by him, but they afterward revolted and became again independent. They were often engaged in wars with the Jews, and their conquest was an object that was deemed by the Jews to be very desirable (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>.)<p>And Moab - The country of the Moabites was east of the river Jordan, on both sides of the river Arnon, and adjoining the Dead Sea. Their capital was on the river Arnon. They also were often involved in wars with the Jews (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1-14</a>.)<p>And the children of Ammon - The Ammonites, the descendants of Ammon, a son of Lot. Their country lay southeast of Judea <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19-21</a>. Their territory extended from the river Arnon north to the river Jabbok, and from the Jordan far into Arabia. It was directly north of Moab, They were often engaged, in alliance with the Moabites, in waging war against the Jews.<p>Shall obey them - Hebrew, 'Shall be their obedience.' All these descriptions are similar. They are not to be interpreted literally, but are designed to denote the rapid triumphs of the truth of God after the conversion of the Jews; and the sense is, that the conquests of the gospel will be as sudden, as great, and as striking over its enemies, as would have been the complete subjugation of Philistia, Moab, Ammon, and Edom, to the victorious army of the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The Philistines were the sworn enemies of the Israelites, and lay to the west of the land of Israel, and when the Gospel was sent into all the world, it began to be preached in the parts of Palestine, whereby many were converted, and embraced it, as foretold they should, <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a> and flying upon their shoulders, as it denotes the conquest of them, and their subjection to the Gospel, so the swiftness of the apostles in carrying it to them, when they had a commission to do it, who were all of them Jews, of one tribe or another; and these may also design the enemies of the people of God now, the antichristian states, some of which will fall off from Popery, receive the Gospel, hate the whore, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire; which will be brought about by the preaching of the Gospel by its ministers, who will fly in the midst of heaven, and upon the shoulders of the Romish antichrist, and proclaim the fall of Babylon, and call upon, the Lord's people to come out of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>, <p>they shall spoil them of the east together; the Syrians and Arabians, who lay east of Judea; perhaps the Turks are meant, and the destruction of the Ottoman empire, whereby way will be made for the kings and kingdoms of the east to know, receive, and profess the Gospel of Christ, <a href="/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>. <p>they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; or "there shall be a sending out of their hand"; that is, they shall stretch out their hand, and lay hold on these people, and bring them into subjection to them; which is to be understood of the sending out of the Gospel, by the hands of the ministers of it, into those countries where the Moabites and Edomites formerly dwelt; and thereby bringing them into subjection to Christ and his churches: <p>and the children of Ammon shall obey them; that have the rule in the house of God, submitting to the laws and ordinances of Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">they shall fly</span>] or <span class="bld">swoop</span>, as a bird of prey (<a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>).

A further promise is made that physical difficulties shall not prevent the return of the Jewish exiles from distant countries (vers. 15, 16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines</span>. It is not to be supposed that actual war is intended. The subjects of the Prince of Peace will not draw the sword. But the Church will for many centuries be confronted by enemies, and must contend with them with legitimate weapons. It is this warfare of which Isaiah now speaks.

The phrase is commonly used in an ethnic sense of the nomadic Arabs inhabiting the deserts east of Jordan, beyond the Ammonite and Moabite country, from whose raids Palestine frequently suffered (see <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28, 29</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4, 10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fruit of righteousness is peace, which now reigns in humanity under the rule of the Prince of Peace, and even in the animal world, with nothing whatever to disturb it. "And the wolf dwells with the lamb, and the leopard lies down with the kid; and calf and lion and stalled ox together: a little boy drives them. And cow and bear go to the pasture; their young ones lie down together: and the lion eats shopped straw like the ox. And the suckling plays by the hole of the adder, and the weaned child stretches its hand to the pupil of the basilisk-viper. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the land is filled with knowledge of Jehovah, like the waters covering the sea." The fathers, and such commentators as Luther, Calvin, and Vitringa, have taken all these figures from the animal world as symbolical. Modern rationalists, on the other hand, understand them literally, but regard the whole as a beautiful dream and wish. It is a prophecy, however, the realization of which is to be expected on this side of the boundary between time and eternity, and, as Paul has shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, is an integral link in the predestined course of the history of salvation (Hengstenberg, Umbreit, Hofmann, Drechsler). There now reign among irrational creatures, from the greatest to the least, - even among such as are invisible, - fierce conflicts and bloodthirstiness of the most savage kind. But when the Son of David enters upon the full possession of His royal inheritance, the peace of paradise will be renewed, and all that is true in the popular legends of the golden age be realized and confirmed. This is what the prophet depicts in such lovely colours. The wolf and lamb, those two hereditary foes, will be perfectly reconciled then. The leopard will let the teazing kid lie down beside it. The lion, between the calf and stalled ox, neither seizes upon its weaker neighbour, nor longs for the fatter one. Cow and bear graze together, whilst their young ones lie side beside in the pasture. The lion no longer thirsts for blood, but contents itself, like the ox, with chopped straw. The suckling pursues its sport (pilpel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, mulcere) by the adder's hole, and the child just weaned stretches out its hand boldly and fearlessly to me'u&#772;rath tziph&#8219;o&#772;ni. It is evident from <a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a> that tziph&#8219;o&#772;ni is the name of a species of snake. According to Aquila and the Vulgate, it is basiliskos, serpens regulus, possibly from tzaph, to pipe or hiss (Ges., Frst); for Isidorus, in his Origg. xii. 4, says, Sibilus idem est qui et regulus; sibilo enim occidit, antequam mordeat vel exurat. For the hapax leg. ha&#770;da&#770;h, the meaning dirigere, tendere, is established by the Arabic; but there is all the more uncertainty about the meaning of the hap. leg. &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;. According to the parallel &#1495;&#1512;, it seems to signify the hollow (Syr., Vulg., lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;): whether from &#1488;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, from which comes &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;; or from &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, the light-hole (like &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, which occurs in the Mishna, Ohaloth xiii. 1) or opening where a cavern opens to the light of day. It is probable, however, that me'u&#772;ra&#770;h refers to something that exerts an attractive influence upon the child, either the "blending of colours" (Saad. renders tziph&#8219;oni, errakas', the motley snake), or better still, the "pupil of the eye" (Targum), taking the word as a feminine of ma&#770;'o&#772;r, the light of the eye (b. Erubin 55b - the power of vision). The look of a snake, more especially of the basilisk (not merely the basilisk-lizard, but also the basilisk-viper), was supposed to have a paralyzing and bewitching influence; but now the snake will lose this pernicious power (<a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>), and the basilisk become so tame and harmless, as to let children handle its sparkling eyes as if they were jewels. All this, as we should say with Luthardt and Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, 567), is only colouring which the hand of the prophet employs, for the purpose of painting the peace of that glorified state which surpasses all possibility of description; and it is unquestionably necessary to take the thought of the promise in a spiritual sense, without adhering literally to the medium employed in expressing it. But, on the other hand, we must guard against treating the description itself as merely a drapery thrown around the actual object; whereas it is rather the refraction of the object in the mind of the prophet himself, and therefore a manifestation of the true nature of that which he actually saw. <p>But are the animals to be taken as the subject in <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a> also? The subject that most naturally suggests itself is undoubtedly the animals, of which a few that are alarming and destructive to men have been mentioned just before. And the fact that they really are thought of as the subject, is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, where <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> is repeated in a compendious form. The idea that &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; requires men as the subject, is refuted by the common &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (compare the parallel promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>, which rests upon <a href="/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>). That the term yashchithu can be applied to animals, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>, and may be assumed as a matter of course. But if the animals are the subject, har kodshi (my holy mountain) is not Zion-Moriah, upon which wild beasts never made their home in historical times; but, as the generalizing col (all) clearly shows, the whole of the holy mountain-land of Israel: har kodshi has just this meaning in <a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a> (cf., <a href="/psalms/78-54.htm">Psalm 78:54</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>). The fact that peace prevails in the animal world, and also peace between man and beast, is then attributed to the universal prevalence of the knowledge of God, in consequence of which that destructive hostility between the animal world and man, by which estrangement and apostasy from God were so often punished (<a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>, etc.: see also <a href="/isaiah/7-24.htm">Isaiah 7:24</a>), have entirely come to an end. The meaning of "the earth" is also determined by that of "all my holy mountain." The land of Israel, the dominion of the Son of David in the more restricted sense, will be from this time forward the paradisaical centre, as it were, of the whole earth - a prelude of its future state of perfect and universal glorification (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, "all the earth"). It has now become full of "the knowledge of Jehovah," i.e., of that experimental knowledge which consists in the fellowship of love (&#1491;&#1506;&#1492;, like &#1500;&#1491;&#1492;, is a secondary form of &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, the more common infinitive or verbal noun from &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;: Ges. 133, 1), like the waters which cover the sea, i.e., bottom of the sea (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>, where la&#770;da&#8219;ath is a virtual accusative, full of that which is to be known). "Cover:" cissa&#770;h l' (like sa&#770;cac l', <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>), signifies to afford a covering to another; the Lamed is frequently introduced with a participle (in Arabic regularly) as a sign of the object (Ewald, 292, e), and the omission of the article in the case of mecassim is a natural consequence of the inverted order of the words. </body></html>
