Art thou weak? I will strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee in the time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with that right hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards and punishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seek their ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God's time. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised and trampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God's word is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear little in his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. The Lord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will make him fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment in the triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers of Christ, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supply all their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want, and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in the world, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constant supply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace, rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, Joh 7:38,39. When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be a great change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor in spirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And God will render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit, that all who behold may consider it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear not - (See the note at <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p>Thou worm - This word is properly applied as it is with us, to denote a worm, such as is generated in putrid substances <a href="/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>; or such as destroy plants <a href="/jonah/4-7.htm">Jonah 4:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>.

Margin, 'Few men.' There has been a great variety in the explanation of this phrase.

So the Vulgate, Qui mortui estis ex Israel. The Septuagint renders it, 'Fear not, Jacob, O diminutive Israel' (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb;  oligostos Israe&#772;l). Chaldee, 'Fear not, O tribe of the house of Jacob, ye seed of Israel.' Lowth renders it, 'Ye mortals of Israel.' The Hebrew denotes properly, as in our translation, 'men of Israel;' but there is evidently included the idea of fewness or feebleness. The parallelism requires us so to understand it; and the word men, or mortal men, may well express the idea of feebleness.<p>And thy Redeemer - On the meaning of this word, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm">Isaiah 35:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. It is applied here to the rescue from the captivity of Babylon, and is used in the general sense of deliverer. God would deliver, or rescue them as be had done in times past. He had done it so often, that this might be regarded as his appropriate appellation, that he was the redeemer of his people.<p>The Holy One of Israel - The Holy Being whom the Israelites adored, and who was their protector, and their friend (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). This appellation is often given to God (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11-12</a>). We may remark in view of these verses:<p>1. That the people of God are in themselves feeble and defenseless. They have no strength on which they can rely. They are often so encompassed with difficulties which they feel they have no strength to overcome, that they are disposed to apply to themselves the appellation of 'worm,' and by ethers they are looked on as objects of contempt, and are despised.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. worm&#8212;in a state of contempt and affliction, whom all loathe and tread on, the very expression which Messiah, on the cross, applies to Himself (Ps 22:6), so completely are the Lord and His people identified and assimilated.

It is an observation of Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, that the strength of a worm lies in its mouth, which, though tender, can strike the strongest cedar, and penetrate into it; and the latter observes, that the strength of Israel lies in their prayers, as Jacob's did, when, wrestling with the angel, and making supplication, he had power with God, and prevailed. Now, though the saints are such poor, weak, and contemptible things, yet the Lord bids them not fear any of their enemies, he would take their part, and protect them: <p>and ye men of Israel; the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "ye dead men of Israel" (s); such as were accounted as dead men, and had no more respect shown them than the dead, that are remembered no more; or were exposed to death daily, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel; or that reckoned themselves dead to sin, and did die daily to it, and lived unto righteousness: or, "ye few men of Israel", as others (t) render it; Christ's flock is a little flock, his church is a little city, and few men in it, in comparison of the men of the world: <p>I will help thee, saith, the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; which is repeated for the confirmation of it, and is the more strongly assured by these characters of a Redeemer of his people out of the hands of all their enemies, and the holy and just God, and sanctifier of them, which he here takes to himself, and makes himself known by. <p>(s)  "mortales Israeliae", Castalio.

But instead of our hearing whether the nations, with which He has entered upon the contest, have any reply to make, the address turns to Israel, upon which deliverance dawns from that very quarter, from which the others are threatened with destruction. "And thou, Israel my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, seed of Abraham my friend, thou whom I have laid hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said to thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen and not despised thee; fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not afraid, for I am thy God: I have chosen thee, I also help thee, I also hold thee with the right hand of my righteousness." The &#1493; before &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; connects together antitheses, which show themselves at once to be antitheses. Whereas the nations, which put their trust in idols that they themselves had made, were thrown into alarm, and yielded before the world-wide commotions that had originated with the eastern conqueror, Israel, the nation of Jehovah, might take comfort to itself. Every word here breathes the deepest affection. The address moves on in soft undulating lines. The repetition of the suffix &#1498;, with which &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; forms a relative of the second person, for which we have no equivalent in our language (Ges. 123, Anm. 1), gives to the address a pressing, clinging, and, as it were, loving key-note. The reason, which precedes the comforting assurance in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, recals the intimate relation in which Jehovah had placed Himself towards Israel, and Israel towards Himself. The leading thought, "servant of Jehovah," which is characteristic of chapters 40-46, and lies at the root of the whole spirit of these addresses, more especially of their Christology, we first meet with here, and that in a popular sense. It has both an objective and a subjective side. On the one hand, Israel is the servant of Jehovah by virtue of a divine act; and this act, viz., its election and call, was an act of pure grace, and was not to be traced, as the expression "I have chosen and not despised thee' indicates, to any superior excellence or merit on the part of Israel. On the contrary, Israel was so obscure that Jehovah might have despised it; nevertheless He had anticipated it in free unmerited love with this stamp of the character indelibilis of a servant of Jehovah. On the other hand, Israel was the servant of Jehovah, inasmuch as it acted out what Jehovah had made it, partly in reverential worship of this God, and partly in active obedience. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., "serving Jehovah," includes both liturgical service (also &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; absolutely, <a href="/isaiah/19-23.htm">Isaiah 19:23</a>) and the service of works. The divine act of choosing and calling is dated from Abraham. From a Palestinian point of view, Ur of Chaldaea, within the old kingdom of Nimrod, and Haran in northern Mesopotamia, seemed like the ends and corners of the earth ('a&#774;ts&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, remote places, from 'a&#770;tsal, to put aside or apart). Israel and the land of Israel were so inseparably connected, that whenever the origin of Israel was spoken of, the point of view could only be taken in Palestine. To the far distant land of the Tigris and Euphrates had Jehovah gone to fetch Abraham, "the friend of God" (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>), who is called in the East even to the present day, chalil ollah, the friend of God. This calling of Abraham was the furthest terminus a quo of the existence of Israel as the covenant nation; for the leading of Abraham was providentially appointed with reference to the rise of Israel as a nation. The latter was pre-existent in him by virtue of the counsel of God. And when Jehovah adopted Abraham as His servant, and called him "my servant" (<a href="/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a>), Israel, the nation that was coming into existence in Abraham, received both the essence and name of a "servant of Jehovah." Inasmuch then as, on looking back to its past history, it would not fail to perceive that it was so thoroughly a creation of divine power and grace, it ought not to be fearful, and look about with timidity and anxiety; for He who had presented Himself at the very beginning as its God, was still always near. The question arises, in connection with the word &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, whether it means to strengthen (<a href="/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22</a>), or to lay firm hold of, to attach firmly to one's self, to choose. We decide in favour of the latter meaning, which is established by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>, <a href="/psalms/80-18.htm">Psalm 80:18</a>. The other perfects affirm what Jehovah has ever done, and still continues to do. In the expression "by the right hand of my righteousness," the justice or righteousness is regarded pre-eminently on its brighter side, the side turned towards Israel; but it is also regarded on its fiery side, or the side turned towards the enemies of Israel. It is the righteousness which aids the oppressed congregation against its oppressors. The repeated &#1488;&#1507; heaps one synonym upon another, expressive of the divine love; for &#1493; simply connects, &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; appends, &#1488;&#1507; heaps up (cumulat). Language is too contracted to hold all the fulness of the divine love; and for this reason the latter could not find words enough to express all that it desired. </body></html>
