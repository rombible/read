There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews.

He will deliver them from the hand of all their enemies; and he will be always their God, protector, and guide. The idols of the pagan have no power; and it is folly, as well as sin, to trust in them, or to suppose that they can aid their friend.<p>It may be added, also, that it is equally vain to trust in any being for salvation but God. He only is able to protect and defend us; and it is a source of unspeakable consolation now, as it was in times past, that he is the friend of his people; and that, in times of deepest darkness and distress, he can raise up deliverers, as he did Cyrus, and will in his own way and time rescue his people from all their calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. confusion&#8212;"emptiness" [Barnes].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They are all vanity:</span> this is the conclusion of the whole dispute, and the just sentence which God passeth upon idols after a fair trial; they are vain things, and are falsely called gods. <span class="ital">Their works are nothing</span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/41-24.htm" title="Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of nothing: an abomination is he that chooses you.">Isaiah 41:24</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their molten images; </span> which he mentions, because their materials were most precious, and more cost and art was commonly bestowed upon them; for after they had been molten, they used to be carved, or polished, and adorned: but under these he synecdochichally comprehends all images whatsoever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are wind; </span> empty and unsatisfying things, which also, like the wind, do quickly pass away, and come to nothing.

"Bring hither your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forward your proofs, saith the king of Jacob. Let them bring forward, and make known to us what will happen: make known the beginning, what it is, and we will fix our heart upon it, and take knowledge of its issue; or let us hear what is to come. Make known what is coming later, and we will acknowledge that ye are gods: yea, do good, and do evil, and we will measure ourselves, and see together." In the first stage Jehovah appealed, in support of His deity, to the fact that it was He who had called the oppressor of the nations upon the arena of history. In this second stage He appeals to the fact that He only knows or can predict the future. There the challenge was addressed to the worshippers of idols, here to the idols themselves; but in both cases both of these are ranged on the one side, and Jehovah with His people upon the other. It is with purpose that Jehovah is called the "King of Jacob,"as being the tutelar God of Israel, in contrast to the tutelar deities of the heathen. The challenge to the latter to establish their deity is first of all addressed to them directly in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>, and then indirectly in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>, where Jehovah connects Himself with His people as the opposing party; but in <a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a> He returns again to a direct address. &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; are evidences (lit. robara, cf., &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>, from &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, to be strong or stringent; mishn. &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;, to contend with one another pro et contra); here it signifies proofs that they can foresee the future. Jehovah for His part has displayed this knowledge, inasmuch as, at the very time when He threatened destruction to the heathen at the hands of Cyrus, He consoled His people with the announcement of their deliverance (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8-20</a>). It is therefore the turn of the idol deities now: "Let them bring forward and announce to us the things that will come to pass." the general idea of what is in the future stands at the head. Then within this the choice is given them of proving their foreknowledge of what is afterwards to happen, by announcing either &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, or even &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;. These two ideas, therefore, are generic terms within the range of the things that are to happen. Consequently &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; cannot mean "earlier predictions," prius praedicta, as Hitzig, Knobel, and others suppose. This explanation is precluded in the present instance by the logic of the context. Both ideas lie upon the one line of the future; the one being more immediate, the other more remote, or as the expression alternating with &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; implies &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, ventura in posterum ("in later times," compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a>, "at a later period;" from the participle &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;, radical form &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, vid., Ges. 75, Anm. 5, probably to distinguish it from &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;). This is the explanation adopted by Stier and Hahn, the latter of whom has correctly expounded the word, as denoting "the events about to happen first in the immediate future, which it is not so difficult to prognosticate from signs that are discernible in the present." The choice is given them, either to foretell "things at the beginning" (hagg&#305;&#772;du&#772; in our editions is erroneously pointed with kadma instead of geresh), i.e., that which will take place first or next, "what they be" (quae et qualia sint), so that now, when the acha&#774;r&#305;&#772;th, "the latter end" (i.e., the issue of that which is held out to view), as prognosticated from the standpoint of the present, really occurs, the prophetic utterance concerning it may be verified; or "things to come," i.e., things further off, in later times (in the remote future), the prediction of which is incomparably more difficult, because without any point of contact in the present. They are to choose which they like (&#1488;&#1493; from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, like vel from velle): "ye do good, and do evil," i.e., (according to the proverbial use of the phrase; cf., <a href="/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>) only express yourselves in some way; come forward, and do either the one or the other. The meaning is, not that they are to stir themselves and predict either good or evil, but they are to show some sign of life, no matter what. "And we will measure ourselves (i.e., look one another in the face, testing and measuring), and see together," viz., what the result of the contest will be. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; like &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11</a>, with a cohortative a&#770;h, which is rarely met with in connection with verbs &#1500; &#1492;, and the tone upon the penultimate, the a&#770;h being attached without tone to the voluntative &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a> (Ewald, 228, c). For the chethib &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, the Keri has the voluntative &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;. </body></html>
