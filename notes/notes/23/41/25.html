There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May we be numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have raised up one - In the previous verses God had shown that the idols had no power of predicting future events. He stakes, so to speak, the question of his divinity on that point, and the whole controversy between him and them is to be decided by the inquiry whether they had the power of foretelling what would come to pass. He here urges his claims to divinity on this ground, that he had power to foretell future events. In illustration of this, he appeals to the fact that he had raised up, that is, in purpose, or would afterward raise up Cyrus, in accordance with his predictions, and in such a way that it would be distinctly seen that he had this power of foretelling future events. To see the force of this argument, it must be remembered that the Jews are contemplated as in Babylon, and near the close of their captivity; that God by the prophets, and especially by Isaiah, distinctly foretold the fact that he would raise up Cyrus to be their deliverer; that these predictions were uttered at least a hundred and fifty years before the time of their fulfillment; and that they would then have abundant evidence that they were accomplished. To these recorded predictions and to their fulfillment, God here appeals, and designs that in that future time when they should be in exile, his people should have evidence that He was worthy of their entire confidence, and that even the pagan should see that Yahweh was the true God, and that the idols were nothing. The personage referred to here is undoubtedly Cyrus (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>).<p>From the north - In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, he is said to have been raised up 'from the east.' Both were true. Cyrus was born in Persia, in the country called in the Scriptures 'the east,' but he early went to Media, and came from Media under the direction of his uncle, Cyaxares, when he attacked and subdued Babylon. Media was situated on the north and northeast of Babylon.<p>From the rising of the sun - The east - the land of the birth of Cyrus.<p>Shall he call upon my name - This expression means, probably, that he should acknowledge Yahweh to be the true God, and recognize him as the source of all his success. This he did in his proclamation respecting the restoration of the Jews to their own land: 'Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, Yahweh, God of heaven, hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth' <a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>. There is no decided evidence that Cyrus regarded himself as a worshipper of Yahweh, or that he was a pious man, but he was brought to make a public recognition of him as the true God, and to feel that he owed the success of his arms to him.<p>And he shall come upon princes - Upon the kings of the nations against whom he shall make war (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2-3</a>). The word rendered here 'princes' (from &#1505;&#1490;&#1503;  seggen or &#1505;&#1490;&#1503; ro n  sa&#770;ga&#770;n), denotes properly a deputy, a prefect, a governor, or one under another, and is usually applied to the governors of provinces, or the Babyionian princes, or magistrates <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-33.htm">Ezekiel 23:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>.

This does not necessarily imply that Cyrus renounced idolatry, but hearing of Isaiah's prophecy given a hundred fifty years before, so fully realized in his own acts, he recognized God as the true God, but retained his idol (so Naaman, 2Ki 5:1-27; compare 2Ki 17:33, 41; Da 3:28; 4:1-3, 34-37).<p>princes&#8212;the Babylonian satraps or governors of provinces.<p>mortar&#8212;"mire"; He shall tread them under foot as dirt (Isa 10:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have raised up; </span> you neither foreknow nor can do any thing; but I do now foretell, and will certainly effect, great revolution and change in the world, which you shall not be able to hinder. <span class="ital">One</span>; which word, though not expressed in the Hebrew, must necessarily be understood, as being oft designed in the following words by the pronoun he.

Either one people, or one person; a mighty king, as the Targum; meaning either Cyrus, who might be said to come from the north, and from the rising of the sun, or the east, as in the next clause; since he was by birth a Medo-Persian, hence called a mule; by his mother a Mede, and the country of Media lay rather to the north of Babylon; and by his father a Persian, and Persia lay to the east of it; and the forces he brought with him against it were partly Medes, and partly Persians; though some, as Jarchi observes, think two persons are meant in this and the next clause; in this Nebuchadnezzar, who came from Babylon, which lay north of Judea, to invade it; and in the other Cyrus, who came from the east, and proclaimed the name of the Lord, and liberty to the captive Jews. Kimchi and his father both interpret it of the King Messiah, as do also more ancient Jewish writers (c), of whom Cyrus was a type; but to me it seems best of all, as most agreeable to the scope and tenure of the prophecy, to understand it of Constantine, who, as reported, was born in Britain, in the northern part of the world; but, when called to the empire, was in the eastern parts of it; and so with great propriety it is expressed here, and in the following clause: <p>and from the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name; which those that apply the prophecy to Cyrus explain by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, but is much more applicable to Constantine, who was a worshipper of the true God, which invocation of his name is expressive of; and who openly professed the name of Christ, and encouraged those that did, and spread his name and fame, his Gospel and his glory, throughout the empire, east and west: <p>and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay; that is, he shall come upon them with his army, and conquer them, and tread them down, and trample upon them, as morter is trodden upon, or mire in the streets; or as the clay is trodden by the potter, who does with it as he pleases; which those who interpret it of Cyrus understand of Astyages, Croesus, Belshazzar, and others; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>, and is as true of Constantine, who subdued the emperors of Rome, trod them under his feet, as Maximius, Maxentius, Licinius, &amp;c.; moreover, the word "saganin", here used, is a word used by Jewish writers for priests, for such who were the deputies of the high priest; and it may design here the Pagan priests, and the destruction of them, and of Paganism in the Roman empire by Constantine. <p>(c) Vajikra Rabba, sect. 9. fol. 153. 1.

The clause is a relative one, and forms the obj. to “stirred up.” The expression can hardly mean less than that Cyrus shall acknowledge Jehovah as God; the meaning “make known everywhere, by his deeds” (Dillmann) is not to be defended. It is true that in ch. <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm" title="For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.">Isaiah 45:4</a> f. it is said that Cyrus <span class="ital">had not known</span> Jehovah; but it is also said (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/41-3.htm" title="He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.">Isaiah 41:3</a></span>) that the effect of his remarkable successes will be “that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah <span class="ital">that calleth thee by thy name</span>, the God of Israel.” There is therefore no difficulty in the idea that Cyrus, who was at first the unconscious instrument of Jehovah’s purpose, shall at length recognise that Jehovah was the true author of his success.

Both as a Persian, and as King of Elam, Cyrus might be considered to come from the east. In fact, however, when he attacked Babylon, he fell upon it mainly from the north. After his conquest of Astyages (Istivegu), he made Ecbatana his capital (Herod., 1:153); and it was from this comparatively northern city that he directed his attack upon Nabonidus. His march lay by way of Arbela ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 159) and Sippara  (ibid., p. 165), through the district called Akkad to the Chaldean capital. Herodotus agrees with the monuments in bringing him to Babylon from the north. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he call upon my Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">shall he. proclaim my</span> Name.

Recent discoveries have raised the suspicion that Cyrus was a eyncretist, who was willing to accept the chief god of any nation as identical with his own Ormuzd. But it is to be borne in 'mind that the document which has produced this impression is one issued by the priestly authorities of Babylon in their own language, and may have been quite unknown to the Persian court. Cyrus may have been a better Zoroastrian than he is represented by the priests of Merodach. The Zoroastrian religion was, as Delitzsch observes, "nearest to the Jewish religion of all the systems of heathenism" (see . Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 93-117; and comp. Pusey, 'Lectures on Daniel,' pp. 530-550). <span class="cmt_word">He shall come upon princes as upon mortar</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall tread them underfoot, mortar being commonly mixed with the feet, as was also clay for bricks and pottery (Herod., 2:36).

He was studiously mild in his treatment of royal captives, but naturally deprived them of all power. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the present time, indeed, the state of His people was a helpless one, but its cry for help was not in vain.

I give in the desert cedars, acacias, and myrtles, and oleasters; I set in the steppe cypresses, plane-trees, and sherbin-trees together, that they may see, and know, and lay to heart and understand all together, that the hand of Jehovah hath accomplished this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it." Kimchi, Hitzig, and others refer these promises to the returning exiles; but there is also a description, without any restriction to the return home, of the miraculous change which would take place in the now comfortless and helpless condition of the exiles. The shepha&#770;y&#305;&#772;m, i.e., bare, woodless hills rising up from the plain, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>, the beqa&#770;&#8219;o&#772;th, or deep valleys, by the sides of which there rise precipitous mountains, and the 'erets tsiyya&#770;h, the land of burning heat or drought (cf., <a href="/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>), depict the homeless condition of Israel, as it wandered over bald heights and through waterless plains about a land with parched and gaping soil. For the characteristics of the object, which is placed before &#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501;, we may therefore compare such passages as <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is either a pausal form for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, and therefore the niphal of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; (to set, become shallow, dry up), or a pausal form for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492;, and therefore the kal of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; with dagesh affectuosum, like &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a> (Olshausen, 83, b). The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; in <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a> may just as well be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; (Ges. 67, Anm. 11) as from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, whereas &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; may certainly be taken as the niphal of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; after the form &#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; (Ges. 67, Anm. 5), though it would be safer to refer it to a kal &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, which seems to be also favoured by &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a> as a transposition of &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;. The root &#1504;&#1513;, of which &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; would be a further expansion, really exhibits the meaning to dry up or thirst, in the Arabic nassa; whereas the verbs &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1504;&#1505;&#1505; (<a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a>), &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, Syr. nas', nos', Arab. na&#770;sa, nasnasa, with the primary meaning to slacken, lose their hold, and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1505;&#1506;, to deceive, derange, and advance, form separate families. Just when they are thus on the point of pining away, they receive an answer to their prayer: their God opens streams, i.e., causes streams to break forth on the hills of the field, and springs in the midst of the valleys. The desert is transformed into a lake, and the steppe of burning sand into fountains of water. What was predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a> is echoed again here - a figurative representation of the manifold fulness of refreshing, consolation, and marvellous help which was to burst all at once upon those who were apparently forsaken of God. What is depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>, is the effect of these. It is not merely a scanty vegetation that springs up, but a corresponding manifold fulness of stately, fragrant, and shady trees; so that the steppe, where neither foot nor eye could find a resting-place, is changed, as by a stroke of magic, into a large, dense, well-watered forest, and shines with sevenfold glory - an image of the many-sided manifestations of divine grace which are experienced by those who are comforted now. Isaiah is especially fond of such figures as these (vid., <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a>). There are seven (4 + 3) trees named; seven indicating the divine character of this manifold development (Psychol. p. 188). 'Erez is the generic name for the cedar; shitta&#770;h, the acacia, the Egyptian spina (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;), Copt. shont; hadas, the myrtle, &#8219;e&#772;ts shemen, the wild olive, as distinguished from zayith (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, opposed to &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>); bero&#772;sh, the cypress, at any rate more especially this; tidha&#770;r we have rendered the "plane-tree," after Saad.; and te'asshu&#772;r the "sherbin" (a kind of cedar), after Saad. and Syr. The crowded synonyms indicating sensual and spiritual perception in <a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a> (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, sc. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>) are meant to express as strongly as possible the irresistible character of the impression. They will be quite unable to regard all this as accidental or self-produced, or as anything but the production of the power and grace of their God. </body></html>
