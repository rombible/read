Every shape of the physical contour of the country, bare hills, arid steppes, and the like, is to be transformed into a new beauty by water in the form adapted to each: streamlets, rivers, lakes, and springs. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm" title="And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.">Isaiah 35:7</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:10-20 God speaks with tenderness; Fear thou not, for I am with thee: not only within call, but present with thee. Art thou weak? I will strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee in the time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with that right hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards and punishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seek their ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God's time. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised and trampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God's word is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear little in his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. The Lord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will make him fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment in the triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers of Christ, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supply all their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want, and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in the world, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constant supply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace, rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, Joh 7:38,39. When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be a great change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor in spirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And God will render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit, that all who behold may consider it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will open rivers - That is, I will cause rivers to flow (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>). The allusion here is doubtless to the miraculous supply of water in the desert when the Israelites had come out of Egypt. God then supplied their needs; and in a similar manner he would always meet his people, and would supply their needs as if rivers of pure water were made to flow from dry and barren hills.<p>In high places - The word used here denotes properly barrenness or nakedness <a href="/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>; and then a hill that is bare, or destitute of trees. It is applied usually to hills in a desert <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>. Such hills, without trees, and in a dry and lonely desert, were of course usually without water. The idea is, that God would refresh them as if rivers were made to flow from such hills; and it may not improperly be regarded as a promise that God would meet and bless his people in situations, and from sources where they least expected refreshment and comfort.<p>And fountains in the midst of the valleys - (See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, note).<p>I will make the wilderness - (See the note at <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

"Behold, all they that were incensed against thee must be ashamed and confounded; the men of thy conflict become as nothing, and perish. Thou wilt seek them, and not find them, the men of thy feuds; the men of thy warfare become as nothing, and nonentity. For I, Jehovah thy God, lay hold of thy right hand, He who saith to thee, Fear not; I will help thee." The comprehensive expression omnes inflammati in te (niphal, as in <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>) stands at the head; and then, in order that every kind may be included, the enemies are called by a different name every time. The three substantives bear much the same relation to one another as lis, rixa, bellum (milcha&#770;ma&#770;h, lit., throng  equals  war-tumult, like the epic &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), hence adversarii, inimici, hostes. The suffixes have the force of objective genitives. We have founded our translation upon the reading &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;. The three names of the enemies are placed emphatically at the close of the sentences, and these are long drawn out, whilst the indignation gives vent to itself; whereas in <a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a> there follows nothing but short sentences, in which the persecuted church is encouraged and affectionately embraced. Two clauses, which are made to rhyme with e&#772;m, announce the utter destruction of their foes; then the inflective rhyme ekha is repeated five times; and the sixth time it passes over into &#305;&#772;kha. </body></html>
