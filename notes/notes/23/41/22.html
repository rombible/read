Can the false gods predict them as the pledge and earnest of predictions that go farther? Can they see a single year before them? We note that the challenge exactly corresponds to Isaiah’s own method of giving “signs” that his words are not idly spoken (<a href="/context/isaiah/7-10.htm" title="Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,">Isaiah 7:10-14</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/38-7.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>).

The things “for to come” lie, as it were, in the middle future, the “hereafter” of <a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm" title="Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.">Isaiah 41:23</a>, in the more remote.

There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May we be numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them bring them forth - Let the idols, or the worshippers of idols, bring forth the evidences of their divine nature and power. Or more probably it means, 'let them draw near or approach.'<p>And show us what shall happen - None but the true God can discern the future, and predict what is to occur. To be able to do this, is therefore a proof of divinity to which God often appeals as a demonstration of his own divine character (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). This idea, that none but the true God can know all things, and can with certainty foretell future events, is one that was admitted even by the pagan (see Xen. Cyr. i. 'The immortal gods know all things, both the past, the present, and those things which shall proceed from each thing. It was on this belief also that the worshippers of idols endeavored to sustain the credit of their idol-gods; and accordingly, nearly all the reputation which the oracle at Delphi, and other shrines, obtained, arose from the remarkable sagacity which was evinced in predicting future events, or the skillful ambiguity in which they so couched their responses as to be able to preserve their influence whatever might be the result.<p>Let them show the former things what they be - The idea in this passage seems to be, 'Let them foretell the entire series of events; let them predict in their order, the things which shall first occur, as well as those which shall finally happen. Let them not select merely an isolated and unconnected event in futurity, but let them declare those which shall have a mutual relation and dependency, and whose causes are now hid.' The argument in the passage is, that it required a far more profound knowledge to predict the serges of events as they should actually occur; to foretell their order of occur rence, than it did to foretell one single isolated occurrence. The latter, the false prophets of the pagan often undertook to do; and undoubtedly they often evinced great sagacity in it. But they never undertook to detail minutely a series of occurrences, and to state the order in which they would happen. In the Scriptures, it is the common way to foretell the order of events, or a series of transactions pertaining often to many individuals or nations, and stretching far into futurity. And it is perfectly manifest that none could do this but God (compare <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>Or declare us things for to come - Declare any event that is to occur; anything in the future. If they cannot predict the order of things, or a series of events, let them clearly foretell any single event in futurity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. what shall happen&#8212;"Let them bring near and declare future contingencies" [Horsley].<p>former things &#8230; the latter end of them&#8212;show what former predictions the idols have given, that we may compare the event ("latter end") with them; or give new prophecies ("declare things to come") (Isa 42:9), [Maurer]. Barnes explains it more reconditely, "Let them foretell the entire series of events, showing, in their order, the things which shall first occur, as well as those which shall finally happen"; the false prophets tried to predict isolated events, having no mutual dependency; not a long series of events mutually and orderly connected, and stretching far into futurity. They did not even try to do this. None but God can do it (Isa 46:10; 44:7, 8). "Or &#8230; things to come" will, in this view, mean, Let them, if they cannot predict the series, even predict plainly any detached events.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let them; </span> either the idols; or, which is all one, the idolaters in the name and by the help of their idols. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What shall happen; </span> all future events; which he divides into two sorts in the following clause, the former and the latter, as we shall see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let them show the former things; </span> which is not to be understood of such things as are past, for such things might easily be known by men from history, much more by the devils who possessed and acted in their idols; but of such things as should shortly come to pass, which may be better discerned than those things which are yet at a great distance. So he propounds the easiest part first. Let us try whether they can foretell those things which are even at the door, and if so we will try them further.

Not their reasons, as before, but their gods; let them cause them to come nigh, let them appear in court, and speak for themselves, when their worshippers have said all they can in defence of their deity: <p>and show us what shall happen: what shall come to pass hereafter; and by that prove their divinity; for none but God can foretell things to come with certainty; for everything else but what comes from God, by his prophets, is all conjecture, ambiguous, uncertain, mere juggle, trick, and deception, as were the oracles of the Heathens; but what is clearly and plainly foretold, and agreeably to the prediction comes to pass, is a proof of deity, and as such is here challenged. The "us" here, and the "we" in the following clauses, either design God, and the Christians, the true worshippers of him; or rather the three divine Persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Spirit, the one true God, in opposition to the gods of the Heathens. The Targum renders it, <p>"what shall happen to us:'' <p>let them show the former things what they be: either what were before the creation of the world, as Jarchi; what were purposed, decreed, and determined so early to be done; or let them write, or inspire their prophets to write, a history of the creation, and of the transactions of former times, as Moses did, under the inspiration of God; or let them show what things before predicted by them have come to pass, agreeably to their predictions; or rather "the first things, which may be, show" (y); what will first or presently come to pass, that show unto us if you can: <p>that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or, "and we will set our hearts upon them" (z); weigh them well in our minds, and diligently and attentively consider them, how and in what manner it is foretold they shall come to pass, and take notice and observe the issue of them, and whether the event answers to the prediction: or "declare us things for to come"; which are at a great distance; tell us not only what shall be done in the present age, but onward to the end of the world. <p>(y)    "priora quid ipsa, nuntiate", Montanus; "piora quaenam sint indicate", Piscator.

The expression (<span class="ital">hâ-rî’shônôth</span>) occurs with great frequency in the first part of this prophecy. Sometimes the stress lies on the event, sometimes on the prediction; but in reality the phrase includes both ideas—“past events as predicted.” So here the challenge is to produce past predictions which have been already verified by the event.

God claims that the power of predicting the future is his own inalienable prerogative. He defies the idol-gods and their votaries to give any clear prediction of future events. No doubt the claim to possess the power was made very generally among the idolatrous nations, who almost universally practised divination, and in many case<span class="accented">s</span> possessed oracles. But it was a false claim, based upon fraud and cunning, which deceived men as often as dependence was placed upon it (Herod., 1:53, 91) and landed them in misfortune. <span class="cmt_word">The former things...  things for to come.</span> Some commentators regard "the former things" as things actually past - "the beginnings of history, for instance, which to the heathen nations were wrapped in darkness" (Kay); but it seems better, on the whole, to understand (with Vitringa, Stier, Hahn, Cheyne, and Delitzsch) by "the former things" those in the immediate future, by "things for to come" those about to happen in remoter times. The former are, of course, much the easier to predict, since they fall to some extent within the domain of human foresight; the latter are more difficult; but the idol-gods are challenged to produce either the one or the other. <span class="cmt_word">What they be</span>. A definite and clear statement is required to preclude such vague and ambiguous utterances as the heathen oracles delighted to put forth. <span class="cmt_word">That we may consider them</span> (or, <span class="accented">lay them to heart</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and know the latter end of them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> compare them with the event, when the time comes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The consolatory words, "Fear not," are now repeated, for the purpose of once more adding the promise that Israel will not succumb to its foes, but will acquire power over its enemies. "Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and handful Israel: I will help thee, saith Jehovah; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. Behold, I have made thee a threshing roller, a sharp new one, with double edges: thou wilt thresh mountains, and pound them; and hills thou wilt make like chaff. Thou wilt winnow them, and wind carries them away, and tempest scatters them: and thou wilt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel." Israel, which is now helplessly oppressed, is called "worm of Jacob" (gen. appos.) in compassion, i.e., Jacob that is like a worm, probably with some allusion to <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; for the image of the Messiah enriches itself in these discourses, inasmuch as Israel itself is looked upon in a Messianic light, so that the second David does not stand by the side of Israel, but appears as Israel's heart, or true and inmost essence. The people are then addressed as the "people of Israel," with some allusion to the phrase &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (i.e., few men, easily numbered) in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a> (lxx &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c3; &#787;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;; Luther, Ir armer hauffe Israel, ye poor crowd of Israel). They no longer formed the compact mass of a nation; the band of the commonwealth was broken: they were melted down into a few individuals, scattered about hither and thither. But it would not continue so. "I help thee" (perfect of certainty) is Jehovah's solemn declaration; and the Redeemer (redemtor, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48-49</a>) of His now enslaved people is the Holy One of Israel, with His love, which perpetually triumphs over wrath. Not only will He set it free, but He will also endow it with might over its oppressors; samt&#305;&#772;kh is a perfect of assurance (Ges. 126, 4); mo&#772;rag (roller) signifies a threshing-sledge (Arab. naureg, no&#772;reg), which has here the term &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (<a href="/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>) as a secondary name along with &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, and is described as furnished on the under part of the two arms of the sledge not only with sharp knives, but with two-edged knives (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; a reduplication, like &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>, whereas &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is a double plural). Just like such a threshing machine would Israel thresh and grind to powder from that time forth both mountains and hills. This is evidently a figurative expression for proud and mighty foes, just as wind and tempest denote the irresistible force of Jehovah's aid. The might of the enemy would be broken down to the very last remnant, whereas Israel would be able to rejoice and glory in its God. </body></html>
