The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth - From Chaldea - regarded by the Jews as the remote part of the earth. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>, it is said of the Medes that they came 'from a far country, from the end of heaven' (see the note on that place). Abraham was called from Ur of the Chaldees - a city still remaining on the east of the river Euphrates. It is probably the same place as the Persian fortress Ur, between Nesibis and the Tigris. It was visited by Mr. Wolfe, Mr. Buckingham, and by others.<p>And called thee from the chief men thereof - Or rather, from the extremities of the earth. The word &#1488;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;  'a&#770;tsiyl means properly "a side"; and when applied to the earth, means the sides ends, or extremities of it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>, it is rendered 'nobles,' from an Arabic word signifying to he deep-rooted, and hence, those who are sprung from an ancient stock (Gesenius). In this place it is evidently used in the same sense as the word (&#1488;&#1510;&#1500;  'e&#772;tsel) meaning "side," in the sense of extremity, or end. The parallelism requires us to give this interpretation to the word. So Jerome renders it, longinquis ejus (sc. terroe). The Septuagint renders it, &#x395;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  Ek to&#772;n sko&#772;pio&#772;n - 'From the speculations of the earth' (Thompson), or rather perhaps meaning from the extremity of vision; from the countries lying in the distant horizon; or from the elevated places which offered an extensive range of vision. The Chaldee renders it, 'From the kingdoms I have selected thee.' Symmachus renders it, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Apo to&#772;n angko&#772;no&#772;n aute&#772;s - from its angles, its corners, its extremities. Some have supposed that this refers to the deliverance from Egypt, but the more probable interpretation is that which refers it to the call of Abraham from Chaldea; and the idea is, that as God had called him from that distant land, and had made him his friend, he would preserve and guard his posterity. Perhaps it may be implied that he would be favorable to them in that same country from where he had called their illustrious progenitor, and would in like manner conduct them to the land of promise, that is, to their own land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

But the parallel clause "ends of the earth" favors Gesenius, who translates, "the extremities of the earth"; so Jerome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth; </span> thou, Israel, whom I took to myself, and brought hither in the loins of thy father Abraham from a remote country, to wit, Chaldea; or, whom I brought back out of Babylon into thine own land, which though yet to come, he may speak of as of a thing past, as the prophets use to do, as was noted before. Jut the former interpretation seems to agree better with the foregoing verse. <span class="bld">From the chief men thereof; </span> from the midst of many great and noble persons, among whom he lived in Chaldea. So this notes God’s singular mercy to Abraham, and consequently to the Israelites descended from him, that he passed by many of Abraham’s betters, and called him into fellowship with himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away; </span> I have chosen thee not for a small moment, but for ever, by making an everlasting covenant with thee and thy seed through all generations.

Or, <span class="ital">and did not refuse thee</span>, as this word is elsewhere used. So the same thing is repeated in other words, not without some emphasis; for he intimates that he chose them when he had just cause of refusing them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth,....

It is a little difficult to suppose that Egypt could be described as the “ends of the earth” by a Jew; for although the writer may have lived in Babylonia, he could hardly divest himself of the historic consciousness of his nation, that Egypt was the neighbour of Israel. It is more probable, therefore, that he is thinking of Mesopotamia, and of the choice of Israel as effected in the call of Abraham.
