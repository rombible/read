It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth mourneth - The word 'earth' here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>, means the land of Judea, or that and so much of the adjacent countries as would be subject to the desolation described.

"And it will come to pass in that day, that Tzor will be forgotten seventy years, equal to the days of one king; after the end of the seventy years, Tzor will go, according to the song of the harlot. Take the guitar, sweep through the city, O forgotten harlot! Play bravely, sing zealously, that thou mayest be remembered!" The "days of a king" are a fixed and unchangeable period, for which everything is determined by the one sovereign will (as is the case more especially in the East), and is therefore stereotyped. The seventy years are compared to the days of such a king. Seventy is well fitted to be the number used to denote a uniform period of this kind, being equal to 10 x 7, i.e., a compact series of heptads of years (shabbathoth). But the number is also historical, prophecy being the power by which the history of the future was "periodized" beforehand in this significant manner. They coincide with the seventy years of Jeremiah (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), that is to say, with the duration of the Chaldean rule. During this period Tyre continued with its world-wide commerce in a state of involuntary repose. "Tyre will be forgotten:" v'nishcachath is not a participle (Bttcher), but the perf. cons. which is required here, and stands for &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; with an original &#1514; fem. (cf., <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a>). After the seventy years (that is to say, along with the commencement of the Persian rule) the harlot is welcomed again. She is like a bayadere or troubadour going through the streets with song and guitar, and bringing her charms into notice again. The prophecy here falls into the tone of a popular song, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>. It will be with Tyre as with such a musician and dancer as the one described in the popular song. </body></html>
