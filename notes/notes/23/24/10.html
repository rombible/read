It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The city of confusion - That Jerusalem is here intended there can be no doubt. The name 'city of confusion.' is probably given to it by anticipation of what it would be; that is, as it appeared in prophetic vision to Isaiah (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). He gave to it a name that would describe its state when these calamities should have come upon it. The word rendered 'confusion' (&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;  to&#770;hu&#770;) does not denote disorder or anarchy, but is a word expressive of emptiness, vanity, destitution of form, waste. It occurs <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> : 'And the earth was without form.' In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>, it is rendered 'the empty place;' in <a href="/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18-19</a>, 'in vain;' and usually 'emptiness,' 'vanity', 'confusion' (see <a href="/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>).

Even the “city,” usually the scene of busy and joyous life, shares in the universal sadness. It is difficult to say whether a particular city is meant, or whether the word is used collectively for cities in general. The fulness of the picture gives the impression that the writer has a particular city before his mind, although it stands as a type of many others throughout the world. If this be so, it is most natural to refer the description to Jerusalem, where the prophecy seems to have been written.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city of confusion is broken down</span>.

"Smitten down, withered up is the earth; pined away, wasted away is the world; pined away have they, the foremost of the people of the earth. And the earth has become wicked among its inhabitants; for they transgressed revelations, set at nought the ordinance, broke the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they who dwelt in it make expiation: therefore are the inhabitants of the earth withered up, and there are very few mortals left. New wine mourneth, vine is parched, all the merry-hearted groan. The joyous playing of tabrets is silent; the noise of them that rejoice hath ceased; the joyous playing of the guitar is silent. They drink no wine with a song; meth tastes bitter to them that drink it." "The world" (te&#772;be&#772;l) is used here in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> (always in the form of a proper name, and without the article), as a parallel to "the earth" (ha&#770;'a&#770;retz), with which it alternates throughout this cycle of prophecies. It is used poetically to signify the globe, and that without limitation (even in <a href="/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>); and therefore "the earth" is also to be understood here in its most comprehensive sense (in a different sense, therefore, from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>, which contains the same play upon sounds). The earth is sunk in mourning, and has become like a faded plant, withered up with heat; the high ones of the people of the earth (mero&#772;m; abstr. pro concr., like ca&#770;bo&#772;d in <a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>) are included (&#1506;&#1501; is used, as in <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>, to signify humanity, i.e., man generally). &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (for the form, see Comm. on Job, at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16-19</a>) stands in half pause, which throws the subjective notion that follows into greater prominence. It is the punishment of the inhabitants of the earth, which the earth has to share, because it has shared in the wickedness of those who live upon it: cha&#770;naph (not related to ta&#770;naph) signifies to be degenerate, to have decided for what is evil (<a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>), to be wicked; and in this intransitive sense it is applied to the land, which is said to be affected with the guilt of wicked, reckless conduct, more especially of blood-guiltiness (<a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>; compare the transitive use in <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>). The wicked conduct of men, which has caused the earth also to become chane&#772;pha&#770;h, is described in three short, rapid, involuntarily excited sentences (compare <a href="/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>; also <a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>; out of the book of Isaiah, however, we only meet with this in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>, and possibly <a href="/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11</a>). Understanding "the earth" as we do in a general sense, "the law" cannot signify merely the positive law of Israel. The Gentile world had also a tora&#770;h or divine teaching within, which contained an abundance of divine directions (to&#772;ro&#772;th). They also had a law written in their hearts; and it was with the whole human race that God concluded a covenant in the person of Noah, at a time when the nations had none of them come into existence at all. This is the explanation given by even Jewish commentators; nevertheless, we must not forget that Israel was included among the transgressors, and the choice of expression was determined by this. With the expression "therefore" the prophecy moves on from sin to punishment, just as in <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; is the curse of God denounced against the transgressors of His law (<a href="/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>, which is founded upon this, and from which &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; has been introduced into this passage in some codices and editions). The curse of God devours, for it is fire, and that from within outwards (see <a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-18.htm">Isaiah 9:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11-14</a>): cha&#770;ru&#772; (milel, since pashta is an acc. postpos.),<p>(Note: In correct texts cha&#770;r has two pashtas, the former indicating the place of the tone.)<p>from cha&#770;rar, they are burnt up, exusti. With regard to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, it is hardly necessary to observe that it cannot be traced back to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;; and that of the two meanings, culpam contrahere and culpam sustinere, it has the latter meaning here. We must not overlook the genuine mark of Isaiah here in the description of the vanishing away of men down to a small remnant: &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;) is the standing word used to denote this; &#1502;&#1494;&#1506;&#1512; (used with regard to number both here and in <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; and with regard to time in <a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a> and <a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>) is exclusively Isaiah's; and &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/24-7.htm">Isaiah 24:7</a> we are reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1.htm">Joel 1</a> (on the short sentences, see <a href="/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8-10</a>); in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-8.htm">Isaiah 24:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/24-9.htm">Isaiah 24:9</a> any one acquainted with Isaiah's style will recall to mind not only <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>, but a multitude of other parallels. We content ourselves with pointing to &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494; (which belongs exclusively to Isaiah, and is taken from <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a> in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>, and from <a href="/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a> in <a href="/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11</a>); and for basshir (with joyous song) to <a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a> (with the beating of drums and playing of guitars), together with <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>.

All the sources of joy and gladness are destroyed; and even if there is much still left of that which ought to give enjoyment, the taste of the men themselves turns it into bitterness. </body></html>
