Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth is utterly broken down - The effect as it were of an earthquake where everything is thrown into commotion and ruin.<p>The earth is moved exceedingly - Everything in this verse is intense and emphatic. The verbs are in the strongest form of emphasis: 'By breaking, the land is broken;' 'by scattering, the land is scattered;' 'by commotion, the land is moved.' The repetition also of the expression in the same sense three times, is a strong form of emphasis; and the whole passage is designed to denote the utter desolation and ruin that had come upon the land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. earth&#8212;the land: image from an earthquake.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is repeated again, partly to show the dreadfulness and certainty of these judgments, and partly to awaken and affect the stupid Israelites, who greatly needed it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The earth is utterly broken down,....

The material globe itself breaks up and perishes. It is "the crack of doom." Mr. Cheyne remarks that "the language imitates the cracking and bursting with which the present world shall pass away." The Authorized Version is very feeble compared to the original. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The world with its pleasure is judged; the world's city is also judged, in which both the world's power and the world's pleasure were concentrated. "The city of tohu is broken to pieces; every house is shut up, so that no man can come in. There is lamentation for wine in the fields; all rejoicing has set; the delight of the earth is banished. What is left of the city is wilderness, and the gate was shattered to ruins. For so will it be within the earth, in the midst of the nations; as at the olive-beating, as at the gleaning, when the vintage is over." The city of tohu (kiryath to&#772;hu): this cannot be taken collectively, as Rosenmller, Arndt, and Drechsler suppose, on account of the annexation of kiryath to tohu, which is turned into a kind of proper name; for can we understand it as referring to Jerusalem, as the majority of commentators have done, including even Schegg and Stier (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>), after we have taken "the earth" (ha&#770;'a&#770;retz) in the sense of kosmos (the world). It is rather the central city of the world as estranged from God; and it is here designated according to its end, which end will be tohu, as its nature was tohu. Its true nature was the breaking up of the harmony of all divine order; and so its end will be the breaking up of its own standing, and a hurling back, as it were, into the chaos of its primeval beginning. With a very similar significance Rome is called turbida Roma in Persius (i. 5). The whole is thoroughly Isaiah's, even to the finest points: tohu is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>; and for the expression &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; (so that you cannot enter; namely, on account of the ruins which block up the doorway) compare <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>, also <a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>. The cry or lamentation for the wine out in the fields (<a href="/isaiah/24-11.htm">Isaiah 24:11</a>; cf., <a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>) is the mourning on account of the destruction of the vineyards; the vine, which is one of Isaiah's most favourite symbols, represents in this instance also all the natural sources of joy. In the term &#8219;a&#770;rba&#770;h (rejoicing) the relation between joy and light is presupposed; the sun of joy is set (compare <a href="/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>). What remains of the city &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is partitive, just as &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>) is shamma&#770;h (desolation), to which the whole city has been brought (compare <a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>). The strong gates, which once swarmed with men, are shattered to ruins (yuccath, like <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>, for yu&#772;cath, Ges. 67, Anm. 8; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;, a predicating noun of sequence, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>, "into desolated heaps;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>, etc., and other passages). In the whole circuit of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>; ha&#770;'a&#770;retz is "the earth" here as in <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-24.htm">Isaiah 19:24</a>), and in the midst of what was once a crowd of nations (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6-7</a>), there is only a small remnant of men left. This is the leading thought, which runs through the book of Isaiah from beginning to end, and is figuratively depicted here in a miniature of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4-6</a>. The state of things produced by the catastrophe is compared to the olive-beating, which fetches down what fruit was left at the general picking, and to the gleaning of the grapes after the vintage has been fully gathered in (ca&#770;la&#770;h is used here as in <a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>, etc., viz., "to be over," whereas in <a href="/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a> it means to be hopelessly lost, as in <a href="/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>). There are no more men in the whole of the wide world than there are of olives and grapes after the principal gathering has taken place. The persons saved belong chiefly, though not exclusively, to Israel (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>). The place where they assemble is the land of promise. </body></html>
