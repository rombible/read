It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>drink wine with a song - That is, accompanied with a song, as the usual mode was in their feasts.<p>Strong drink - On the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;  she&#770;ka&#772;r see the note at <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>.<p>Shall be bitter ... - They shall cease to find pleasure in it in consequence of the general calamitics that have come upon the nation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. with a song&#8212;the usual accompaniment of feasts.<p>strong drink&#8212;(See on [733]Isa 5:11).

Even in their cups they will be silent. <span class="cmt_word">Strong drink shall be bitter</span>. By "strong drink" (<span class="accented">shekar</span>) seems to be meant any intoxicating liquor whatever, including wine. Many such liquors were drunk in Palestine (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 458, 459). All were more or less pleasant to the taste; but they would taste bitter to those who were warped and soured by the calamities of the time, which would prevent all enjoyment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is thoroughly characteristic of Isaiah, that the commencement of this prophecy, like <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>, places us at once in the very midst of the catastrophe, and condenses the contents of the subsequent picture of judgment into a few rapid, vigorous, vivid, and comprehensive clauses (like <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>). "Behold, Jehovah emptieth the earth, and layeth it waste, and marreth its form, and scattereth its inhabitants. And it happeneth, as to the people, so to the priest; as to the servant, so to his master; as to the maid, so to her mistress; as to the buyer, so to the seller; as to the lender, so to the borrower; as to the creditor, so to the debtor. Emptying the earth is emptied, and plundering is plundered: for Jehovah hat spoken this word." The question, whether the prophet is speaking of a past of future judgment, which is one of importance to the interpretation of the whole, is answered by the fact that with Isaiah "hinne&#772;h" (behold) always refers to something future (<a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, etc.). And it is only in his case, that we do meet with prophecies commencing so immediately with hinne&#772;h. Those in Jeremiah which approach this the most nearly (viz., <a href="/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>) do indeed commence with hinne&#772;h, but not without being preceded by an introductory formula. The opening "behold" corresponds to the confirmatory "for Jehovah hath spoken," which is always employed by Isaiah at the close of statements with regard to the future and occurs chiefly,<p>(Note: Vid., <a href="/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-25.htm">Isaiah 22:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a>; also compare <a href="/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-13.htm">Isaiah 16:13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>.)<p>though not exclusively,<p>(Note: Vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>.)<p>in the book of Isaiah, whom we may recognise in the detailed description in <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2-3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18-23</a>, as compared with <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; also with the description of judgment in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2-4</a>, which closes in a similar manner). Thus at the very outset we meet with Isaiah's peculiarities; and Caspari is right in saying that no prophecy could possibly commence with more of the characteristics of Isaiah than the prophecy before us. The play upon words commences at the very outset. Ba&#770;kak and ba&#770;lak (compare the Arabic ballu&#772;ka, a blank, naked desert) have the same ring, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-3.htm">Isaiah 24:3</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a>. The niphal futures are intentionally written like verbs Pe-Va&#770;v (tibbo&#772;k and tibbo&#772;z, instead of tibbak and tibbaz), for the purpose of making them rhyme with the infinitive absolutes (cf., <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). So, again, caggebirta&#770;h is so written instead of cigbirta&#770;h, to produce a greater resemblance to the opening syllable of the other words. The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is interchanged with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;) (as in <a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), or, according to Kimchi's way of writing it, with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;) (written with tzere), just as in other passages we meet with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; along with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, and, judging from Arab. ns', to postpone or credit, the former is the primary form. No&#772;sheh is the creditor, and &#1489;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not the person who has borrowed of him, but, as &#1504;&#1513;&#1492; invariably signifies to credit (hiphil, to give credit), the person whom he credits (with &#1489; obj., like &#1489;&#1468; &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474; in <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>), not "the person through whom he is &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;)" (Hitzig on <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>). Hence, "lender and borrower, creditor and debtor" (or taker of credit). It is a judgment which embraces all, without distinction of rank and condition; and it is a universal one, not merely throughout the whole of the land of Israel (as even Drechsler renders &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;), but in all the earth; for as Arndt correctly observes, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies "the earth" in this passage, including, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, the ethical New Testament idea of "the world" (kosmos). </body></html>
