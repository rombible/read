Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the noise of the fear - A cry or shout was made in hunting, designed to arouse the game, and drive it to the pitfall.

It was possible that some of the more strong and active of the wild beasts driven into the pitfall would spring out, and attempt to escape, yet they might be secured by snares or gins purposely contrived for such an occurrence. So the prophet says, that though a few might escape the calamities that would at first threaten to overthrow them, yet they would have no security. They would immediately fall into others, and be destroyed.<p>For the windows on high are open - This is evidently taken from the account of the deluge in <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a> : 'In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows (or flood-gates, Margin) of heaven were opened.' The word 'windows' here (&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;  'a&#774;rubo&#770;th) is the same which occurs in Genesis, and properly denotes a grate, a lattice, a window, and then any opening, as a sluice or floodgate, and is applied to a tempest or a deluge, because when the rain descends, it seems like opening sluices or floodgates in the sky. The sense here is, that calamities had come upon the nation resembling the universal deluge.<p>And the foundations of the earth do shake - An image derived from an earthquake - a figure also denoting far-spreading calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. noise of &#8230; fear&#8212;the shout designed to rouse the game and drive it into the pitfall.<p>windows &#8230; open&#8212;taken from the account of the deluge (Ge 7:11); the flood-gates.

"The city of tohu is broken to pieces; every house is shut up, so that no man can come in. There is lamentation for wine in the fields; all rejoicing has set; the delight of the earth is banished. What is left of the city is wilderness, and the gate was shattered to ruins. For so will it be within the earth, in the midst of the nations; as at the olive-beating, as at the gleaning, when the vintage is over." The city of tohu (kiryath to&#772;hu): this cannot be taken collectively, as Rosenmller, Arndt, and Drechsler suppose, on account of the annexation of kiryath to tohu, which is turned into a kind of proper name; for can we understand it as referring to Jerusalem, as the majority of commentators have done, including even Schegg and Stier (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>), after we have taken "the earth" (ha&#770;'a&#770;retz) in the sense of kosmos (the world). It is rather the central city of the world as estranged from God; and it is here designated according to its end, which end will be tohu, as its nature was tohu. Its true nature was the breaking up of the harmony of all divine order; and so its end will be the breaking up of its own standing, and a hurling back, as it were, into the chaos of its primeval beginning. With a very similar significance Rome is called turbida Roma in Persius (i. 5). The whole is thoroughly Isaiah's, even to the finest points: tohu is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>; and for the expression &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; (so that you cannot enter; namely, on account of the ruins which block up the doorway) compare <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>, also <a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>. The cry or lamentation for the wine out in the fields (<a href="/isaiah/24-11.htm">Isaiah 24:11</a>; cf., <a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>) is the mourning on account of the destruction of the vineyards; the vine, which is one of Isaiah's most favourite symbols, represents in this instance also all the natural sources of joy. In the term &#8219;a&#770;rba&#770;h (rejoicing) the relation between joy and light is presupposed; the sun of joy is set (compare <a href="/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>). What remains of the city &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is partitive, just as &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>) is shamma&#770;h (desolation), to which the whole city has been brought (compare <a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>). The strong gates, which once swarmed with men, are shattered to ruins (yuccath, like <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>, for yu&#772;cath, Ges. 67, Anm. 8; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;, a predicating noun of sequence, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>, "into desolated heaps;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>, etc., and other passages). In the whole circuit of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>; ha&#770;'a&#770;retz is "the earth" here as in <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-24.htm">Isaiah 19:24</a>), and in the midst of what was once a crowd of nations (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6-7</a>), there is only a small remnant of men left. This is the leading thought, which runs through the book of Isaiah from beginning to end, and is figuratively depicted here in a miniature of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4-6</a>. The state of things produced by the catastrophe is compared to the olive-beating, which fetches down what fruit was left at the general picking, and to the gleaning of the grapes after the vintage has been fully gathered in (ca&#770;la&#770;h is used here as in <a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>, etc., viz., "to be over," whereas in <a href="/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a> it means to be hopelessly lost, as in <a href="/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>). There are no more men in the whole of the wide world than there are of olives and grapes after the principal gathering has taken place. The persons saved belong chiefly, though not exclusively, to Israel (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>). The place where they assemble is the land of promise. </body></html>
