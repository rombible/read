It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord was ready to save me - He was prompt, quick to save me.

His intention now is to take continual part with the Levites in (he choral praises of God, which were a part of the daily worship of the temple.

Be bail for me." <p>The meaning of shivvithi may be seen from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a>, in accordance with which an Arabic translator has rendered the passage, "I smoothed, i.e., quieted (sa&#770;weitu) my soul, notwithstanding the sickness, all night, until the morning." But the morning brought no improvement; the violence of the pain, crushing him like a lion, forced from him again and again the mournful cry, that he must die before the day had passed, and should not live to see another. The Masora here has a remark, which is of importance, as bearing upon <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, viz., that &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; occurs twice, and &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497; with two different meanings. The meaning of &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; is determined by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>, from which it is evident that &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is not an attribute of &#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505; here, in the sense of "chirping mournfully," or "making a circle in its flight," but is the name of a particular bird, namely the crane. For although the Targum and Syriac both seem to render &#1505;&#1493;&#1505; in that passage (keri &#1505;&#1497;&#1505;, which is the chethib here, according to the reading of Orientals) by &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;) (a crane, Arab. Kurki), and &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, by &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;) (the ordinary name of the swallow, which Haji Gaon explains by the Arabic chuttaf), yet the relation is really the reverse: su&#772;s (s&#305;&#772;s) is the swallow, and &#8219;a&#770;gu&#772;r the crane. Hence Rashi, on b. Kiddusin 44a ("then cried Res Lakis like a crane"), gives a&#770;g, Fr. grue, as the rendering of &#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;; whereas Parchon (s.verse &#8219;a&#770;gu&#772;r), confounds the crane with the hoarsely croaking stork (ciconia alba). The verb 'a&#774;tsaphtse&#772;ph answers very well not only to the flebile murmur of the swallow (into which the penitential Progne was changed, according to the Grecian myth), but also to the shrill shriek of the crane, which is caused by the extraordinary elongation of the windpipe, and is onomatopoetically expressed in its name &#8219;a&#770;gu&#772;r.<p>(Note: The call of the parent cranes, according to Naumann (Vgel Deutschlands, ix. 364), is a rattling kruh (gruh), which is uncommonly violent when close, and has a trumpet-like sound, which makes it audible at a very great distance. With the younger cranes it has a somewhat higher tone, which often passes, so to speak, into a falsetto.)<p>Tsiphtse&#772;ph, like &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, is applied to every kind of shrill, penetrating, inarticulate sound. The ordinary meaning of dallu&#772;, to hang long and loose, has here passed over into that of pining (syn. ka&#770;la&#770;h). The name of God in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> is Adonai, not Jehovah, being one of the 134 &#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., words which are really written Adonai, and not merely to be read so.<p>(Note: Vid., Br, Psalterium, p. 133.)<p>It is impossible to take &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497; as an imperative. The pointing, according to which we are to read &#8219;ashqa, admits this (compare sha&#770;mra&#770;h in <a href="/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-167.htm">Psalm 119:167</a>; and on the other hand, zochra&#772;lli, in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>, etc.);<p>(Note: Vid., Br, Thorath Emeth, pp. 22, 23.)<p>continued...</body></html>
