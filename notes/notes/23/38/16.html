It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, by these things men live - The design of this and the following verses is evidently to set forth the goodness of God, and to celebrate his praise for what he had done. The phrase 'these things,' refers evidently to the promises of God and their fulfillment; and the idea is, that people are sustained in the land of the living only by such gracious interpositions as he had experienced. It was not because people had any power of preserving their own lives, but because God interposed in time of trouble, and restored to health when there was no human prospect that they could recover.<p>And in all these things - In these promises, and in the divine interposition.<p>Is the life of my spirit - I am alive in virtue only of these things.<p>So wilt thou recover me - Or so hast thou recovered me; that is, thou hast restored me to health. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. by these&#8212;namely, by God's benefits, which are implied in the context (Isa 38:15, "He hath Himself done it" "unto me").

Not by bread only, but by the word of God: by the promise of God, and by his power performing it; and by his favour and goodness continually bestowed; it is in him, and by his power and providence, that they live and move, and have their being, and the continuance of it; and it is his lovingkindness manifested to them that makes them live comfortably and go on cheerfully: <p>and in all these things is the life of my spirit; what kept his soul in life were the same things, the promise, power, and providence of God; what revived his spirit, and made him comfortable and cheerful, was the wonderful love and great goodness of God unto him, in appearing to him, and for him, and delivering him out of his sore troubles. Ben Melech renders and gives the sense of the words thus; "to all will I declare and say, that in these", in the years of addition (the fifteen years added to his days) "are the life of my spirit"; so Kimchi. The Targum interprets it of the resurrection of the dead, <p>"O Lord, concerning all the dead, thou hast said, that thou wilt quicken them; and before them all thou hast quickened my spirit:'' <p>so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live; or rather, "and" or "for thou hast recovered (t) me, and made me to live"; for the Lord had not only promised it, but he had done it, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, and so the Targum, <p>"and hast quickened me, and sustained me.'' <p>(t) So Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O Lord, <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> by these <i>things men</i> live, and in all these <i>things is</i> the life of my spirit: so wilt thou <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> restore me, and make me to live.</span><p>(q) They who will outlive the men that are now alive, and all they who are in these years will acknowledge this blessing.<p>(r) That after that you had condemned me to death you restored me to life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

The verb “live” closely resembles an Aramaic verb (<span class="ital">ḥivvâh</span> occurring several times in the O.T.) meaning “to declare”; and this was evidently read by LXX.: <span class="greekheb">περὶ αὐτῆς γὰρ ἀνηγγέλη σοι</span>.

On the cohortative, in the sense of that which is to be, see Ewald, 228, a; &#1488;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;, according to its verbal idea, has the same meaning as in <a href="/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>; and the construction with &#1489;&#1468; ( equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;) is constructio praegnans (Luzzatto). The pual &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean, "I am made to want" (Rashi, Knobel, and others), which, as the passive of the causative, would rather be &#1492;&#1508;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, like &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, I am made to inherit (<a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>); but, I am visited with punishment as to the remnant, mulcted of the remainder, deprived, as a punishment, of the rest of my years. The clause, "Jah in the land of the living," i.e., the God of salvation, who reveals Himself in the land of the living, is followed by the corresponding clause, &#1492;&#1491;&#1500; &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, "I dwelling with the inhabitants of the region of the dead;" for whilst &#1492;&#1500;&#1491; signifies temporal life (from cha&#770;lad, to glide imperceptibly away, <a href="/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>), &#1492;&#1500;&#1491; signifies the end of this life, the negation of all conscious activity of being, the region of the dead. The body is called a dwelling (do&#772;r, Arab. da&#770;r), as the home of a man who possesses the capacity to distinguish himself from everything belonging to him (Psychol. p. 227). It is compared to a nomadic tent. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; (a different word from that in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>, where it is the chirek compaginis) is not a genitive ( equals  &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, Ewald, 151, b), but an adjective in i, like &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in <a href="/zechariah/11-15.htm">Zechariah 11:15</a>.

The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1; &#1511;&#1508;&#1491; might mean to cut off, or shorten (related to qa&#770;phach); it is safer, however, and more appropriate, to take it in the sense of rolling up, as in the name of the badger (<a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>), since otherwise what Hezekiah says of himself and of God would be tautological. I rolled or wound up my life, as the weaver rolls up the finished piece of cloth: i.e., I was sure of my death, namely, because God was about to give me up to death; He was about to cut me off from the thrum (the future is here significantly interchanged with the perfect). Dalla&#770;h is the thrum, licium, the threads of the warp upon a loom, which becomes shorter and shorter the further the weft proceeds, until at length the piece is finished, and the weaver cuts through the short threads, and so sets it free (&#1489;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;, cf., <a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>). The strophe closes with the deep lamentation which the sufferer poured out at that time: he could not help feeling that God would put an end to him (sha&#770;lam, syn. ka&#770;la&#770;h, ta&#770;mam, ga&#770;mar) from day to night, i.e., in the shortest time possible (compare <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>). </body></html>
