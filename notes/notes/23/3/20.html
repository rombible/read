Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bonnets - The "tiara, head-dress, or turban." The word comes from the verb "to adorn." The "turban" is almost universally worn in the East. It was worn by the priests, <a href="/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a>; by the bridegroom, <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; and by women. Its form is well known.<p>And the ornaments for the legs - The word used here is derived from a verb signifying "to walk, to go," particularly to walk in a stately and formal manner - with a measured step, &#1492;&#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;  hatse&#8219;a&#772;do&#770;th, from &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;  tsa&#770;&#8219;ad; and thus refers to a proud and lofty gait. The "ornament" which is here referred to is supposed to have been a short chain extending from one foot to the other, worn by the Eastern women to give them a measured and stately gait. - "Gesenius." This "chain" is supposed to have been attached by hooks or clasps to the 'tinkling ornaments' mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>. Safieri mentions these ornaments, and thus describes them: 'The word denotes a small chain, with which females, when they walk, connect their feet, in order to make their steps equal.' Happily these ornaments are unknown in modern times, at least in Western countries. They are still retained in the East.<p>And the head-bands - This word means "girdles" of any kind, still commonly worn on the head. A picture in the book illustrates one of the usual forms of the head-band.<p>And the tablets - The Hebrew is, as in the margin, 'the houses of the soul.' The word translated "soul" means also the "breath;" and hence, as one of its meanings, that which is "breathed," "or which is smelled; "scent; fragrancy, odor." The word "houses" here may denote also "boxes" - as boxes of perfumes. The phrase here means, undoubtedly, "smelling boxes" or "bottles," containing perfumes or fragrant odors. The word "tablets" has no meaning here.<p>And the ear-rings - It is by no means certain that the original means ear-rings. The word &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  lecha&#772;sh&#305;&#770;ym is derived from the verb &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  la&#770;chash signifying "to whisper," and then "to conjure, to charm" (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>); and here probably denotes precious stones worn by the females as "amulets" or "charms." The word is often used to denote charming "serpents" - from their "hissing" and it has been supposed probable that these amulets were small images of serpents. There is no doubt that such ornaments were worn by Oriental females. 'These ornaments seem to have been amulets, often gems and precious stones, or plates of gold and silver, on which certain magic formulas were inscribed, which were worn suspended from the neck or ears by Oriental females.' - "Gesenius." The following extract will furnish an explanation of these ornaments: 'Besides ornamental rings in the nose and the ears, they (Oriental females) wore others round the legs, which made a tinkling as they went.<p>This custom has also descended to the present times, for Rauwolf met with a number of Arabian women on the Euphrates, whose ankles and wrists were adorned with rings, sometimes a good many together, which, moving up and down as they walked, made a great noise. Chardin attests the existence of the same custom in Persia, in Arabia, and in very hot countries, where they commonly go without stockings, but ascribes the tinkling sound to little bells fastened to those rings. In the East Indies, golden bells adorned the feet and ankles of the ladies from the earliest times; they placed them in the flowing tresses of their hair; they suspended them round their necks, and to the golden rings which they wore on their fingers, to announce their superior rank, and extort the homage which they had a right to expect from the lower orders; and from the banks of the Indus, it is probable the custom was introduced into the other countries of Asia. The Arabian females in Palestine and Syria delight in the same ornaments, and, according to the statements of Dr. Clarke, seem to claim the honor of leading the fashion.' - 'Their bodies are covered with a long blue tunic; upon their heads they wear two handkerchiefs, one as a hood, and the other bound over it, as a fillet across the temples.<p>Just above the right nostril, they place a small button, sometimes studded with pearl, a piece of glass, or any other glittering substance; this is fastened by a plug, thrust through the cartilage of the nose. Sometimes they have the cartilaginous separation between the nostrils bored for a ring, as large as those ordinarily used in Europe for hanging curtains; and this pendant in the upperlip covers the mouth; so that, in order to eat, it is necessary to raise it. Their faces, hands, and arms are tatooed, and covered with hideous scars; their eyelashes and eyes being always painted, or rather dirtied, with some dingy black or blue powder. Their lips are dyed of a deep and dusky blue, as if they had been eating blackberries. Their teeth are jet black; their nails and fingers brick red; their wrists, as well as their ankles, are laden with large metal cinctures, studded with sharp pyramidical knobs and bits of glass. Very ponderous rings are also placed in their ears.' - "Paxton." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. bonnets&#8212;turbans.<p>ornaments of the legs&#8212;the short stepping-chains from one foot to another, to give a measured gait; attached to the "tinkling ornaments" (Isa 3:16).<p>headbands&#8212;literally, "girdles."<p>tablets&#8212;rather, "houses of the breath," that is, smelling boxes [Vulgate].<p>earrings&#8212;rather, amulets suspended from the neck or ears, with magic formul&aelig; inscribed; the root means to "whisper" or "conjure."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The bonnets:</span> these were ornaments to cover the head, common both to men, as <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a></span>, and to women, as here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The tablets, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the houses of the soul, or of life, or of breath</span>; whereby he seems to mean boxes of excellent perfumes, which are of great efficacy to revive our drooping spirits, and to that end are oft applied to such as are ready to faint away. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The bonnets,....

It is quite uncertain what this was, since we have no representations of Hebrew women. Egyptian women commonly wore a mere fillet with pendant ends. The Hebrew word here employed is used in Exodus of the head-dress of the priests (Exodus 39:28). The ornaments of the legs. These are explained as chains connecting the two anklets together.

Scent-bottles and jars for holding sweet-smelling unguents are among the most frequent toilette articles recovered from Egyptian tombs and Assyrian palaces. Amulets have been worn in the East from very ancient times, and are still trusted in as much as ever. They frequently take the form of ornaments. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Jehovah will proceed to judgment with the elders of His people, and its princes. And ye, ye have eaten up the vineyard; prey of the suffering is in your houses. What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the suffering? Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts." The words of God Himself commence with "and ye" (v'attem). The sentence to which this (et vos  equals  at vos) is the antithesis is wanting, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, where the words of God commence with "and I" (va'ani, et ego  equals  ast ego). the tacit clause may easily be supplied, viz., I have set you over my vineyard, but he have consumed the vineyard. The only question is, whether the sentence is to be regarded as suppressed by Jehovah Himself, or by the prophet. Most certainly by Jehovah Himself. The majesty with which He appeared before the rulers of His people as, even without words, a practical and undeniable proof that their majesty was only a shadow of His, and their office His trust. But their office consisted in the fact that Jehovah had committed His people to their care. The vineyard of Jehovah was His people - a self-evident figure, which the prophet dresses up in the form of a parable in chapter 5. Jehovah had appointed them as gardeners and keepers of this vineyard, but they themselves have become the very beasts that they ought to have warded off. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is applied to the beasts which completely devour the blades of a corn-field or the grapes of a vineyard (<a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>). This change was perfectly obvious. The possessions stolen from their unhappy countrymen, which were still in their houses, were the tangible proof of their plundering of the vineyard. "The suffering:" ani (depressus, the crushed) is introduced as explanatory of haccerem, the prey, because depression and misery were the ordinary fate of the congregation which God called His vineyard. It was ecclesia pressa, but woe to the oppressors! In the question "what mean ye?" (malla&#770;cem) the madness and wickedness of their deeds are implied. &#1502;&#1492; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; are fused into one word here, as if it were a prefix (as in <a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>; vid., Ges. 20, 2). The Keri helps to make it clear by resolving the chethibh. The word malla&#770;cem ought, strictly speaking, to be followed by chi: "What is there to you that ye crush my people?" as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a>; but the words rush forwards (as in <a href="/jonah/1-6.htm">Jonah 1:6</a>), because they are an explosion of wrath. For this reason the expressions relating to the behaviour of the rulers are the strongest that can possibly be employed. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; (crush) is also to be met with in <a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>; but "grind the face" (ta&#770;chan p'ne) is a strong metaphor without a parallel. The former signifies "to pound," the latter "to grind," as the millstone grinds the corn. They grind the faces of those who are already bowed down, thrusting them back with such unmerciful severity, that they stand as it were annihilated, and their faces become as white as flour, or as the Germans would say, cheese-white, chalk-white, as pale as death, from oppression and despair. Thus the language supplied to a certain extent appropriate figures, with which to describe the conduct of the rulers of Israel; but it contained no words that could exhaust the immeasurable wickedness of their conduct: hence the magnitude of their sin is set before them in the form of a question, "What is to you?" i.e., What indescribable wickedness is this which you are committing? The prophet hears this said by Jehovah, the majestic Judge, whom he here describes as Adonai Elohim Zebaoth (according to the Masoretic pointing). This triplex name of God, which we find in the prophetic books, viz., frequently in Amos and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, occurs for the first time in the Elohistic Psalm, <a href="/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a>. This scene of judgment is indeed depicted throughout in the colours of the Psalms, and more especially recals the (Elohistic) Psalm of Asaph (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1-8</a>). </body></html>
