So we have the three “captains of fifty” in <a href="/context/2_kings/1-9.htm" title="Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.">2Kings 1:9-15</a>. The “honourable man” (literally, <span class= "ital">eminent in countenance</span>) would seem to occupy a position in the civil service of the State analogous to that of the “captain of fifty” in the military.<p><span class= "bld">The counsellor, and the cunning artificer.</span>—From the modern stand-point the two classes seem at opposite extremes of the social order. The latter, however (literally, <span class= "ital">masters in arts</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>would seem to have occupied a higher position in the East, like that of military or civil engineers or artists with us. So in <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2Kings 24:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, the “craftsmen and the smiths” are grouped with the “men of might” who were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, and contrasted with the poor who were left behind. The military works of Uzziah had doubtless given a prominence to the “cunning men” who were employed on them (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm" title="And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and on the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones with.

Here, however, the thought is rather that of one who says the right words at the right time; or possibly the enchanter who has his formulæ (the word implies the whisper of incantations, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>) ready at command for all occasions.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3.

The idea is, that the commanders of the various divisions of the army should be taken away.<p>The honourable man - Hebrew &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;  nes'u&#770;' pa&#770;n&#305;&#770;ym. "The man of elevated countenance." That is, the man high in office. He was so called from the aspect of dignity which a man in office would assume. In the previous chapter, the phrase is used to denote rather the "pride" which attended such officers, than the dignity of the office itself.<p>And the counselor - Note, <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>.<p>The cunning artificer - Hebrew, The man wise in mechanic arts: skilled in architecture, etc.<p>And the eloquent orator - &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;  nebo&#770;n la&#770;chash. literally, skilled or learned in whispering, in conjuration, in persuasion. The word &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  lachash denotes properly a whispering, sighing, or calling for help; (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>, 'they have poured out a prayer,' &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  lachash - a secret speech, a feeble sigh for aid.) It is applied to the charm of the serpents - the secret breathing or gentle noise by which the charm is supposed to be effected; <a href="/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>. In <a href="/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a> of this chapter it denotes a charm or amulet worn by females; see the note at that verse. It is also applied to magic, or conjuration - because this was usually done by gentle whispering, or incantation; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>. From this use of the word, it comes to denote one that influences another; one who persuades him in any way, as an orator does by argument and entreaty. Ancient orators also probably sometimes used a species of recitative, or measured cadence, not unlike that employed by those who practiced incantations. Jerome says that it means here, 'a man who is learned, and acquainted with the law, and the prophets.' Chaldee, 'The prudent in council.' It "may" be used in a good sense here; but if so, it is probably the only place where the word is so used in the Old Testament. A prophecy similar to this occurs in <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a> : 'For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. captain of fifty&#8212;not only captains of thousands, and centurions of a hundred, but even semi-centurions of fifty, shall fail.<p>honourable&#8212;literally, "of dignified aspect."<p>cunning&#8212;skilful.

So far should there be from being captains of thousands, and of hundreds, that there should not be one of fifty: <p>and the honourable man; by birth, breeding, and behaviour, through riches and greatness; and one of power and authority among the people, and in their favour and esteem: <p>and the counsellor; one able to give advice in matters of moment and difficulty, and in controversy between man and man; it suggests that nothing should be done with advice and counsel, with wisdom and discretion, but all tumult and sedition, as the history of these times shows: the Jews (b) interpret this of one that knows how to intercalate years, and fix the months: and the <p>cunning artificer: in any kind of metal, old, silver, brass, and iron, and in any sort of wood, and in any kind of manual and mechanical business; which would now be laid aside, shops shuts up, and all trade and business neglected and discouraged, occasioned partly by the siege without, and chiefly by their internal divisions and robberies, and by their zealots and cutthroats, which swarmed among them. The Septuagint render it, "the wise architect", or "masterbuilder"; the same word is used by the apostle in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>, <p>and the eloquent orator; who has the tongue of the learned, and can speak a word in season to the distressed; or who is able to plead at the bar the cause of the injured and oppressed, the widow and the fatherless. Aben Ezra interprets it of one that is skilful in enchanting serpents; that charms wisely, as in <a href="/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a> it may be rendered, "one that understands enchantment" (c): with the Septuagint it is a "prudent hearer"; sad is the case of a nation when men of so much usefulness are taken away from them.

Mea&#770;ra&#770;h is a natural cave, and mechillah a subterraneous excavation: this is apparently the distinction between the two synonyms. "To put the earth in terror:" la&#770;rotz ha&#770;-aretz, a significant paronomasia, which can be reproduced in Latin, thus: ut terreat terram. Thus the judgment would fall upon the earth without any limitation, upon men universally (compare the word ha&#770;-a&#770;da&#770;m in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>, which is scarcely ever applied to a single individual (<a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>), excepting, of course, the first man, but generally to men, or to the human race) and upon the totality of nature as interwoven in the history of man - one complete whole, in which sin, and therefore wrath, had gained the upper hand. When Jehovah rose up, i.e., stood up from His heavenly throne, to reveal the glory manifested in heaven, and turn its judicial fiery side towards the sinful earth, the earth would receive such a shock as would throw it into a state resembling the chaos of the beginning. We may see very clearly from <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>, where this description is borrowed, that the prophet is here describing the last judgment, although from a national point of view and bounded by a national horizon. </body></html>
