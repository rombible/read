He will call men to a strict account for all the wealth and power intrusted to and abused by them.

Both expressions show indignation and resentment; he rises up out of his place, and stands up in defence of his cause, and avenges himself on a wicked and ungrateful people: it seems to have reference to the judgments of God on the people of the Jews, the tribes of Israel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. The verse reads: <span class="bld">Jehovah has stationed himself to plead, and is standing to Judge peoples</span>. Instead of “peoples” LXX. reads “his people” (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm" title="For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>), which is easier, since there is nothing to indicate that a world-judgment is contemplated. It is doubtful whether the word can denote the separate tribes of Israel. If the Heb. text be retained, the idea must be that of a general assize, in which Israel is judged first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">13–15</span>. A judgment scene, somewhat loosely connected with what has gone before, but expressing in another form the same sympathy with the oppressed which appears in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm" title="As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.

The <span class="accented">great</span> sin of the time was oppression of the poor by the rich, and especially by the rulers (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 17, 21</a>). In noticing this, the prophet, to give more weight to his denunciation, introduces Jehovah as standing up, and coming forward on the popular side, to plead the people's cause, and remonstrate with their oppressors. There is great force in this sudden entrance on the scene of Jehovah himself, as Pleader and Judge. <span class="cmt_word">And... judge the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the peoples</span>. Primarily, Israel is God's care; but he does not stop at this point. All the nations of the earth are also under his protection. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At length there would be no authorities left; even the desire to rule would die out: for despotism is sure to be followed by mob-rule, and mob-rule by anarchy in the most literal sense. The distress would become so great, that whoever had a coat (cloak), so as to be able to clothe himself at all decently, would be asked to undertake the government. "When a man shall take hold of his brother in his father's house, Thou hast a coat, thou shalt be our ruler, and take this ruin under thy hand; he will cry out in that day, I do not want to be a surgeon; there is neither bread nor coat in my house: ye cannot make me the ruler of the people." "his father's house" - this is not an unmeaning trait in the picture of misery. The population would have become so thin and dispirited through hunger, that with a little energy it would be possible to decide within the narrow circle of a family who should be ruler, and to give effect to the decision. "In his father's house:" Beth a&#770;biv is an acc. loci. The father's house is the place where brother meets with brother; and one breaks out with the urgent petition contained in the words, which follow without the introductory "saying" (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-16.htm">Isaiah 14:16</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>). &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; for &#1500;&#1498; with He otians, a form rarely met with (vid., <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, which would be written &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; before the predicate, is jussive in meaning, though not in form. "This ruin:" macshelah is used in <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> for that which occasions a person's fall; here it signifies what has been overthrown; and as Ca&#770;shal itself, which means not only to stumble, strip, or slide, but also to fall in consequence of some force applied from without, is not used in connection with falling buildings, it must be introduced here with an allusion to the prosopopeia which follows in <a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>. The man who was distinguished above all others, or at any rate above many others, by the fact that he could still dress himself decently (even if it were only in a blouse), should be made supreme ruler or dictator (cf., ka&#770;tzin, <a href="/judges/11-6.htm">Judges 11:6</a>); and the state which lay so miserably in ruins should be under his hand, i.e., his direction, protection, and care (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-35.htm">Genesis 41:35</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>, where the plural is used instead of the ordinary singular ya&#770;d.) The apodosis to the protasis introduced with Chi as a particle of time (when) commences in <a href="/isaiah/3-7.htm">Isaiah 3:7</a>. The answer given by the brother to the earnest petition is introduced with "he will raise (viz., his voice, <a href="/isaiah/24-14.htm">Isaiah 24:14</a>) in that day, saying." It is given in this circumstantial manner because it is a solemn protest. He does not want to be a Chobe&#772;sh, i.e., a binder, namely of the broken arms, and bones, and ribs of the ruined state (<a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). The expression ehyeh implies that he does not like it, because he is conscious of his inability. He has not confidence enough in himself, and the assumption that he has a coat is a false cone: he not only has no coat at home (we must remember that the conversation is supposed to take place in his father's house), but he has not any bread; so that it is utterly impossible for a naked, starving man like him to do what is suggested ("in my house," ubebethi with a Vav of causal connection: Ges. 155, 1, c). </body></html>
