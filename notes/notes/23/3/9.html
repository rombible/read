There is a correspondence between the feeling of the heart and the looks, an "answering" of the countenance to the purposes of the soul that shows their true character, and betrays their plans. The prophet refers here to the great law in physiology that the emotions of the heart will be usually "expressed" in the countenance; and that by the marks of pride, vanity, and malice there depicted, we may judge of the heart; or as it is expressed in our translation, that the expression of the face will "witness" against a wicked man.<p>They declare ... - By their deeds.

The word translated "shew" is only used in this place. Some derive it from  "to know", in the conjugations Piel and Hiphil; and render it, "the knowledge of their countenance" (f); that is, that which may be known by their countenances; the countenance oftentimes shows what is in the heart, the cruel disposition of the mind, the pride and vanity of it, the uncleanness and lasciviousness that is in it; to this our version agrees, and which is confirmed by the Chaldee paraphrase, <p>"the knowledge of their countenance in judgment doth testify against them;'' <p>as they appear there, so it may be judged of them; their guilt flies in their face, and fills them with shame and confusion; and so the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "the shame of their face"; but others derive it from  which has the signification of hardness in the Arabic language, and as it is thought by some to have in <a href="/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a> and render it, "the hardness of their countenance"; so R. Joseph Kimchi, and others (g), meaning their impudence (h); not only their words and actions, but their impudent looks, show what they are; which agrees with what follows: <p>and they declare their sin as Sodom, and <p>hide it not; commit it openly, without fear or shame; glory in it, and boast of it, as the Jews did in their crucifixion of Christ, and their evil treatment of him: <p>woe to their soul, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves; they have brought upon themselves, soul and body, the just recompence of reward; they have been the cause of their own ruin, and have wronged their own souls. <p>(f)  "cognitio vultus eorum", Munster, Vatablus, V.

As the state had grown into a military state under Uzziah-Jotham, the prophet commences in both vv. with military officers, viz., the gibbor, i.e., commanders whose bravery had been already tried; the "man of war" (ish imlcha&#770;ma&#770;h), i.e., private soldiers who had been equipped and well trained (see <a href="/ezekiel/39-20.htm">Ezekiel 39:20</a>); and the "captain of fifty" (sar Chamisshim), leaders of the smallest divisions of the army, consisting of only fifty men (pentekontarchos, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>, etc.). The prominent members of the state are all mixed up together; "the judge" (shophet), i.e., the officers appointed by the government to administer justice; "the elder" (za&#770;ke&#772;n), i.e., the heads of families and the senators appointed by the town corporations; the "counsellor" (yo&#772;etz), those nearest to the king; the "highly distinguished" (nesu panim), lit., those whose personal appearance (panim) was accepted, i.e., welcome and regarded with honour (Saad.: wa'g&#305;&#772;h, from wa'gh, the face of appearance), that is to say, persons of influence, not only on account of their office, but also on account of wealth, age, goodness, etc.; "masters in art" (Chacam Chara&#770;shim: lxx &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; ), or, as Jerome has very well rendered it, in artibus mechanicis exercitatus easque callide tractans (persons well versed in mechanical arts, and carrying them out with skill). In the Chaldean captivities skilled artisans are particularly mentioned as having been carried away (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>.; <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>); so that there can be no doubt whatever that Chara&#770;shim (from Cheresh) is to be understood as signifying mechanical and not magical arts, as Gesenius, Hitzig, and Meier suppose, and therefore that Chacam Chara&#770;shim does not mean "wizards," as Ewald renders it (Cha&#774;ra&#770;shim is a different word from Cha&#770;ra&#770;shim, fabri, from Cha&#770;ra&#770;sh, although in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-14.htm">1 Chronicles 4:14</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-35.htm">Nehemiah 11:35</a>, the word is regularly pointed &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; even in this personal sense). Moreover, the rendering "wizards" produces tautology, inasmuch as masters of the black art are cited as nebon lachash, "skilled in muttering." Lachash is the whispering or muttering of magical formulas; it is related both radically and in meaning to nachash, enchantment (Arabic nachs, misfortune); it is derived from lachash, sibilare, to hiss (a kindred word to na&#770;chash; hence na&#770;cha&#770;sh, a serpent). Beside this, the masters of the black art are also represented as kosem, which, in accordance with the radical idea of making fast, swearing, conjuring, denoted a soothsayer following heathen superstitions, as distinguished from the nabi, of false Jehovah prophet (we find this as early as <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-14.htm">Deuteronomy 18:14</a>).<p>(Note: According to the primary meaning of the whole thema, which is one of hardness, rigidity, firmness, aksama (hi. of ka&#770;sam) signifies, strictly speaking, to make sure, i.e., to swear, either by swearing to the truth and certainty of a thing, or by making a person swear that he will do or not do a certain thing, by laying as it were a kasam upon him. The kal, on the other hand (kasama), gets its meaning to divide from the turn given to the radical idea in the substantive kism, which signifies, according to the original lexicographers, something fixed ( equals  nas&#305;&#772;b), definite, i.e., a definite portion. There is just the same association of ideas in &#8219;azama as in aksama, namely, literally to be firm or make firm, i.e., to direct one's will firmly towards an object or place; also to direct one's will firmly towards a person, to adjure him to do a thing or not to do it; sometimes with a softer meaning, to urge or invite a person to anything, at other times to recite conjuring formulas (&#8219;aza&#770;im.)<p>These came next to bread and water, and were in a higher grade the props of the state. They are mixed together in this manner without regular order, because the powerful and splendid state was really a quodlibet of things Jewish and heathen; and when the wrath of Jehovah broke out, the godless glory would soon become a mass of confusion. </body></html>
