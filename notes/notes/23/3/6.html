The elder brother, the impoverished owner of the ruined dwelling, the head of a family or village, turns in his rags to the younger, whose decent garments seem to indicate comparative wealth, and would fain transfer to him the responsibilities of the first-born, though he has but a ruined tenement to give him. And instead of accepting what most men would have coveted (<a href="/context/genesis/25-31.htm" title="And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.">Genesis 25:31-33</a>), the younger brother rejects it. He has enough bread and clothing (same word as in <a href="/exodus/22-27.htm" title="For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.">Exodus 22:27</a>) for himself, and no more.

The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1.

The act of "taking hold" here denotes "supplication" and "entreaty," as when one in danger or distress clings to that which is near, or which may be likely to aid him; compare <a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>,<p>His brother - His kinsman, or one of the same tribe and family - claiming protection because they belonged to the same family.<p>Of the house of his father - Descended from the same paternal ancestors as himself. Probably this refers to one of an ancient and opulent family - a man who had kept himself from the civil broils and tumults of the nation, and who had retained his property safe in the midst of the surrounding desolation. In the previous verse, the prophet had said that one characteristic of the times would be a want of respect for "the aged" and "the honorable." He here says that such would be the distress, that a man would be "compelled" to show respect to rank; he would look to the ancient and wealthy families for protection.<p>Thou hast clothing - In ancient times wealth consisted very much in changes of garments; and the expression, 'thou hast clothing,' is the same as 'you are rich, you are able to assist us;' see <a href="/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>.<p>And let this ruin ... - This is an expression of entreaty. 'Give us assistance, or defense. We commit our ruined and dilapidated affairs to thee, and implore thy help.' The Septuagint reads this, 'and let my food,' that is, my support, 'be under thee' - do thou furnish me food. There are some other unimportant variations in the ancient versions, but the sense is substantially given in our translation. It is expressive of great distress and anarchy - when there would be no ruler, and every man would seek one for himself. The whole deportment evinced here by the suppliant is one of submission, distress, and humility. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

A new departure. In the general anarchy described (vers. 4, 5) it will be felt that something must be done. A man will take hold of his brother (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his fellow) in his (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the latter's) father's house, where he lives in seclusion, and say to him, "Thou hast clothing" (or, "thou art decently clad"), "thou must be our ruler; let this ruin" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "this ruined state") "be under thy band." <span class="cmt_word">This ruin</span>; literally, <span class="accented">this stumbling-block</span> (see <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>; and compare the uniform translation of the kindred noun <span class="accented">mikshol</span> (<a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>; Ezekiel 52:20; 7:10, etc.). The Jewish community is meant, which was full of stumbling itself, and might well cause all those to stumble who came into contact with it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"To creep into the cavities of the stone-blocks, and into the clefts of the rocks, before the terrible look of Jehovah, and before the glory of His majesty, when He arises to put the earth in terror." Thus ends the fourth strophe of this "dies irae, dies illa," which is appended to the earlier prophetic word. But there follows, as an epiphonem, this nota bene in <a href="/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> : Oh, then, let man go, in whose nose is a breath; for what is he estimated at? The Septuagint leaves this v. out altogether. But was it so utterly unintelligible then? Jerome adopted a false pointing, and has therefore given this marvellous rendering: excelsus (ba&#770;ma&#770;h!) reputatus est ipse, by which Luther was apparently misled. But if we look backwards and forwards, it is impossible to mistake the meaning of the verse, which must be regarded not only as the resultant of what precedes it, but also as the transition to what follows. It is preceded by the prediction of the utter demolition of everything which ministers to the pride and vain confidence of men; and in <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>. the same prediction is resumed, with a more special reference to the Jewish state, from which Jehovah is about to take away every prop, so that it shall utterly collapse. Accordingly the prophet exhorts, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a>, to a renunciation of trust in man, and everything belonging to him, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>. The construction is as general as that of a gnome. The dat. Commodi &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (Ges. 154, 3, e) renders the exhortation both friendly and urgent: from regard to yourselves, for your own good, for your own salvation, desist from man, i.e., from your confidence in him, in whose nose (in cujus naso, the singular, as in <a href="/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>; whereas the plural is used in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> in the same sense, in nares ejus, "into his nostrils") is a breath, a breath of life, which God gave to him, and can take back as soon as He will (<a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). Upon the breath, which passes out and in through his nose, his whole earthly existence is suspended; and this, when once lost, is gone for ever (<a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>). It is upon this breath, therefore, that all the confidence placed in man must rest - a bad soil and foundation! Under these conditions, and with this liability to perish in a moment, the worth of man as a ground of confidence is really nothing. This thought is expressed here in the form of a question: At (for) what is he estimated, or to be estimated? The passive participle nechsha&#770;b combines with the idea of the actual (aestimatus) that of the necessary (aestimandus), and also of the possible or suitable (aestimabilis); and that all the more because the Semitic languages have no special forms for the latter notions. The Beth is Beth pret&#305;&#772;, corresponding to the Latin genitive (quanti) or ablative (quanto) - a modification of the Beth instrumenti, the price being regarded as the medium of exchange or purchase: "at what is he estimated," not with what is he compared, which would be expressed by &#8219;eth (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>; compare &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, <a href="/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>) or &#8219;im (<a href="/psalms/88-5.htm">Psalm 88:5</a>). The word is &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, because this looser form is only found in cases where a relative clause follows (eo quod, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>), and not bama equals h, because this termination with a&#772; is used exclusively where the next word begins with Aleph, or where it is a pausal word (as in <a href="/1_kings/22-21.htm">1 Kings 22:21</a>); in every other case we have bammeh. The question introduced with this quanto (quanti), "at what," cannot be answered by any positive definition of value. The worth of man, regarded in himself, and altogether apart from God, is really nothing. <p>The proclamation of judgment pauses at this porisma, but only for the purpose of gathering fresh strength. The prophet has foretold in four strophes the judgment of God upon every exalted thing in the kosmos that has fallen away from communion with God, just as Amos commences his book with a round of judgments, which are uttered in seven strophes of uniform scope, bursting like seven thunder-claps upon the nations of the existing stage of history. The seventh stroke falls upon Judah, over which the thunderstorm rests after finding such abundant booty. And in the same manner Isaiah, in the instance before us, reduces the universal proclamation of judgment to one more especially affecting Judah and Jerusalem. The current of the address breaks through the bounds of the strophe; and the exhortation in <a href="/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> not to trust in man, the reason for which is assigned in what precedes, also forms a transition from the universal proclamation of judgment to the more special one in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, where the prophet assigns a fresh ground for the exhortation. </body></html>
