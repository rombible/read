But we must observe, that the prophet here does not address the women themselves, but Zion, which frequently is spoken of and represented in the character of a woman. <span class="ital">Her gates shall lament </span>— The gates of Zion, which, by a figure, are said to lament, to imply the great desolation of the place, that there would be no people to go out and come in by them, or to meet together there as they used to do. <span class="ital">And she, being desolate </span>— Bereaved of her children; Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נקתה</span>, <span class="ital">emptied, </span>or cleansed, that is, deprived of all that she had held dear, and delighted in; <span class="ital">shall sit upon the ground </span>— In the posture of a mourner, bewailing her sad calamity.

The Prophet Jeremiah has noticed it, in the first place, among many indications of sorrow, in an elegant description of this same state of distress of his country, <a href="/context/lamentations/2-8.htm" title="The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together....">Lamentations 2:8-10</a>. Thus also the psalmist, <span class="ital">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. </span>For, undoubtedly, Isaiah in this prophecy had in his view, at least first and immediately, the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and the dissolution of the Jewish state under the captivity of Babylon. His prediction, however, received a second, and still more awful accomplishment, in the destruction of that city and nation by the Romans. And, what is remarkable, in a medal coined by Vespasian’s order, Jerusalem is represented, according to the picture drawn of her here by the prophet, as lamenting that calamity, under the emblem of a woman sitting on the ground in a melancholy and mournful posture. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy men - This is an address to Jerusalem itself, by a change not uncommon in the writings of Isaiah.

"On that day the Lord will put away the show of the ankle-clasps, and of the head-bands, and of the crescents; the ear-rings, and the arm-chains, and the light veils; the diadems, and the stepping-chains, and the girdles, and the smelling-bottles, and the amulets; the finger-rings, and the nose-rings; the gala-dresses, and the sleeve-frocks, and the wrappers, and the pockets; the hand-mirrors, and the Sindu-cloths, and the turbans, and the gauze mantles." The fullest explanation of all these articles of female attire is to be found in N. W. Schrder's work, entitled Commentarius de vestitu mulierum Hebraearum ad Jes. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, Ludg. Batav 1745 (a quarto volume), and in that of Ant. Theod. Hartmann, consisting of three octavo volumes, and entitled Die Hebrerin am Putztische und als Braut (The Jewess at the Toilet-table, and as Bride, 1809-10); to which we may also add, Saalschtz, Archaeologie, chapter iii., where he treats of the dresses of men and women. It was not usually Isaiah's custom to enter into such minute particulars. Of all the prophets, Ezekiel was the one most addicted to this, as we may see, for example, from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>. And even in other prophecies against the women we find nothing of the kind again (<a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>.; <a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>.). But in this instance, the enumeration of the female ornaments is connected with that of the state props in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-3</a>, and that of the lofty and exalted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13-16</a>, so as to form a trilogy, and has its own special explanation in that boundless love of ornament which had become prevalent in the time of Uzziah-Jotham. It was the prophet's intention to produce a ludicrous, but yet serious impression, as to the immeasurable luxury which really existed; and in the prophetic address, his design throughout is to bring out the glaring contrast between the titanic, massive, worldly glory, in all its varied forms, and that true, spiritual, and majestically simple glory, whose reality is manifested from within outwards. In fact, the theme of the whole address is the way of universal judgment leading on from the false glory to the true. The general idea of tiphereth (show: rendered "bravery" in Eng. ver.) which stands at the head and includes the whole, points to the contrast presented by a totally different tiphereth which follows in <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>. In explaining each particular word, we must be content with what is most necessary, and comparatively the most certain. "Ankle-clasps" (aca&#770;sim): these were rings of gold, silver, or ivory, worn round the ankles; hence the denom. verb (icces) in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>, to make a tinkling sound with these rings. "Head-bands," or "frontlets" (shebisim, from sha&#770;bas  equals  sha&#770;batz: plectere), were plaited bands of gold or silver thread worn below the hair-net, and reaching from one ear to the other. There is some force, however, in the explanation which has been very commonly adopted since the time of Schrder, namely, that they were sun-like balls ( equals  shemisim), which were worn as ornaments round the neck, from the Arabic &#8219;sumeisa (&#8219;subeisa), a little sun. The "crescents" (saharonim) were little pendants of this kind, fastened round the neck and hanging down upon the breast (in <a href="/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a> we meet with them as ornaments hung round the camels' necks). Such ornaments are still worn by Arabian girls, who generally have several different kinds of them; the hila&#770;l, or new moon, being a symbol of increasing good fortune, and as such the most approved charm against the evil eye. "Ear-rings" (netiphoth, ear-drops): we meet with these in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, as an ornament worn by Midianitish kings. Hence the Arabic munattafe, a woman adorned with ear-rings. "Arm-chains:" sheroth, from sha&#770;ra, to twist. According to the Targum, these were chains worn upon the arm, or spangles upon the wrist, answering to the spangles upon the ankles. "Fluttering veils" (re'a&#770;loth, from ra&#770;'al, to hang loose): these were more expensive than the ordinary veils worn by girls, which were called tza'iph. <p>"Diadems" (pe'erim) are only mentioned in other parts of the Scriptures as being worn by men (e.g., by priests, bride-grooms, or persons of high rank). "Stepping-chains:" tze'a&#770;doth, from tze'a&#770;dah, a step; hence the chain worn to shorten and give elegance to the step. "Girdles:" kisshurim, from ka&#770;shar (Cingere), dress girdles, such as were worn by brides upon their wedding-day (compare <a href="/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a> with <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>); the word is erroneously rendered hair-pins (kalmasmezayyah) in the Targum. "Smelling-bottles:" botte hannephesh, holders of scent (nephesh, the breath of an aroma). "Amulets:" lechashim (from la&#770;chash, to work by incantations), gems or metal plates with an inscription upon them, which were worn as a protection as well as an ornament. "Finger-rings:" tabba&#770;'oth, from ta&#770;ba, to impress or seal, signet-rings worn upon the finger, corresponding to the Chotha&#770;m worn by men upon the breast suspended by a cord. "Nose-rings" (nizme&#770; ha&#770;aph) were fastened in the central division of the nose, and hung down over the mouth: they have been ornaments in common use in the East from the time of the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>) down to the present day. "Gala-dresses" (machala&#770;tsoth) are dresses not usually worn, but taken off when at home. "Sleeve-frocks" (ma'ata&#770;pha&#770;h): the second tunic, worn above the ordinary one, the Roman stola. "Wrappers" (mitpa&#770;choth, from ta&#770;phach, expandere), broad cloths wrapped round the body, such as Ruth wore when she crept in to Boaz in her best attire (<a href="/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). "Pockets" (Charitim) were for holding money (<a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>), which was generally carried by men in the girdle, or in a purse (Cis). "Hand-mirrors" (gilyonim): the Septuagint renders this &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;, sc. &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Lacedaemonian gauze or transparent dresses, which showed the nakedness rather than concealed it (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, retegere); but the better rendering is mirrors with handles, polished metal plates (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, polire), as gilla&#770;yon is used elsewhere to signify a smooth table. "Sindu-cloths" (sedinim), veils or coverings of the finest linen, viz., of Sindu or Hindu cloth (&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) - Sindu, the land of Indus, being the earlier name of India.<p>(Note: The Mishna (Kelim xxiv 13) mentions three different sedinin: night dresses, curtains, and embroidery. The sindon is frequently referred to as a covering wrapped round the person; and in b. Menachoth 41a, it is stated that the sindom is the summer dress, the sarbal (cloak) the winter dress, which may help to explain <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51-52</a>.)<p>"Turbans" (tseniphoth, from tsa&#770;naph, Convolvere), the head-dress composed of twisted cloths of different colours. "Gauze mantles" (redidim, from ra&#770;dad, extendere, tenuem facere), delicate veil-like mantles thrown over the rest of the clothes. Stockings and handkerchiefs are not mentioned: the former were first introduced into Hither Asia from Media long after Isaiah's time, and a Jerusalem lady no more thought of suing the latter than a Grecian or Roman lady did. Even the veil (burko) now commonly worn, which conceals the whole of the face with the exception of the eyes, did not form part of the attire of an Israelitish woman in the olden time.<p>(Note: Rashi, however, makes a different statement (Sabbath 65a), viz., that "Israelitish women in Arabia go out with veils which conceal the face, and those in Media with their mantles fastened about the mouth.")<p>The prophet enumerates twenty-one different ornaments: three sevens of a very bad kind, especially for the husbands of these state-dolls. There is no particular order observed in the enumeration, either from head to foot, or from the inner to the outer clothing; but they are arranged as much ad libitum as the dress itself. </body></html>
