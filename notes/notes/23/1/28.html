Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the destruction - Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;  sheber - the breaking, or crushing, that is, the punishment which was about to come upon them; compare <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<p>Of the transgressors - "Revolters," or those that rebel against God.<p>And of the sinners - Of all the sinners in the nation, of all kinds and degrees.<p>Together - At the same time with the redemption of Zion.<p>Shall be consumed - &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  y&#305;&#770;kelu&#770;, from &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;  ka&#770;la&#770;h, to be completed, or finished; to be consumed, wasted away; to vanish, or disappear.

"Thy silver has become dross, thy drink mutilated with water." It is upon this passage that the figurative language of <a href="/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18-22</a> is founded. Silver is here a figurative representation of the princes and lords, with special reference to the nobility of character naturally associated with nobility of birth and rank; for silver - refined silver - is an image of all that is noble and pure, light in all its purity being reflected by it (Bhr, Symbolik, i. 284). The princes and lords had once possessed all the virtues which the Latins called unitedly Candor animi, viz., the virtues of magnanimity, affability, impartiality, and superiority to bribes. This silver had now become l'sigim, dross, or base metal separated (thrown off) from silver in the process of refining (sig, pl. sigim, siggim from sug, recedere, refuse left in smelting, or dross: cf., <a href="/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-23.htm">Proverbs 26:23</a>). A second figure compares the leading men of the older Jerusalem to good wine, such as drinkers like. The word employed here (sobe) must have been used in this sense by the more cultivated classes in Isaiah's time (cf., <a href="/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>). This pure, strong, and costly wine was now adulterated with water (lit. castratum, according to Pliny's expression in the Natural History: compare the Horatian phrase, jugulare Falernum), and therefore its strength and odour were weakened, and its worth was diminished. The present was nothing but the dross and shadow of the past. </body></html>
