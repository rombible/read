It has to be remembered, however, that the prophet spoke to those who were unjust and selfish, and who were as yet far from the broken and contrite heart of the true penitent. He was content to wake up in them the dormant sense of righteousness, and to lead them to recognise the moral government of God. In the long run they would not be losers by a change of conduct. The choice of eating or “being eaten” (the “devoured” of <a href="/isaiah/1-20.htm" title="But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 1:20</a>), enjoying a blameless prosperity, or falling by the sword, was placed before those to whom the higher aspirations of the soul were little known.

We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing the good the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of the law could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7.

This was in accordance with the promises which God made to their fathers, and the motives to obedience placed before them, which were drawn from the fact, that they should possess a land of distinguished fertility, and that obedience should be attended with eminent national prosperity. Such an appeal was adapted to the infancy of society, and to the circumstances of the people. It should be added, however, that with this they connected the idea, that God would be their God and Protector; and, of course, the idea that all the blessings resulting from that fact would be theirs; <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> : 'And I am come down to deliver them out of the band of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;' compare <a href="/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-9</a>. In accordance with this, the language of promise in the New Testament is, that of inheriting the earth, that is, the land, Note, <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>. The expression here means, that if they obeyed God they should be under his patronage, and be prospered. It refers, also, to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>, where it is said, that strangers devoured the land. The promise here is, that if they were obedient, this calamity should be removed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19, 20. Temporal blessings in "the land of their possession" were prominent in the Old Testament promises, as suited to the childhood of the Church (Ex 3:17).

"Continue not to bring lying meat-offering; abomination incense is it to me." Minchah (the meat-offering) was the vegetable offering, as distinguished from zebach, the animal sacrifice. It is called a "lying meat-offering," as being a hypocritical dead work, behind which there was none of the feeling which it appeared to express. In the second clause the Sept., Vulg., Gesenius, and others adopt the rendering "incense - an abomination is it to me," ketoreth being taken as the name of the daily burning of incense upon the golden altar in the holy place (<a href="/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>). But neither in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, where prayer is offered by one who is not a priest, nor in the passage before us, where the reference is not to the priesthood, but to the people and to their deeds, is this continual incense to be thought of. Moreover, it is much more natural to regard the word ketoreth not as a bold absolute case, but, according to the conjunctive darga with which it is marked, as constructive rather; and this is perfectly allowable. The meat-offering is called "incense" (ketoreth) with reference to the so-called azcarah, i.e., that portion which the priest burned upon the altar, to bring the grateful offerer into remembrance before God (called "burning the memorial," hiktir azca&#770;ra&#770;h, in <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>). As a general rule, this was accompanied with incense (<a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>), the whole of which was placed upon the altar, and not merely a small portion of it. The meat-offering, with its sweet-smelling savour, was merely the form, which served as an outward expression of the thanksgiving for God's blessing, or the longing for His blessing, which really ascended in prayer. But in their case the form had no such meaning. It was nothing but the form, with which they thought they had satisfied God; and therefore it was an abomination to Him. <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. God was just as little pleased with their punctilious observance of the feasts: "New-moon and Sabbath, calling of festal meetings ... I cannot bear ungodliness and a festal crowd." The first objective notions, which are logically governed by "I cannot bear" (&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;: literally, a future hophal - I am unable, incapable, viz., to bear, which may be supplied, according to <a href="/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-21.htm">Proverbs 30:21</a>), become absolute cases here, on account of another grammatical object presenting itself in the last two nouns: "ungodliness and a festal crowd." As for new-moon and Sabbath (the latter always signifies the weekly Sabbath when construed with Chodesh) - and, in fact, the calling of meetings of the whole congregation on the weekly Sabbath and high festivals, which was a simple duty according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a> - Jehovah could not endure festivals associated with wickedness. &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, to press, or crowd thickly together) is synonymous with &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;), so far as its immediate signification is concerned, as <a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a> clearly shows, just as &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is synonymous with &#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; . &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, to breathe) is moral worthlessness, regarded as an utter absence of all that has true essence and worth in the sight of God. The prophet intentionally joins these two nouns together. A densely crowded festal meeting, combined with inward emptiness and barrenness on the part of those who were assembled together, was a contradiction which God could not endure. </body></html>
