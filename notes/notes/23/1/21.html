The idea of prostitution as representing apostasy from Jehovah was involved in the thought that Israel was the bride whom He had wooed and won (Hosea 1-3; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). The imagery was made more impressive by the fact that actual prostitution entered so largely into the ritual of many of the forms of idolatry to which the Israelites were tempted (<a href="/context/numbers/25-1.htm" title="And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab.">Numbers 25:1-2</a>). So Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/16-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 16:1-14</a>) develops the symbolism with an almost terrible fulness. So our Lord spoke of the Pharisees as an “adulterous generation” (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>). The fact that Hosea, an earlier contemporary, had been led to tell how he had been taught the truth thus set forth by a living personal experience, is not without significance in its bearing on the <span class= "ital">genesis </span>of Isaiah’s thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">assassins. </span>The word implies not casual homicide, but something like the choice of murder and robbery as a profession. Hosea (<a href="/hosea/6-9.htm" title="And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.">Hosea 6:9</a>) had painted a like picture as true of Samaria.

Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire.

It indicates that that had occurred which was matter of grief. The prophet had stated the principles of the divine government; had urged the people to reason with God; and had affirmed his willingness to pardon. But it was seen that they would not repent. They were so wicked and perverse, that there was no hope of their reformation. His mind is full of this subject; he repeats the charge of their wickedness <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21-23</a>, and states what must be the consequences.<p>The faithful city - Jerusalem. It is represented here under the image of a wife - once faithful to her husband; once a devoted and attached partner. Jerusalem was thus once. In former days, it was the seat of the pure worship of God; the place where his praise was celebrated, and where his people came to offer sincere devotion. In the Scriptures, the church is often represented under the image of a wife, to denote the tenderness and sacredness of the union; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>.<p>An harlot - She has proved to be false, treacherous, unfaithful.

In this place it has the sense of abiding, remaining, continuing permanently. Jerusalem was the home of justice, where it found protection and safety.<p>Now murderers - By murderers here are meant probably unjust judges; people who did not regard the interests of the poor, the widow, and the orphan; and who therefore, by a strong expression, are characterized as murderers. They had displaced justice from its home; and had become the permanent inhabitants of the city; compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. faithful&#8212;as a wife (Isa 54:5; 62:5; Ho 2:19, 20).<p>harlot&#8212;(Eze 16:28-35).<p>righteousness lodged&#8212;(2Pe 3:13).<p>murderers&#8212;murderous oppressors, as the antithesis requires (see on [687]Isa 1:15; [688]1Jo 3:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">How, </span> a note of admiration at so strange, and sad, and sudden a change, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is the faithful city, </span> Jerusalem, which in the reign of former kings was faithful to God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">become an harlot</span> is filled with idolatry, which is commonly called whoredom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It was full of judgment; </span> judgment was duly and truly executed in all its courts.

It is not clear when the systematic perversion of justice by the rulers began. Perhaps it originated in the latter part of Uzziah's reign, when the royal authority was weakened by being divided between Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But now murderers</span> (see the last note on ver. 15). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Their self-righteousness, so far as it rested upon sacrifices and festal observances, was now put to shame, and the last inward bulwark of the sham holy nation was destroyed: "And if ye stretch out your hands, I hide my eyes from you; if ye make ever so much praying, I do not hear: your hands are full of blood." Their praying was also an abomination to God. Prayer is something common to man: it is the interpreter of religious feeling, which intervenes and mediates between God and man;<p>(Note: The primary idea of hithpallel and tephillah is not to be obtained from <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>, as Dietrich and Frst suppose, who make hithpallel equivalent to hithnappel, to throw one's self down; but from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm">1 Samuel 2:25</a>, "If a man sin against a man, the authorities right him" (&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;: it is quite a mistake to maintain that Elohim cannot have this meaning), i.e., they can set right the relation which he has disturbed. "But if one sin against Jehovah, who shall mediate for him (&#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, quis intercedat pro eo)?" We may see from this that prayer is regarded as mediation, which sets right and establishes fellowship; and hithpallel signifies to make one's self a healer of divisions, or to settle for one's self, to strive after a settlement (sibi, pro se, intercedere: cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a>, hithchannen, sibi propitium facere; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, hithchakkah, sibi insculpere, like the Arabic ichtatta, to bound off for one's self).)<p>it is the true spiritual sacrifice. The law contains no command to pray, and, with the exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26.htm">Deuteronomy 26</a>, no form of prayer. Praying is so natural to man as man, that there was no necessity for any precept to enforce this, the fundamental expression of the true relation to God. The prophet therefore comes to prayer last of all, so as to trace back their sham-holiness, which was corrupt even to this the last foundation, to its real nothingness. "Spread out," parash, or pi pe&#772;re&#772;sh, to stretch out; used with Cappaim to denote swimming in <a href="/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a>. It is written here before a strong suffix, as in many other passages, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>, with the inflection i instead of e. This was the gesture of a man in prayer, who spread out his hands, and when spread out, stretched them towards heaven, or to the most holy place in the temple, and indeed (as if with the feeling of emptiness and need, and with a desire to receive divine gifts) held up the hollow or palm of his hand (Cappaim: cf., tendere palmas, e.g., Virg. Aen. xii. 196, tenditque ad sidera palmas). However much they might stand or lie before Him in the attitude of prayer, Jehovah hid His eyes, i.e., His omniscience knew nothing of it; and even though they might pray loud and long (gam chi, etiamsi: compare the simple Chi, <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>), He was, as it were, deaf to it all. We should expect Chi here to introduce the explanation; but the more excited the speaker, the shorter and more unconnected his words. The plural damim always denotes human blood as the result of some unnatural act, and then the bloody deed and the bloodguiltiness itself. The plural number neither refers to the quantity nor to the separate drops, but is the plural of production, which Dietrich has so elaborately discussed in his Abhandlung, p. 40.<p>(Note: As Chittah signified corn standing in the field, and Chittim corn threshed and brought to the market, so damim was not blood when flowing through the veins, but when it had flowed out-in other words, when it had been violently shed. (For the Talmudic misinterpretation of the true state of the case, see my Genesis, p. 626.))<p>The terrible damim stands very emphatically before the governing verb, pointing to many murderous acts that had been committed, and deeds of violence akin to murder. Not, indeed, that we are to understand the words as meaning that there was really blood upon their hands when they stretched them out in prayer; but before God, from whom no outward show can hide the true nature of things, however clean they might have washed themselves, they still dripped with blood. The expostulations of the people against the divine accusations have thus been negatively set forth and met in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a> : Jehovah could not endure their work-righteous worship, which was thus defiled with unrighteous works, even to murder itself. The divine accusation is now positively established in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, by the contrast drawn between the true righteousness of which the accused were destitute, and the false righteousness of which they boasted. The crushing charge is here changed into an admonitory appeal; and the love which is hidden behind the wrath, and would gladly break through, already begins to disclose itself. There are eight admonitions. The first three point to the removal of evil; the other five to the performance of what is good. </body></html>
