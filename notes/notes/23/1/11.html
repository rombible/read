This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To what purpose - &#1500;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1492;  la&#770;ma&#770;h l&#305;&#770;y. 'What is it to me; or what profit or pleasure can I have in them?' God here replies to an objection which might be urged by the Jews to the representation which had been made of their guilt. The objection would be, that they were strict in the duties of their religion, and that they even abounded in offering victims of sacrifice. God replies in this and the following verses, that all this would be of no use, and would meet with no acceptance, unless it were the offering of the heart. He demanded righteousness; and without that, all external offerings would be vain. The same sentiment often occurs in the Old Testament.<p>Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices<p>As in obeying the voice of the Lord?<p>Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,<p>And to hearken than the fat of rams.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

"Thinkest thou that I will eat the flesh of bulls, and drink the blood of goats? "(Psalm 1:13). God "delights not in burnt offerings." From the time of Samuel he had declared, "Behold, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David had said of him, "Sacrifice and meat offering thou wouldest not; burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required" (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8, 9</a>); and again, "I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, because they were not always before me. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy folds; for all the beasts of the forest are mine, and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills" (<a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-10</a>). Not, of course, that either David or Isaiah desired to abolish sacrifice, or had any commission so to do; but they were, both of them, anxious to impress on men that sacrifice, <span class="accented">by itself</span>, was nothing - that self-dedication, self-renunciation, true devotion of the heart, with its necessary concomitant obedience, must accompany sacrifice, for God to be pleased therewith. The sacrifices of a people such as is described in vers. 21-23 could not but be an offence to him. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> The phrase employed is unusual, and almost confined to Isaiah, occurring elsewhere only in <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>. Isaiah uses it again in ver. 18, and also in <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>; and Isaiah 66:9. It is explained to be emphatic, implying that this is what God says, and will say,  concerning the matter in hand, once and forever (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">I am full of the burnt offerings of rams</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I am overfull</span>, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, <span class="accented">wearied with them</span>. Barns formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (<a href="/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>), at the Feast of Weeks (<a href="/numbers/28-27.htm">Numbers 28:27</a>), at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36</a>), at the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2</a>), and on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="/numbers/29-8.htm">Numbers 29:8</a>). They were commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (<a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16, 18</a>). Under David were offered on one occasion "a thousand rams" (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-21.htm">1 Chronicles 29:21</a>); and the occasions where seven rams formed the legitimate sacrifice were many. Unaccompanied by a proper frame of mind, each such offering was an offence to God, displeased him, wearied him. <span class="cmt_word">The fat of fed beasts.</span> The fat was always regarded, both by the Hebrews and the Greeks, as especially suitable for sacrifice. It was burnt upon the altar in every case, even where the greater part of the victim was consumed as food (see <a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8, 12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3, 10</a>, etc.; note particularly the expression in <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>, "All the fat is the Lord's"). "Fed beasts" are those which were kept separate in stalls or sheds for some time before the sacrifice, and given food in which there was nothing" unclean." The Paschal lambs were required to be thus separated and fed for four days (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I delight not in the blood.</span> The blood, "which is the life" (<a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>), was to be sprinkled on the altar in every sacrifice of a victim. This sprinkling was of the very essence of the sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6, 17, 25, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Bullocks... lambs... he-goats.</span> These, together with rams, constituted all the sacrificial beasts of the Hebrews. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this v. a disputed question arises as to the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; (&#1502;&#1492;, the shorter, sharper form of &#1502;&#1492;, which is common even before non-gutturals, Ges. 32, 1): viz., whether they mean "wherefore," as the lxx, Targums, Vulgate, and most of the early versions render them, or "upon what," i.e., upon which part of the body, as others, including Schrring, suppose. Luzzatto maintains that the latter rendering is spiritless, more especially because there is nothing in the fact that a limb has been struck already to prevent its being struck again; but such objections as these can only arise in connection with a purely literal interpretation of the passage. If we adopted this rendering, the real meaning would be, that there was no judgment whatever that had not already fallen upon Israel on account of its apostasy, so that it was not far from utter destruction. We agree, however, with Caspari in deciding in favour of the meaning "to what" (to what end). For in all the other passage in which the expression occurs (fourteen times in all), it is used in this sense, and once even with the verb hicca&#770;h, to smite (<a href="/numbers/22-32.htm">Numbers 22:32</a>), whilst it is only in <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a> that the idea of the people as one body is introduced; whereas the question "upon what" would require that the reader or hearer should presuppose it here. But in adopting the rendering "whereto," or to what end, we do not understand it, as Malbim does, in the sense of Cui bono, with the underlying thought, "It would be ineffectual, as all the previous smiting has proved;" for this thought never comes out in a direct expression, as we should expect, but rather - according to the analogy of the questions with lamah in <a href="/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a> -in the sense of qua de causa, with the underlying thought, "There would be only an infatuated pleasure in your own destruction." <p><a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a> we therefore render thus: "Why would ye be perpetually smitten, multiplying rebellion?" &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; (with tiphchah, a stronger disjunctive than tebir) belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;; see the same form of accentuation in <a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a>. They are not two distinct interrogative clauses ("why would ye be smitten afresh? why do ye add revolt?" (Luzzatto), but the second clause is subordinate to the first (without there being any necessity to supply Chi, "because," as Gesenius supposes), an adverbial minor clause defining the main clause more precisely; at all events this is the logical connection, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a> (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>, "delighting in lies," and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, "loving vanity"): lxx "adding iniquity." Sa&#770;ra&#770;h (rebellion) is a deviation from truth and rectitude; and here, as in many other instances, it denotes apostasy from Jehovah, who is the absolutely Good, and absolute goodness. There is a still further dispute whether the next words should be rendered "every head" and "every heart," or "the whole head" and "the whole heart." In prose the latter would be impossible, as the two nouns are written without the article; but in the poetic style of the prophets the article may be omitted after Col, when used in the sense of "the whole" (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a> : with whole mouth, i.e., with full mouth). Nevertheless Col, without the article following, never signifies "the whole" when it occurs several times in succession, as in <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17-18</a>. We must therefore render <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>, "Every head is diseased, and every heart is sick." The Lamed in locholi indicates the state into which a thing has come: every head in a state of disease (Ewald, 217, d: locholi without the article, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-18.htm">2 Chronicles 21:18</a>). The prophet asks his fellow-countrymen why they are so foolish as to heap apostasy upon apostasy, and so continue to call down the judgments of God, which have already fallen upon them blow after blow. Has it reached such a height with them, that among all the many heads and hearts there is not one head which is not in a diseased state, not one heart which is not thoroughly ill? (davvai an emphatic form of daveh). Head and heart are mentioned as the noblest parts of the outer and inner man. Outwardly and inwardly every individual in the nation had already been smitten by the wrath of God, so that they had had enough, and might have been brought to reflection. </body></html>
