This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bring no more - God does not intend absolutely to forbid this kind of worship, but he expresses his strong abhorrence of the manner in which it was done. He desired a better state of mind; he preferred purity of heart to all this external homage.<p>Vain - Hebrew "offering of vanity" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  sha&#770;v' - offerings which were hollow, false, deceitful, and hypocritical.<p>Oblations - &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  minchath. This word properly denotes a gift, or present, of any kind <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>, and then especially a present or offering to the Deity, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3-5</a>. It does not denote a bloody offering, but what is improperly rendered in the Old Testament, a meat-offering <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a> - an offering made of flour or fruits, with oil and frankincense. A small part of it was burned upon the altar, and the remainder was eaten by Aaron and his sons with salt, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>. The proper translation would have been meat or flour-offering rather than meat-offering, since the word meat with us now denotes animal food only.<p>Incense - More properly frankincense. This is an aromatic or odoriferous gum, which is obtained from a tree called Thurifera. Its leaves were like those of a pear-tree. It grew around Mount Lebanon, and in Arabia. The gum was obtained by making incisions in the bark in dogdays. It was much used in worship, not only by the Jews, but by the pagan. When burned, it produced an agreeable odor; and hence, it is called a sacrifice of sweet smell, an odor acceptable to God; compare <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>. That which was burned among the Jews was prepared in a special manner, with a mixture of sweet spices. It was offered by the priest alone, and it was not lawful to prepare it in any other way than that prescribed by the law: see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>, ...<p>Is an abomination - Is hateful, or an object of abhorrence; that is, as it was offered by them, with hollow service, and with hypocritical hearts.<p>The new moons - On the appearance of the new moon. in addition to the daily sacrifices, two bullocks, a ram, and seven sheep, with a meal-offering, were required to be offered to God, <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-14</a>. The new moon in the beginning of the month Tisri (October), was the beginning of their civil year, and was commanded to be observed as a festival, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24-25</a>. The appearance of the new moon was announced by the blowing of silver trumpets, <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>. Hence, the annual festival was called sometimes, 'the memorial of the blowing of trumpets.' The time of the appearance of the new moon was not ascertained, as with us, by astronomical calculation; but persons were stationed, about the time it was to appear, on elevated places in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and when it was discovered, the trumpet was sounded. Moses did not command that this should be observed as a festival except at the beginning of the year, but it is not improbable that the Jews observed each return of the new moon as such.<p>And sabbaths - &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;  shabba&#770;th, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;  sha&#770;bath, "to cease to do anything"; "to rest from labor." The words used here are all in the singular number, and should have been rendered 'the new moon, and the sabbath, and the calling of the assembly;' though used in a collective sense. The sabbaths here refer not only to the weekly sabbaths, but to all their days of rest. The word sabbath means properly a day of rest <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; and it was applied not only to the seventh day, but particularly to the beginning and the close of their great festivals, which were days of unusual solemnity and sacredness, <a href="/leviticus/16-31.htm">Leviticus 16:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24-39</a>.<p>The calling of assemblies - The solemn convocations or meetings at their festivals and fasts.<p>I cannot away with - Hebrew &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;  lo' 'u&#770;kal - I cannot bear, or endure.<p>It is iniquity - That is, in the way in which it is conducted. This is a strong emphatic expression. It is not merely evil, and tending to evil; but it is iniquity itself. There was no mixture of good.<p>Even the solemn meeting - The word which is used here - &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ra&#770;h - comes from the verb &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;  &#8219;a&#770;tsar, which signifies to shut up, or to close; and is applied to the solemnities which concluded their great feasts, as being periods of unusual interest and sacredness. It was applied to such solemnities, because they shut up, or closed the sacred festivals. Hence, that day was called the great day of the feast, as being a day of special solemnity and impressiveness; see the note at <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3-36</a>. In the translation of this word, however, there is a great variety in the ancient versions. Vulgate, 'Your assemblies are iniquitous.' Septuagint, 'Your new moons, and sabbaths, and great day, I cannot endure; fasting and idleness.' Chald. Paraph., 'Sacrifice is abominable before me; and your new moons, and sabbaths, "since you will not forsake your sins, so that your prayer may be heard in the time of your assembling." Syriac, 'In the beginning of your months, and on the sabbath, you convene an assembly, but I do not eat that (that is, sacrifices) which has been Obtained by fraud and violence.' The English translation has, however, probably expressed the correct sense of the Hebrew. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. oblations&#8212;unbloody; "meat (old English sense, not flesh) offerings," that is, of flour, fruits, oil, &c.

But incense symbolized prayer (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>); and if no heartfelt prayer accompanied its use, it was emptied of all its significance, and became hateful to God - a <span class="accented">mere</span> form, and consequently an "abomination." <span class="cmt_word">The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with</span>. The weekly festival of the sabbath, the monthly one of the "new moon, "and the annual "assemblies" or "solemn feasts" (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>), were the main occasions of Jewish worship. As at this time conducted, God could endure none of them; all were tainted with the prevalent unreality. The construction of the passage is highly rhetorical, and indicates great excitement of feeling. Kay translates it literally, "New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot - it is ungodliness - even the solemn meeting." The authors of the Revised Version also suppose an aposiopesis. <span class="cmt_word">The solemn meeting.</span> The word thus translated is applied only to particular days in the great festival seasons, as to the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>), and the seventh day of the Passover (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a>), or else to days specially appointed for religious services by civil authority (<a href="/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-9.htm">2 Chronicles 7:9</a>; <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>). The meaning thus is, that <span class="accented">even the very highest</span> 'occasions of religious worship were abused by the Israelites of the time, and made an offence to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This is described more particularly in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>, which commences with the most general view, and returns to it again at the close."Your land ... a desert; your cities ... burned with fire; your field ... foreigners consuming it before your eyes, and a desert like overthrowing by strangers." Caspari has pointed out, in his Introduction to the Book of Isaiah, how nearly every word corresponds to the curses threatened in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> (29); <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-13.htm">Micah 6:13-16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>. stand in the very same relation to these sections of the Pentateuch. From the time of Isaiah downwards, the state of Israel was a perfect realization of the curses of the law. The prophet intentionally employs the words of the law to describe his own times; he designates the enemy, who devastated the land, reduced its towers to ashes, and took possession of its crops, by the simple term zarim, foreigners or barbarians (a word which would have the very same meaning if it were really the reduplication of the Aramaean bar; compare the Syriac baro&#772;ye, a foreigner), without mentioning their particular nationality. He abstracts himself from the definite historical present, in order that he may point out all the more emphatically how thoroughly it bears the character of the fore-ordained curse. The most emphatic indication of this was to be found in the fact, which the clause at the close of <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> palindromically affirms, that a desolation had been brought about "like the overthrow of foreigners." The repetition of a catchword like zarim (foreigners) at the close of the v. in this emphatic manner, is a figure of speech, called epanaphora, peculiar to the two halves of our collection. The question arises, however, whether zarim is to be regarded as the genitive of the subject, as Caspari, Knobel, and others suppose, "such an overthrow as is commonly produced by barbarians" (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>, where the verb occurs), or as the genitive of the object, "such an overthrow as comes upon barbarians." As mahpecha&#770;h (overthrow) is used in other places in which it occurs to denote the destruction of Sodom, Gomorrah, etc., according to the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, and Isaiah had evidently also this catastrophe in his mind, as <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a> clearly shows; we decide in favour of the conclusion that za&#770;rim is the genitive of the object (cf., <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>). The force of the comparison is also more obvious, if we understand the words in this sense. The desolation which had fallen upon the land of the people of God resembled that thorough desolation (subversio) with which God visited the nations outside the covenant, who, like the people of the Pentapolis, were swept from off the earth without leaving a trace behind. But although there was similarity, there was not sameness, as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> distinctly affirm. Jerusalem itself was still preserved; but in how pitiable a condition! There can be no doubt that bath-Zion ("daughter of Zion," Eng. ver.) in <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a> signifies Jerusalem. The genitive in this case is a genitive of apposition: "daughter Zion," not "daughter of Zion" (cf., <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a> : see Ges. 116, 5). Zion itself is represented as a daughter, i.e., as a woman. The expression applied primarily to the community dwelling around the fortress of Zion, to which the individual inhabitants stood in the same relation as children to a mother, inasmuch as the community sees its members for the time being come into existence and grow: they are born within her, and, as it were, born and brought up by her. It was then applied secondarily to the city itself, with or without the inhabitants (cf., <a href="/jeremiah/46-19.htm">Jeremiah 46:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>). In this instance the latter are included, as <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> clearly shows. This is precisely the point in the first two comparisons. </body></html>
