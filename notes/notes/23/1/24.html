Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore saith the Lord ... - The prophet having stated the guilt of the nation, proceeds to show the consequences of their crimes; or to foretell what would happen. The name of God is repeated, to attract attention; to fill the mind with awe; and to give emphasis to the solemn sentence which was about to be uttered.<p>The Lord - &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;  'a&#770;do&#770;n. This word properly denotes master, lord, owner. <a href="/genesis/24-9.htm">Genesis 24:9</a> : "lord over his whole house." <a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a> : "owner of the hill Samaria." It is applied here to Yahweh, not as a special title, or as one of the names which he assumes to himself, but as owner, proprietor, master, ruler of the nation. The word, when applied to God as one of his special titles, has the form of an ancient plural termination, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#774;dona&#772;y. The root is probably &#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;  do&#770;n, to judge, which in ancient times was also closely connected with the idea of ruling.<p>The Lord of hosts - Yahweh - ruling in the hosts of heaven, and therefore able to accomplish his threatenings; note, <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>.<p>The mighty One of Israel - He who had been their defender in the days of their peril; who had manifested his mighty power in overthrowing their enemies; and who had shown, therefore, that he was able to inflict vengeance on them.<p>Ah - &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;  ho&#770;y. This is an expression of threatening. It is that which is used when an affront is offered, and there is a purpose of revenge; see <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>.<p>I will ease me - This refers to what is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>, where God is represented as burdened with their crimes. The Hebrew word is, I will be consoled, or comforted - that is, by being delivered from my foes - &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501;  'ena&#770;chem from &#1504;&#1495;&#1501;  na&#770;cham, in Niphil, to suffer pain, to be grieved; and hence, to have pity, to show compassion. In Piel, to console or comfort one's-self; to take revenge. The idea included in the word is that of grief or distress, either in beholding the sufferings of others, or from some injury received from others. Hence, in Piel, it denotes to obtain relief from that distress, either by aiding the distressed object, or by taking revenge. In both instances, the mind, by a law of its nature, finds relief. The passion expends itself on its proper object, and the mind is at ease. It is used here in the latter sense. It is an instance where God uses the language which people employ to denote passion, and where they obtain relief by revenge. When applied to God, it is to be understood in accordance with his nature, as implying simply, that he would punish them; compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. It means that he had been pained and grieved by their crimes; his patience had been put to its utmost trial; and now he would seek relief from this by inflicting due punishment on them. An expression explaining this may be seen in <a href="/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>; 'Then shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted.' Also, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a> : 'As the Lord rejoiced over you, to do you good; so the Lord will rejoice over you, to destroy you.'<p>Mine adversaries - The enemies to his law and government among the rebellious Jews. The expression in this verse is a remarkable instance of God's adapting himself to our apprehension, by using our language. Instances occur often in the Scriptures where language expressive of human passions is applied to God; and as human language must be employed in revelation, it was indispensable. But those expressions are not to be understood as they are when applied to the passions of mankind. In God, they are consistent with all that is pure, and glorious, and holy, and should be so understood. The Chaldee renders this verse, 'I will console the city of Jerusalem; but woe to the impious, when I shall be revealed to take vengeance on the enemies of my people.' But this is manifestly a false interpretation; and shows how reluctant the Jews were to admit the threatenings against themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

It is foreknown to God that Israel will not repent. He therefore fulminates his judgment; which, however, is still conditional, so far as individuals are con-corned. His vengeance will fall upon the land; but the result will be twofold. Destruction will come upon the unrighteous and the sinners (ver. 28) - they will be "consumed" (ver. 28), and "confounded" (ver. 29); but there will be some on whom the punishment will have a purifying power, whose dross it will purge away, and whom it will convert to God (vers. 25, 27). From these will rise up a new Jerusalem - a "city of righteousness," a "faithful stronghold" (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, the Lord of hosts</span>.

Hitherto Jehovah has spoken to His people in wrath. But His love began to move even in the admonitions in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>. And now this love, which desired not Israel's destruction, but Israel's inward and outward salvation, breaks fully through. "O come, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah. If your sins come forth like scarlet cloth, they shall become white as snow; if they are red as crimson, they shall come forth like wool!" Jehovah here challenges Israel to a formal trial: nocach is thus used in a reciprocal sense, and with the same meaning as nishpat in <a href="/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a> (Ges. 51, 2). In such a trial Israel must lose, for Israel's self-righteousness rests upon sham righteousness; and this sham righteousness, when rightly examined, is but unrighteousness dripping with blood. It is taken for granted that this must be the result of the investigation. Israel is therefore worthy of death. Yet Jehovah will not treat Israel according to His retributive justice, but according to His free compassion. He will remit the punishment, and not only regard the sin as not existing, but change it into its very opposite. The reddest possible sin shall become, through His mercy, the purest white. On the two hiphils here applied to colour, see Ges. 53, 2; though he gives the meaning incorrectly, viz., "to take a colour," whereas the words signify rather to emit a colour: not Colorem accipere, but Colorem dare. Sha&#770;ni, bright red (the plural sha&#770;nim, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21</a>, signifies materials dyed with sha&#770;ni), and tola&#770;, warm colour, are simply different names for the same colour, viz., the crimson obtained from the cochineal insect, Color cocccineus. The representation of the work of grace promised by God as a change from red to white, is founded upon the symbolism of colours, quite as much as when the saints in the Revelation (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>) are described as clothed in white raiment, whilst the clothing of Babylon is purple and scarlet (<a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>). Red is the colour of fire, and therefore of life: the blood is red because life is a fiery process. For this reason the heifer, from which the ashes of purification were obtained for those who had been defiled through contact with the dead, was to be red; and the sprinkling-brush, with which the unclean were sprinkled, was to be tied round with a band of scarlet wool. But red as contrasted with white, the colour of light (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>), is the colour of selfish, covetous, passionate life, which is self-seeking in its nature, which goes out of itself only to destroy, and drives about with wild tempestuous violence: it is therefore the colour of wrath and sin. It is generally supposed that Isaiah speaks of red as the colour of sin, because sin ends in murder; and this is not really wrong, though it is too restricted. Sin is called red, inasmuch as it is a burning heat which consumes a man, and when it breaks forth consumes his fellow-man as well. According to the biblical view, throughout, sin stands in the same relation to what is well-pleasing to God, and wrath in the same relation to love or grace, as fire to light; and therefore as red to white, or black to white, for red and black are colours which border upon one another. In the Song of Solomon (<a href="/isaiah/7-5.htm">Isaiah 7:5</a>), the black locks of Shulamith are described as being "like purple," and Homer applies the same epithet to the dark waves of the sea. But the ground of this relation lies deeper still. Red is the colour of fire, which flashes out of darkness and returns to it again; whereas white without any admixture of darkness represents the pure, absolute triumph of light. It is a deeply significant symbol of the act of justification. Jehovah offers to Israel an actio forensis, out of which it shall come forth justified by grace, although it has merited death on account of its sins. The righteousness, white as snow and wool, with which Israel comes forth, is a gift conferred upon it out of pure compassion, without being conditional upon any legal performance whatever. </body></html>
