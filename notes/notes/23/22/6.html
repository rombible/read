Elam, or Persia, was at this time subject to Assyria, and their forces were united doubtless in the invasion of Judea.<p>Bare the quiver - A 'quiver' is a case in which arrows are carried. This was usually hung upon the shoulders, and thus "borne" by the soldier when he entered into battle. By the expression here, is meant that Elam was engaged in the siege, and was distinguished particularly for skill in shooting arrows. That the Elamites were thus distinguished for the use of the bow, is apparent from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>.<p>With chariots of men and horsemen - Lowth proposes, instead of 'men,' to read &#1488;&#1512;&#1501;  'a&#774;ra&#770;m, "Syria," instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;  'a&#770;da&#770;m, "man," by the change of the single Hebrew letter &#1491;  (d) into the Hebrew letter &#1512;  (r). This mistake might have been easily made where the letters are so much alike, and it would suit the parallelism of the passage, but there is no authority of MSS. or versions for the change. The words 'chariots of men - horsemen,' I understand here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>, to mean "a troop or riding" of men who were horsemen. Archers often rode in this manner. The Scythians usually fought on horseback with bows and arrows.<p>Kir - Kir was a city of Media, where the river Kyrus or Cyrus flows <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>; <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>. This was evidently then connected with the Assyrian monarchy, and was engaged with it in the invasion of Judea. Perhaps the name ''Kir' was given to a region or province lying on the river Cyrus or Kyrus. This river unites with the Araxes, and falls into the Caspian Sea.<p>Uncovered the shield - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>). Shields were protected during a march, or when not in use, by a covering of cloth. Among the Greeks, the name of this covering was &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  Sagma. Shields were made either of metal or of skin, and the object in covering them was to preserve the metal untarnished, or to keep the shield from injury. To "uncover the shield," therefore, was to prepare for battle. The Medes were subject to the Assyrians in the time of Hezekiah <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, and of course in the time of the invasion of Judea by Sennacherib. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

In Sennacherib's time, Elam was subject to Assyria (2Ki 18:11), and so furnished a contingent to its invading armies. Famed for the bow (Isa 13:18; Jer 49:35), in which the Ethiopians alone excelled them.<p>with chariots of men and horsemen&#8212;that is, they used the bow both in chariots and on horseback.

Elam, the country extending from the Zagros range to the Lower Tigris, and watered by the Choaspes, Eulaeus, Pasitigris, and other rivers, was an independent kingdom from a very early date (<a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1, 9</a>), and in Isaiah's time was generally hostile to Assyria. Sargon, however, relates that he conquered a portion of the country, planted colonies in it from the more western parts of his empire, and placed both colonists and natives under the governor of Babylon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 16). It is thus quite possible that both Sargon and Sennacherib may have had a contingent of Elamites in their armies. <span class="cmt_word">With chariots of men and horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with troops of men</span> (<span class="accented">who were</span>) <span class="accented">horsemen</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>). Kir uncovered the shield. "Kir" is mentioned in 2 Kings as the place to which Tiglath-Pileser transported the inhabitants of Damascus (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>), and by Amos (<a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>) as the original country from which the Syrians were derived. It has been recently identified with Kirkhi, near Diarbekr, or with Kirruri, in the Urumiyah country (Cheyne); but neither identification is marc than possible. (On uncovering shields as a preliminary to engaging in battle, see Caesar, 'Do Bell. Gall.,' 2:21.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus does the approaching fate of Arabia present itself in picture before the prophet's eye, whilst it is more distinctly revealed in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a> : "For thus hath the Lord spoken to me, Within a year, as the years of a hired labourer, it is over with all the glory of Kedar. And the remnant of the number of bows of heroes of the Kedarenes will be small: for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken." The name Kedar is here the collective name of the Arabic tribes generally. In the stricter sense, Kedar, like Nebaioth, which is associated with it, as a nomadic tribe of Ishmaelites, which wandered as far as the Elanitic Gulf. Within the space of a year, measured as exactly as is generally the case where employers and labourers are concerned, Kedar's freedom, military strength, numbers, and wealth (all these together constituting its glory), would all have disappeared. Nothing but a small remnant would be left of the heroic sons of Kedar and their bows. They are numbered here by their bows (in distinction from the numbering by heads), showing that the righting men are referred to - a mode of numbering which is customary among the Indian tribes of America, for example.<p>(Note: See the work of V. Martius on the Indians of Brazil, i. 395, 411, etc.)<p>The noun she'a&#770;r (remnant) is followed by five genitives here (just as peri is by four in <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>); and the predicate &#1497;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; is in the plural because of the copiousness of the subject. The period of the fulfilment of the prophecy keeps us still within the Assyrian era. In Herodotus (2, 141), Sennacherib is actually called "king of Arabians and Assyrians" (compare Josephus, Ant. x. 1, 4); and both Sargon and Sennacherib, in their annalistic inscriptions, take credit to themselves for the subjugation of Arabian tribes. But in the Chaldean era Jeremiah predicted the same things against Kedar (chapter 49) as against Edom; and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-30.htm">Jeremiah 49:30-31</a> was evidently written with a retrospective allusion to this oracle of Isaiah. When the period fixed by Isaiah for the fulfilment arrived, a second period grew out of it, and one still more remote, inasmuch as a second empire, viz., the Chaldean, grew out of the Assyrian, and inaugurated a second period of judgment for the nations. After a short glimmer of morning, the night set in a second time upon Edom, and a second time upon Arabia. </body></html>
