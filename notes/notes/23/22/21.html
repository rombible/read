What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will clothe him with thy robe - He shall succeed thee in the office, and wear the garments which are appropriate to it.<p>And strengthen him with thy girdle - That is, he shall wear the same girdle that thou didst (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>).

The same he wore, or rather one like unto it, which was a badge and token of his office. If he was a priest, as the Jews say, this was his priestly robe, by which the high priest was distinguished from others; but he rather seems to be a civil officer, who wore a garment suitable to it, and distinctive of it; in which he was a type of Christ, invested with the priestly, or rather with the kingly office, crowned with glory and honour; and who is seen among his churches, clothed with a garment down to the feet, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <p>and strengthen him with thy girdle: which was a symbol both of power and of strength; both priests and princes had their girdles.

The word for “girdle” is used elsewhere only of the priestly girdle (see <a href="/exodus/39-29.htm" title="And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:29</a>, &c.).

The dress of office worn by Shebna would be taken from him, and Eliakim would be invested therewith. The "robe" is the long-sleeved cloak or tunic worn commonly by persons of rank; the "girdle" is probably an ornamental one, like those of the priests (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), worn over the inner tunic. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be a father</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a protector, counselor, guide (comp. <a href="/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a>, "I was <span class="accented">a father to the poor</span>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out"). It is, perhaps, implied that Shebna had not conducted himself as a "father." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thus spake the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee to that steward there, to Shebna the house-mayor. What has thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewn thyself out a sepulchre here, hewing out his sepulchre high up, digging himself a dwelling in rocks? Behold, Jehovah hurleth thee, hurling with a man's throw, and graspeth thee grasping. Coiling, He coileth thee a coil, a ball into a land far and wide; there shalt thou die, and thither the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of the house of thy lord! And I thrust thee from thy post, and from thy standing-place he pulleth thee down." &#1500;&#1498;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;, go, take thyself in - not into the house, however, but into the present halting-place. It is possible, at the same time, that the expression may simply mean "take thyself away," as in <a href="/genesis/45-17.htm">Genesis 45:17</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>. The preposition &#1488;&#1500; is interchanged with &#1506;&#1500;, which more commonly denotes the coming of a stronger man upon a weaker one (<a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>), and is here used to designate the overwhelming power of the prophet's word. "That steward there:" this expression points contemptuously to the position of the minister of the court as one which, however high, was a subordinate one after all. We feel at once, as we read this introduction to the divine address, that insatiable ambition was one of the leading traits in Shebna's character. What Isaiah is to say to Shebna follows somewhat abruptly. The words "and say to him," which are added in the Septuagint, naturally suggest themselves. The question, What hast thou to do here, and whom hast thou to bury here? is put with a glance at Shebna's approaching fate. This building of a sepulchre was quite unnecessary; Shebna himself would never lie there, nor would he be able to bury his relations there. The threefold repetition of the word "here" (poh) is of very incisive force: it is not here that he will stay - here, where he is even now placing himself on a bier, as if it were his home. The participles &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;&#1497; (with chirek compaginis: see on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-1.htm">Psalm 113:1-9</a>) are also part of the address. The third person which is introduced here is syntactically regular, although the second person is used as well (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2-3</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>). Rock-tombs, i.e., a collection of tombs in the form of chambers in the rocks, were indeed to be found to the east of Jerusalem, on the western slope of the Mount of Olives, and in the wall of rock to the west of Jerusalem; but the word ma&#770;rom ("high up"), in connection with the threefold "here" (poh), and the contemptuous "that administrator there," warrants us in assuming that ma&#770;rom refers to "the height of the sepulchres of the sons of David" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>), i.e., the eastern slope of Zion, where the tombs of the kings were excavated in the rocks. <p>So high did Shebna stand, and so great did he think himself, that he helped after his death to rest among kings, and by no means down at the bottom. But how he deceived himself! Jehovah would hurl him far away (tu&#772;l, to be long; pilpel, to throw or stretch out to a distance),<p>(Note: In the later form of the language, this verbal stem signifies generally to move onward; hence tiyyu&#772;l, motion, or a walk, and metaltel&#305;&#772;n, furniture, i.e., moveable goods.)<p>&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;. This is either equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1514; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, with a man's throw (Rosenmller), or &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is in apposition to Jehovah (Gesenius and Knobel). As talte&#772;lah stands too baldly if the latter be adopted, for which reason the vocative rendering "O man," which is found in the Syriac, does not commend itself, and as such an elliptical combination of the absolute with the genitive is by no means unusual (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>), we give the preference to the former. Jerome's rendering, "as they carry off a cock," which he obtained from the mouth of his Hebraeus, cannot be taken into consideration at all; although it has been retained by Schegg (see Geiger, Lesestcke aus der Mischna, p. 106). The verb &#1506;&#1496;&#1492; does not give a suitable sense as used in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-12.htm">Jeremiah 43:12</a>, where it merely signifies to cover one's self, not to wrap up; nor can we obtain one from <a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>, since the verbal forms which we find there, and which are to be traced to &#1506;&#1497;&#1496; (from which comes &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, a bird of prey), and not to &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;, signify "to rush upon anything" (when construed with either &#1489;&#1468; or &#1488;&#1500;). It is better, therefore, to take it, as Michaelis, Rosenmller, Knobel, and others do, in the sense of grasping or laying hold of. On the other hand, tza&#770;naph, which is applied in other instances to the twisting of a turban, also signifies to wrap up, make up into a bundle, or coil up. And caddu&#772;r, like tzene&#772;pha&#770;h, signifies that into which Shebna would be coiled up; for the Caph is not to be taken in a comparative sense, since the use of caddu&#772;r in the sense of globus or sphaera is established by the Talmud (see at <a href="/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>), whereas the Arabic daur only means gyrus, periodus. Shebna is made into a round coil, or ball, which is hurled into a land stretching out on both sides, i.e., over the broad surface of Mesopotamia, where he flies on farther and farther, without meeting with any obstacle whatever.<p>(Note: Compare the old saying, "The heart of man is an apple driven by a tempest over an open plain.")<p>He comes thither to die - he who, by his exaggeration and abuse of his position, has not only dishonoured his office, but the Davidic court as well; and thither do his state carriages also come. There can be no doubt that it was by the positive command of Jehovah that Isaiah apostrophized the proud and wealthy Shebna with such boldness and freedom as this. And such freedom was tolerated too. The murder or incarceration of a prophet was a thing of rare occurrence in the kingdom of Judah before the time of Manasseh. In order to pave the way for the institution of another in Shebna's office, the punishment of deposition, which cannot be understood in any other way than as preceding the punishment of banishment, is placed at the close of the first half of the prophecy. The subject in <a href="/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a> is not the king, as Luzzatto supposes, but Jehovah, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a> (compare <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>). </body></html>
