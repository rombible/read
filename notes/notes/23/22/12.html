Now also they discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works by presumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is a token that a man will perish wilfully.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in that day - In the invasion of Sennacherib.

It has been said that "baldness" was forbidden by the Law (Cheyne); but this is not so, absolutely. Baldness was wholly forbidden to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a>); and certain peculiar modes of shaving the hair, the beard, and the eyebrows, practiced by idolatrous nations, were prohibited to all the people (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). But such shaving of the head as was practiced by Job (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and other pious men, was not forbidden to laymen, any more than the wearing of sackcloth.

"And Elam has taken the quiver, together with chariots with men, horsemen; and Kir has drawn out the shield. And then it comes to pass, that thy choicest valleys are filled with chariots, and the horsemen plant a firm foot towards the gate." Of the nations composing the Assyrian army, the two mentioned are Elam, the Semitic nation of Susiana (Chuzistan), whose original settlements were the row of valleys between the Zagros chain and the chain of advanced mountains bounding the Assyrian plains on the east, and who were greatly dreaded as bowmen (<a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>), and Kir, the inhabitants of the country of the Cyrus river, which was an Assyrian province, according to <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>, and still retained its dependent position even in the time of the Achaemenides, when Armenia, at any rate, is expressly described in the arrowheaded writings as a Persian province, though a rebellious one. The readiness for battle of this people of Kur, who represent, in combination with Elam, the whole extent of the Assyrian empire from south to north,<p>(Note: The name Gurgistan ( equals  Georgia) has nothing to do with the river Kur; and it is a suspicious fact that Kir has k at the commencement, and i in the middle, whereas the name of the river which joins the Araxes, and flows into the Caspian sea, is pronounced Kur, and is written in Persian with k (answering to the Armenian and old Persian, in which Kuru is equivalent to &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). Wetzstein considers Kir a portion of Mesopotamia.)<p>is attested by their "drawing out the shield" (&#8219;e&#772;ra&#770;h ma&#770;ge&#772;n), which Caesar calls scutis tegimenta detrahere (bell. gall. ii. 21); for the Talmudic meaning applicare cannot be thought of for a moment (Buxtorf, lex. col. 1664). These nations that fought on foot were accompanied (Beth, as in <a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>) by chariots filled with men (receb 'a&#770;da&#770;m), i.e., war-chariots (as distinguished from &#8219;aga&#770;loth), and, as is added &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, by pa&#770;ra&#770;shim, riders (i.e., horsemen trained to arms). The historical tense is introduced with &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a>, but in a purely future sense. It is only for the sake of the favourite arrangement of the words that the passage does not proceed with Vav relat. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. "Thy valleys" (&#8219;ama&#770;kaik) are the valleys by which Jerusalem was encircled on the east, the west, and the south, viz., the valley of Kidron on the east; the valley of Gihon on the west; the valley of Rephaim, stretching away from the road to Bethlehem, on the south-west (<a href="/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>); the valley of Hinnom, which joins the Tyropaeum, and then runs on into a south-eastern angle; and possibly also the valley of Jehoshaphat, which ran on the north-east of the city above the valley of Kidron. These valleys, more especially the finest of them towards the south, are now cut up by the wheels and hoofs of the enemies' chariots and horses; and the enemies' horsemen have already taken a firm position gatewards, ready to ride full speed against the gates at a given signal, and force their way into the city (sh&#305;&#772;th with a shoth to strengthen it, as in <a href="/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; also s&#305;&#772;m in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-12.htm">1 Kings 20:12</a>, compare <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>). </body></html>
