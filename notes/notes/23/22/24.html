Not without a touch of irony, as the sequel shows, the prophet paints the extent to which those who belong to Eliakim will hang upon his support. There will be the “glory” or the “weight” (the Hebrew word has both meanings) of his next-of-kin. Besides these there will be the remoter <span class= "ital">off-shoots </span>and <span class= "ital">side-shoots </span>of his family. But the number will increase, and upon that single nail, or peg, would hang the “vessels of small quantity,” cups such as were used by the priests for the blood of the victims in sacrificing (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.">Exodus 24:6</a>), or for wine in common use (Song <a href="/songs/7-2.htm" title="Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>), flagons, or earthen pitchers, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>, i.e., the whole crowd of the retainers of a great official. The prophet obviously paints the picture as a warning. There was the danger even for Eliakim, upright and religious as he was, as there has been for others like him, of giving way to nepotism, and the fault would not remain unpunished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/22-24.htm" title="And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons....">Isaiah 22:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">They shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house </span>— Of his own kindred and family, who shall all depend upon him, and receive glory from him; <span class="ital">the offspring and the issue </span>— Great and small, the children and grand-children, of his father’s house. <span class="ital">All vessels of small</span> <span class="ital">quantity </span>— The meanest of them shall receive a lustre and advantage from their relation to him; <span class="ital">from the vessels of cups, </span>&c. — All sorts of vessels, great or small, mean or precious, may be hanged upon him, without any fear of falling. <span class="ital">In that day shall the nail, </span>&c. — This must be understood of Shebna, as a repetition and confirmation of the sentence above denounced against him; <span class="ital">shall the nail that is fastened </span>— That seemed to be so, both in his own eyes, and in the eyes of others; <span class="ital">be removed and fall</span> — As above described; <span class="ital">and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off </span>— All those wicked officers that were advanced and supported by his power. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they shall hang upon him - This figure is a continuation of that commenced in the previous verse; and is derived from the custom of "hanging" clothes or ornaments on the spikes that were fixed in the walls; and, perhaps, more particularly from the custom of suspending shields, swords, suits of armor, etc., taken in battle, around the walls of a temple. A great portion of the wealth of the ancients consisted in gold and silver vessels, and in changes of raiment. These would be hung around a house in no inconsiderable degree for ostentation and parade. 'Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold; and all the vessels of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver' <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>. 'The vessels in the house of the forest of Lebanon were two hundred targets and three hundred shields of beaten gold' <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>. That these were hung on spikes or pins around the house is apparent from Sol 4:4 : 'Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an armory, whereon there bans a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.' Eliakim is considered as a principal support like this, whereon would be suspended all the glory of his father's family, and all the honor of his house; that is, he would be the principal support of the whole civil and ecclesiastical polity.<p>The offspring and the issue - All that proceeded from the family; all that were connected with it. Kimchi and Aben Ezra render it, 'Sons and daughters.' The Septuagint: 'From the least to the greatest.' The Chaldee, 'Sons and grandsons, youth and children.' The idea is, that all the prosperity, near and remote, would depend on him; and that his character would sustain and give dignity to them all. The word which is rendered 'issue' (&#1492;&#1510;&#1508;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;  hatsepi&#8219;o&#770;t), according to Vitringa and Rosenmuller, denotes those that were of humble condition; and the passage means that honor would be conferred even on these by the virtues of Eliakim.<p>From the vessels of cups - literally, goblets, or bowls (&#1488;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;  'a&#772;ga&#770;no&#770;t). The idea probably is, simply that of vessels of "small capacity," whatever was the material of which they were composed; and hence, the reference here is to those of the family of Eliakim who were of humble rank, or who were poor.<p>To all the vessels of flagons - Margin, 'Instruments of viols.' Hebrew, &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  neba&#770;liym. This word is often applied to instruments of musica the &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  nebel, viol (see it described in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>); but it properly denotes a bottle made of skin for holding wine, and which, being made of the whole skin of a goat or sheep, indicated the vessels of large dimensions. Here it refers to the members of the family of Eliakim who were more wealthy and influential than those denoted by the small vessels. The glory of the whole family would depend on him. His virtues, wisdom, integrity, and valor in defending and saving the Hebrew commonwealth, would diffuse honor over the whole family connection, and render the name illustrious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The Targum is, <p>"from young men to little ones; from the priests clothed with the ephod, to the Levites that held the psalteries.'' <p>In the typical sense, it is to be understood of the vessels of mercy; some of which are larger, and others lesser; some capable of receiving more grace and larger gifts, and others less; to whom Christ communicates, and whom he fills, according to their capacities; all whose wants he supplies, and whose persons he supports; he fills them with his grace, and he fits them for glory; see <a href="/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.</span><p>(z) Meaning that both small and great who will come from Eliakim, will have praise and glory by his faithful officer.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

What has thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewn thyself out a sepulchre here, hewing out his sepulchre high up, digging himself a dwelling in rocks? Behold, Jehovah hurleth thee, hurling with a man's throw, and graspeth thee grasping. Coiling, He coileth thee a coil, a ball into a land far and wide; there shalt thou die, and thither the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of the house of thy lord! And I thrust thee from thy post, and from thy standing-place he pulleth thee down." &#1500;&#1498;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;, go, take thyself in - not into the house, however, but into the present halting-place. It is possible, at the same time, that the expression may simply mean "take thyself away," as in <a href="/genesis/45-17.htm">Genesis 45:17</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>. The preposition &#1488;&#1500; is interchanged with &#1506;&#1500;, which more commonly denotes the coming of a stronger man upon a weaker one (<a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>), and is here used to designate the overwhelming power of the prophet's word. "That steward there:" this expression points contemptuously to the position of the minister of the court as one which, however high, was a subordinate one after all. We feel at once, as we read this introduction to the divine address, that insatiable ambition was one of the leading traits in Shebna's character. What Isaiah is to say to Shebna follows somewhat abruptly. The words "and say to him," which are added in the Septuagint, naturally suggest themselves. The question, What hast thou to do here, and whom hast thou to bury here? is put with a glance at Shebna's approaching fate. This building of a sepulchre was quite unnecessary; Shebna himself would never lie there, nor would he be able to bury his relations there. The threefold repetition of the word "here" (poh) is of very incisive force: it is not here that he will stay - here, where he is even now placing himself on a bier, as if it were his home. The participles &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;&#1497; (with chirek compaginis: see on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-1.htm">Psalm 113:1-9</a>) are also part of the address. The third person which is introduced here is syntactically regular, although the second person is used as well (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2-3</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>). Rock-tombs, i.e., a collection of tombs in the form of chambers in the rocks, were indeed to be found to the east of Jerusalem, on the western slope of the Mount of Olives, and in the wall of rock to the west of Jerusalem; but the word ma&#770;rom ("high up"), in connection with the threefold "here" (poh), and the contemptuous "that administrator there," warrants us in assuming that ma&#770;rom refers to "the height of the sepulchres of the sons of David" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>), i.e., the eastern slope of Zion, where the tombs of the kings were excavated in the rocks. <p>So high did Shebna stand, and so great did he think himself, that he helped after his death to rest among kings, and by no means down at the bottom. But how he deceived himself! Jehovah would hurl him far away (tu&#772;l, to be long; pilpel, to throw or stretch out to a distance),<p>(Note: In the later form of the language, this verbal stem signifies generally to move onward; hence tiyyu&#772;l, motion, or a walk, and metaltel&#305;&#772;n, furniture, i.e., moveable goods.)<p>&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;. This is either equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1514; &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, with a man's throw (Rosenmller), or &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is in apposition to Jehovah (Gesenius and Knobel). As talte&#772;lah stands too baldly if the latter be adopted, for which reason the vocative rendering "O man," which is found in the Syriac, does not commend itself, and as such an elliptical combination of the absolute with the genitive is by no means unusual (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>), we give the preference to the former. Jerome's rendering, "as they carry off a cock," which he obtained from the mouth of his Hebraeus, cannot be taken into consideration at all; although it has been retained by Schegg (see Geiger, Lesestcke aus der Mischna, p. 106). The verb &#1506;&#1496;&#1492; does not give a suitable sense as used in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-12.htm">Jeremiah 43:12</a>, where it merely signifies to cover one's self, not to wrap up; nor can we obtain one from <a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>, since the verbal forms which we find there, and which are to be traced to &#1506;&#1497;&#1496; (from which comes &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, a bird of prey), and not to &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;, signify "to rush upon anything" (when construed with either &#1489;&#1468; or &#1488;&#1500;). It is better, therefore, to take it, as Michaelis, Rosenmller, Knobel, and others do, in the sense of grasping or laying hold of. On the other hand, tza&#770;naph, which is applied in other instances to the twisting of a turban, also signifies to wrap up, make up into a bundle, or coil up. And caddu&#772;r, like tzene&#772;pha&#770;h, signifies that into which Shebna would be coiled up; for the Caph is not to be taken in a comparative sense, since the use of caddu&#772;r in the sense of globus or sphaera is established by the Talmud (see at <a href="/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>), whereas the Arabic daur only means gyrus, periodus. Shebna is made into a round coil, or ball, which is hurled into a land stretching out on both sides, i.e., over the broad surface of Mesopotamia, where he flies on farther and farther, without meeting with any obstacle whatever.<p>(Note: Compare the old saying, "The heart of man is an apple driven by a tempest over an open plain.")<p>He comes thither to die - he who, by his exaggeration and abuse of his position, has not only dishonoured his office, but the Davidic court as well; and thither do his state carriages also come. There can be no doubt that it was by the positive command of Jehovah that Isaiah apostrophized the proud and wealthy Shebna with such boldness and freedom as this. And such freedom was tolerated too. The murder or incarceration of a prophet was a thing of rare occurrence in the kingdom of Judah before the time of Manasseh. In order to pave the way for the institution of another in Shebna's office, the punishment of deposition, which cannot be understood in any other way than as preceding the punishment of banishment, is placed at the close of the first half of the prophecy. The subject in <a href="/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a> is not the king, as Luzzatto supposes, but Jehovah, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a> (compare <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>). </body></html>
