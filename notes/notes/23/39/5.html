Now he begins to let him know that he came not of himself, and that he did not ask these questions to gratify his own curiosity, but that he came from the Lord, and with a word of rebuke from him: <p>hear the word of the Lord of hosts; a greater King than thou art, who art so elated with thy riches, and grandeur, and fame; or than the king of Babylon, whose ambassadors these are; even the King of kings, and Lord of armies above and below, and who is able to make good every word that is spoken by him, and therefore should be solemnly attended to. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Hear the word of the Lord</span>] Isaiah’s tone is threatening, because he sees in this thing a sin against Jehovah. It was not necessary to specify wherein the offence consisted; king and prophet understood each other perfectly. The reception of an embassy from the sworn enemy of the king of Assyria was in itself an act of rebellion likely to precipitate a conflict which Isaiah strove to avert; and the childish vanity displayed by Hezekiah, his pride in earthly resources, and his readiness to enter into friendly relations with the powers of this world, were tendencies against which Isaiah’s ministry had been a continuous protest. All these tendencies sprang from a single root, the lack of that absolute faith in Jehovah as the all-sufficient guide and protector of the nation which was the fundamental article of Isaiah’s political programme.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the Lord of hosts</span>. Either the prophet had been specially charged with a Divine message to  the king before he sought his presence, or the prophetic afflatus now came on him suddenly. The former is, on the whole, more probable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The text of Isaiah is not only curtailed here in a very forced manner, but it has got into confusion; for <a href="/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a> are removed entirely from their proper place, although even the Septuagint has them at the close of Hezekiah's psalm. They have been omitted from their place at the close of <a href="/isaiah/38-6.htm">Isaiah 38:6</a> through an oversight, and then added in the margin, where they now stand (probably with a sign, to indicate that they were supplied). We therefore insert them here, where they properly belong. "Then Isaiah said they were to bring (K. take) a fig-cake; and they plaistered (K. brought and covered) the boil, and he recovered. And Hizkiyahu said (K. to Isaiah), What sign is there that (K. Jehovah will heal me, so that I go up) I shall go up into the house of Jehovah?" As shech&#305;&#772;n never signifies a plague-spot, but an abscess (indicated by heightened temperature), more especially that of leprosy (cf., <a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-18.htm">Leviticus 13:18</a>), there is no satisfactory ground, as some suppose, for connecting Hezekiah's illness (taken along with <a href="/isaiah/33-24.htm">Isaiah 33:24</a>) with the pestilence which broke out in the Assyrian army. The use of the figs does not help us to decide whether we are to assume that it was a boil (bubon) or a carbuncle (charbon). Figs were a well-known emmoliens or maturans, and were used to accelerate the rising of the swelling and the subsequent discharge. Isaiah did not show any special medical skill by ordering a softened cake of pressed figs to be laid upon the boil, nor did he expect it to act as a specific, and effect a cure: it was merely intended to promote what had already been declared to be the will of God. &#1506;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is probably more original than the simpler but less definite &#1506;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;. Hitzig is wrong in rendering &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;, "that it (the boil) may get well;" and Knobel in rendering it, "that he may recover." It is merely the anticipation of the result so common in the historical writings of Scripture (see at <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>), after which the historian goes back a step or two. <p><a href="/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a>On <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a>, see the notes at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4-6</a>, where these two vv. belong. </body></html>
