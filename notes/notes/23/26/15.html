But the prophet perhaps foretels their increase after their return from captivity in Babylon; and, as some think, that increase of the church (called the righteous nation, <a href="/isaiah/26-2.htm" title="Open you the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.">Isaiah 26:2</a>) which was to take place in gospel days. <span class="ital">Thou art glorified </span>— In faithfully fulfilling thy promises made to Abraham concerning the multiplication of his seed, and making him <span class="ital">the father of many nations.

This was the case before, and at the time of the coming of the Messiah, and of the opening of the gospel dispensation, <a href="/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>. And in a little time, the Gentiles being called into the church of God, the Christians were spread over all parts of the Roman empire, and far beyond its utmost limits, and they were much more faithful witnesses or the truth than the Jews had ever been. But, as the Hebrew of the first clause of this verse, <span class="greekheb">יספת לגוי</span>, when literally rendered, is only, <span class="ital">thou hast added to the nation; </span>some think the prophet does not speak of adding to their number, or increasing them, but rather of adding to their plagues or chastisements. This, it must be acknowledged, would agree well with what follows. Then the interpretation of the next clauses would be, Thy justice is glorified in their punishment, and thou hast removed them out of their own land, and suffered them to be carried captive to the ends of the earth. This, as the reader will easily observe, would accord perfectly with what follows to the end of the chapter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-19 Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to our comfort, God makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed to make against us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast increased the nation - That is, the Jewish nation (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>). The nation was not only enlarged by its regular increase of population, but many converts attended them on their return from Babylon, and probably many came in from surrounding nations on the rebuilding of their capital.<p>Thou hadst removed it far ... - Or rather, thou hast extended far all the borders of the land. The word rendered 'removed' (&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;  ra&#770;chaq) means usually to put far away, and here it may mean to put far away the borders or boundaries of the nation; that is, to extend them far. The word 'unto' is not in the original; and the phrase rendered 'ends of the earth,' may mean the borders. or boundaries of the land. The parallelism requires this construction, and it is indeed the obvious one, and has been adopted by Lowth and Noyes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. hast&#8212;prophetical preterite (Isa 9:3).<p>hast removed &#8230; far &#8230; ends of &#8230; earth&#8212;rather, "Thou hast extended far all the borders of the land" [Vitringa].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast increased the nation, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">Thou hast added to the nation</span>; which may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It makes the redeemed pass in thought from their present state of happiness and glory to that former time of tribulation and affliction when they were a remnant, scattered over the face of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13-15</a>), driven into its uttermost corners (<a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>), oppressed and down-trodden by their enemies. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear the rendering. Most modern commentators translate, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> hast extended far all the borders of the land," which is certainly the more natural meaning of the words. If we accept this view, we must regard the clause as continuing the idea contained in the former part of the verse - the nation is increased in number, and its borders are advanced - it is "a multitude that no man can <span class="accented">number</span>," and it has no narrower limits than the "<span class="accented">new</span> earth," which has been given to it for its habitation (<a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It then commences again in a lyrical tone in <a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> : "We have also waited for Thee, that Thou shouldest come in the path of Thy judgments; the desire of the soul went after Thy name, and after Thy remembrance. With my soul I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit deep within me, I longed to have Thee here: for when Thy judgments strike the earth, the inhabitants of the earth learn righteousness." In the opinion of Hitzig, Knobel, Drechsler, and others, the prophet here comes back from the ideal to the actual present. But this is not the case. The church of the last days, looking back to the past, declares with what longing it has waited for that manifestation of the righteousness of God which has now taken place. "The path of Thy judgments:" 'orach mishpa&#770;te&#772;ka&#770; belongs to the te; venientem (or venturum) being understood. The clause follows the poetical construction &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, after the analogy of &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;. They longed for God to come as a Redeemer in the way of His judgments. The "name" and "remembrance" ad the nature of God, that has become nameable and memorable through self-assertion and self-manifestation (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). They desired that God should present Himself again to the consciousness and memory of man, by such an act as should break through His concealment and silence. The prophet says this more especially of himself; for he feels himself "in spirit" to be a member of the perfected church. "My soul" and "my spirit" are accusatives giving a more precise definition (Ewald, 281, c). "The night" is the night of affliction, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>. In connection with this, the word shiche&#772;r (lit. to dig for a thing, to seek it eagerly) is employed here, with a play upon shachar. The dawning of the morning after a night of suffering was the object for which he longed, naphshi (my soul), i.e., with his entire personality (Pyschol. p. 202), and ruchi b'kirbi (my spirit within me), i.e., with the spirit of his mind, &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Psychol. p. 183). And why? Because, as often as God manifested Himself in judgment, this brought men to the knowledge, and possibly also to the recognition, of what was right (cf., <a href="/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>). "Will learn:" la&#770;mdu is a praet. gnomicum, giving the result of much practical experience. </body></html>
