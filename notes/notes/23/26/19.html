Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy dead men shall live </span>— The prophet here, speaking in the name of God, turns his speech to God’s church, and gives her a cordial to support her in that deep distress which he had foretold she should suffer, and which is described in the preceding verse. Thy dead men are not like those mentioned <a href="/isaiah/26-14.htm" title="They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.">Isaiah 26:14</a>, for they shall not live, as was there said, but thine shall live. You shall certainly be delivered from all your fears and dangers. For here, as Bishop Lowth observes, “The deliverance of the people of God, from a state of the lowest depression, is explained by images taken from the resurrection of the dead.” And nothing is more frequent, both in Scripture and other authors, than for great calamities to be compared to death, and deliverance from them to <span class="ital">reviving, </span>a <span class="ital">resurrection, </span>and <span class="ital">life; </span>and particularly the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and their deliverance out of it, is largely expressed by this very similitude, <a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm" title="Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.">Ezekiel 37:11</a>, &c. “It appears from hence,” says Bishop Lowth, “that the doctrine of the resurrection was at that time a popular and common doctrine; for an image which is assumed, in order to express or represent any thing in the way of allegory, or metaphor, whether poetical or prophetical, must be an image commonly known and understood, otherwise it will not answer the purpose for which it is assumed.” <span class="ital">Together with my dead body shall they arise </span>— It is to be observed here, that the words, <span class="ital">together with, </span>are supplied by our translation, there being nothing for them in the Hebrew. “All the ancient versions,” says Bishop Lowth, “render the word in the plural; they read <span class="greekheb">נבלותי</span>, <span class="ital">my dead bodies.” </span>The Vulgate has it, <span class="ital">Interfecti mei resurgent, My slain men shall rise. </span>The Syriac and Chaldaic read, <span class="ital">their dead bodies; </span>and the LXX. <span class="greekheb">εγερθησονται οι εν τοις μνημειοις</span>, <span class="ital">those that are in their graves shall be raised. </span>It seems this clause is added merely as an amplification or repetition of the former, being entirely equivalent therewith, and expressing only that the Jewish Church, with which the prophet connects himself, as being a member of it, should be delivered out of captivity in Babylon, but not that he himself should either personally suffer in that captivity, or have a part in that deliverance. Thus, in a similar way, (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>,) the apostle connects himself with those that should be found alive at Christ’s second coming, <span class="ital">we who are alive, </span>&c., certainly not intending to signify that he personally should be alive at that time. <span class="ital">Awake, </span>&c. — Out of your sleep, even <span class="ital">the sleep of death, ye that dwell in </span>the <span class="ital">dust </span>— You that are dead and buried in the earth. <span class="ital">For thy dew </span>— The favour and blessing of God upon thee; <span class="ital">is as the dew of herbs </span>— Which refreshes and revives them, and makes them grow and flourish. <span class="ital">And the earth shall cast out the dead </span>— As an abortive birth is cast out of the womb, to which the grave is compared, <a href="/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a>. But, as the verb <span class="greekheb">תפיל</span>, here used, does not properly signify to <span class="ital">cast out, </span>but <span class="ital">to cast down, </span>or <span class="ital">cause to fall, </span>these words are by many, both ancient and later interpreters, rendered otherwise, namely, <span class="ital">thou wilt cast down, </span>or <span class="ital">she, </span>that is, the church, <span class="ital">shall cast down the land of the giants, </span>or <span class="ital">violent ones. </span>Thus the Vulgate: <span class="ital">Thou shalt draw into ruin the land of the giants; </span>and the LXX., <span class="greekheb">η δε γη των ασεβων πεσειται</span>, <span class="ital">the land of the ungodly shall fall, </span>or <span class="ital">be brought down. </span>The sense is, the church shall prevail against all oppressors, and shall cast them down: when brought low she shall rise, but her enemies shall not.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-19 Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to our comfort, God makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed to make against us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy dead men shall live - Very various interpretations have been given of this verse, which may be seen at length by comparing Vitringa, Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and Poole's Synopsis. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>, the chorus is represented as saying of the dead men and tyrants of Babylon that had oppressed the captive Jews, that they should not rise, and should no more oppress the people of God. In contradistinction from this fate of their enemies, the choir is here introduced as addressing Yahweh (compare <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>), and saying 'thy dead shall live;' that is, thy people shall live again shall be restored to to vigor, and strength, and enjoyment. They had been dead; that is, civilly dead in Babylon; they were cut off from their privileges, torn away from their homes, made captives in a foreign land. Their king had been dethroned; their temple demolished; their princes, priests, and people made captive; their name blotted from the list of nations; and to all intents and purposes, as a people, they were deceased. This figure is one that is common, by which the loss of privileges and enjoyments, and especially of civil rights, is represented as death. So we speak now of a man's being dead in law; dead to his country; spiritually dead; dead in sins. I do not understand this, therefore, as referring primarily to the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead; but to the captives in Babylon, who were civilly dead, and cut off by their oppressors from their rights and enjoyments as a nation.<p>Shall live - Shall be restored to their country. and be reinstated in all their rights and immunities as a people among the nations of the earth. This restoration shall be as striking as would be the resurrection of the dead front their graves. Though, therefore, this does not refer primarily to the resurrection of the dead, yet the illustration is drawn from that doctrine, and implies that that doctrine was one with which they were familiar. An image which is employed for the sake of illustration must be one that is familiar to the mind, and the reference here to this doctrine is a demonstration that the doctrine of the resurrection was well known.<p>Together with my dead body shall they arise - The words 'together with' are not in the original. The words rendered 'my dead body' (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;  nebe&#772;la&#770;thiy) literally means, 'my dead body,' and may be applied to a man, or to a beast <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-24.htm">Leviticus 7:24</a>. It is also applied to the dead in general; to the deceased; to carcasses, or dead bodies (see <a href="/leviticus/11-11.htm">Leviticus 11:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a>). It may, therefore, be rendered, 'My deceased, my dead;' and will thus be parallel with the phrase 'thy dead men,' and is used with reference to the same species of resurrection. It is not the language of the prophet Isaiah, as if he referred to his own body when it should be dead, but it is the language of the choir that sings and speaks in the name of the Jewish people. "That people" is thus introduced as saying "my" dead, that is, "our" dead, shall rise. Not only in the address to Yahweh is this sentiment uttered when it is said 'thy dead shall rise,' but when the attention is turned to themselves as a people, they say 'our dead shall rise;' those that pertain to our nation shall rise from the dust, and be restored to their own privileges and land.<p>Awake and sing - In view of the cheering and consolatory fact just stated that the dead shall rise, the chorus calls on the people to awake and rejoice. This is an address made directly to the dejected and oppressed people, as if the choir were with them.<p>Ye that dwell in dust - To sit in dust, or to dwell in the dust, is emblematic of a state of dejection, want, oppression, or poverty <a href="/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>. Here it is supposed to be addressed to the captives in Babylon, as oppressed, enslaved, dejected. The "language" is derived from the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, and proves that that doctrine was understood and believed; the sense is, that those wire were thus dejected and humbled should be restored to their former elevated privileges.<p>For thy dew - This is evidently an address to Yahweh. "His" dew is that which he sends down from heaven, and which is under his direction and control. Dew is the emblem of that which refreshes and vivifies. In countries where it rains but seldom, as it does in the East, the copious dews at night supply in some sense the want of rain. "Thence dew" is used in Scripture as an emblem of the graces and influences of the Spirit of God by which his people are cheered and comforted, as the parched earth and the withered herbs are refreshed by the copious dews at night. Thus in <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a> :<p>I will be as the dew unto Israel;<p>He shall grow as the lily,<p>And cast forth his roots as Lebanon.<p>The prophet here speaks of the captivity in Babylon. Their state is represented as a state of death - illustrated by the parched earth, and the decayed and withered herbs. But his grace and favor would visit them, and they would be revived.<p>As the dew of herbs - As the dew that falls on herbs. This phrase has, however, been rendered very variously. The Vulgate renders it, 'Thy dew is as the dew of light.' The Septuagint: 'Thy dew shall be healing (&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  iama) unto them.' The Chaldee, 'Thy dew shall be the dew of light.' But the most correct and consistent translation is undoubtedly that which renders the word &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;  'o&#770;roth, herbs or vegetables (compare <a href="/2_kings/9-19.htm">2 Kings 9:19</a>).<p>And the earth shall cast out the dead - This is language which is derived from the doctrine of the resurrection of the body; and shows also that that doctrine was understood by the Hebrews in the time of Isaiah. The sense is, that as the earth shall cast forth its dead in the resurrection, so the people of God in Babylon should be restored to life, and to their former privileges in their own land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. In antithesis to Isa 26:14, "They (Israel's foes) shall not live"; "Thy (Jehovah's) dead men (the Jews) shall live," that is, primarily, be restored, spiritually (Isa 54:1-3), civilly and nationally (Isa 26:15); whereas Thy foes shall not; ultimately, and in the fullest scope of the prophecy, restored to life literally (Eze 37:1-14; Da 12:2).<p>together with my dead body&#8212;rather, "my dead body," or "bodies" (the Jewish nation personified, which had been spiritually and civilly dead; or the nation, as a parent, speaking of the bodies of her children individually, see on [736]Isa 26:9, "I," "My"): Jehovah's "dead" and "my dead" are one and the same [Horsley]. However, as Jesus is the antitype to Israel (Mt 2:15), English Version gives a true sense, and one ultimately contemplated in the prophecy: Christ's dead body being raised again is the source of Jehovah's people (all, and especially believers, the spiritual Israelites) also being raised (1Co 15:20-22).<p>Awake&#8212;(Eph 5:14), spiritually.<p>in dust&#8212;prostate and dead, spiritually and nationally; also literally (Isa 25:12; 47:1).<p>dew&#8212;which falls copiously in the East and supplies somewhat the lack of rain (Ho 14:5).<p>cast out &#8230; dead&#8212;that is, shall bring them forth to life again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy dead men shall live.</span> The prophet here turneth his speech to God’s people, and gives them a cordial to support them in their deep distress, expressed in the foregoing verse.

But then the words seem to be better rendered, <span class="ital">and thou wilt cast the giants down to the ground</span>: either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">Thou</span>, O God, who is oft understood in such cases; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. <span class="ital">Thou</span>, O my people, to whom he speaks in the foregoing clauses of the verse, <span class="ital">thy dead body, and thy dew</span> and here continueth his speech, <span class="ital">thou wilt</span> or <span class="ital">shalt cast</span>, &c., thou shalt subdue even the most giant-like and mighty enemies; which though it be properly God’s work, the church is oft said to do, because she by her prayers engageth God to do it. And so as the former clauses of the verse speak of the deliverance and prosperity of God’s church and people, so this clause speaks of the destruction of their enemies, which usually accompanieth it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy dead men shall live,.... These are the words of Christ to his church and people, promising great and good things to them after their troubles are over, thereby comforting them under all their trials and disappointments; as that such things should come to pass, which would be as life from the dead; as the conversion of the Jews, and of great numbers of the Gentiles, dead in trespasses and sins; and a great reviving of the interest of religion, and of professors of it, grown cold, and dead, and lifeless; and a living again of the witnesses, which had been slain. And, moreover, this may refer to the first resurrection, upon the second coming of Christ, when the church's dead, and Christ's dead, the dead in him, will live again, and rise first, and come forth to the resurrection of life, and live and reign with Christ a thousand years: <p>together with my dead body shall they arise; or, "arise my dead body"; the church, the mystical body of Christ, and every member of it, though they have been dead, shall arise, everyone of them, and make up that body, which is the fulness of him that filleth all in all, and that by virtue of their union to him: there was a pledge and presage of this, when Christ rose from the dead, upon which the graves were opened, and many of the saints arose, <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a> see <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, or, "as my dead body shall they arise" (g); so Kimchi and Ben Melech; as sure as Christ's dead body was raised, so sure shall everyone of his people be raised; Christ's resurrection is the pledge and earnest of theirs; because he lives, they shall live also; he is the first fruits of them that slept: or as in like manner he was raised, so shall they; as he was raised incorruptible, powerful, spiritual, and glorious, and in the same body, so shall they; their vile bodies shall be fashioned like unto his glorious body. This is one of the places in Scripture from whence the Jews (h) prove the resurrection of the dead; and which they apply to the times of the Messiah, and to the resurrection in his days. <p>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; this is a periphrasis of the dead, of such as are brought to the dust of death, and sleep there; as death is expressed by sleeping, so the resurrection by awaking out of sleep; which will be brought about by the voice of Christ, which will be so loud and powerful, that the dead will hear it, and come out of their graves; and then will they "sing", and have reason for it, since they will awake in the likeness of Christ, and bear the image of him the heavenly One: <p>for thy dew is as the dew of herbs; the power of Christ will have as great effect upon, and as easily raise the dead, as the dew has upon the herbs, to refresh, raise, and revive them; so that their "bones", as the prophet says, "shall flourish like an herb", <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-14.htm">Isaiah 66:14</a>, <p>and the earth shall cast out the dead; deliver up the dead that are in it, at the all powerful voice of Christ; see <a href="/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>. The Targum is, <p>"but the wicked to whom thou hast given power, and they have transgressed thy word, thou wilt deliver into hell;'' <p>see <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>. <p>(g)  "quemadmodum corpus meum resurget", Vatablus.

Elias Levita in his Tishbi, p. 109. says the word is never used in Scripture but of the carcass of a beast or fowl that is dead; and never of a man that is dead, but of him that dies not a natural death, excepting this place, which speaks of the resurrection of the dead; and, adds he, <p>"I greatly wonder at it, how he (the prophet) should call the bodies of the pure righteous ones a carcass; no doubt there is a reason for it, known to the wise men and cabalists, which I am ignorant of.'' <p>But the words are spoken of one who did not die a natural, but a violent death, even the Messiah Jesus; and so just according to the Rabbin's own observation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{t}</span> Thy dead <i>men</i> shall live, <i>together with</i> my dead body shall they arise.

The answer to these utterances of disappointed hopes is the promise of the Resurrection. The speaker throughout is the community, and the words are addressed to God, with the exception of an apostrophe to the buried Israelites in the middle of the verse. There is indeed no decisive argument against the view of those who think that the first half of the verse expresses the longing of the nation for the restoration of its dead (“May thy dead live, &c.”), and the second the triumphant assurance of the prophet that the prayer shall be fulfilled. But it is more probable that the language throughout is that of confident belief and hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thy dead … arise</span>] Render with R.V., <span class="bld">Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies</span> (collect. in Hebr.) <span class="bld">shall arise</span>.

Comp. <a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>. The word means “herbs” in <a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm" title="And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.">2 Kings 4:39</a>, but the idea is too prosaic for this passage. It is a heavenly, supernatural, dew that is meant; as soon as this falls on the dead they awake to life. Duhm refers to a Talmudic representation of a dew kept in the seventh heaven which is to descend on the bones of the dead and quicken them into life. “Light” and “life” are frequently and naturally associated: <a href="/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-13.htm" title="For you have delivered my soul from death: will not you deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?">Psalm 56:13</a>; <a href="/job/3-20.htm" title="Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;">Job 3:20</a>; <a href="/job/33-30.htm" title="To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.">Job 33:30</a>; <a href="/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the earth shall cast out the dead</span>] Render: <span class="bld">the earth</span> (or <span class="bld">the land</span>) <span class="bld">shall bring forth shades</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/26-14.htm" title="They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.">Isaiah 26:14</a></span>). The verb is lit. “cause to fall,” but obviously in the sense explained under <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/26-18.htm" title="We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.">Isaiah 26:18</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The doctrine of the resurrection here presented is reached through the conviction, gradually produced by the long process of revelation, that the final redemption of Israel could not be accomplished within the limits of nature. It became clear that the hopes and aspirations engendered by the Spirit in believing minds pointed forward to the great miracle here described, and thus the belief in the resurrection was firmly bound up with the indestructible hopes of the future of Israel (cf. <a href="/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>). The idea is exhibited in a form which is immature in the light of New Testament teaching, but it practically represents the highest development of Old Testament revelation on this subject. The only passage which is slightly in advance of this is <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>, and even there a universal resurrection is not taught. Here the hope is restricted to Israelites (see <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/26-14.htm" title="They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.">Isaiah 26:14</a></span>) and no doubt to those Israelites who had departed this life in the faith and fear of God. On the other hand, the teaching of this verse is quite different from such passages as <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm" title="After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.">Hosea 6:2</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/37-1.htm" title="The hand of the LORD was on me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the middle of the valley which was full of bones,...">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>. There rising from the dead is but a figurative clothing of the idea of national regeneration, whereas there can be no doubt that here a literal resurrection of individuals is foretold.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - THE PROPHET'S COMMENT ON THE SONG OF THE JUST. Having concluded his "<span class="accented">song</span> of the just" in a minor key with a confession of human weakness, the prophet proceeds to cheer and encourage his disciples by a clear and positive declaration of the doctrine of the resurrection: "Thy dead, O Israel, shall live." He then adds a recommendation for the present - a recommendation to privacy and retirement, until the judgments of God which he has predicted (<a href="/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>.) are shown forth upon the earth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy dead men shall live</span>. A universal resurrection of" some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), is not yet announced; but only a resurrection of the just, perhaps only of the just Israelites. The object is encouragement, especially encouragement of those whom the prophet directly addresses - the religious Israelites of his own day. It is enough for them at the present time to know that, whether the day of the Lord comes in their time or no, when it <span class="accented">comes</span>, they will have a part in it. The assurance is given, and is made doubly sure by repetition. The prophet does not say, Together with <span class="cmt_word">my dead body</span> they will arise; for there is nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to "together," and the ellipse of '<span class="accented">ira</span>, "<span class="accented">with</span>," though suggested by Kimchi, is impossible; nor is it likely that he intends to speak of his own dead body at all. He may, perhaps, call the past generations of just Israelites "my dead," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead with whom he is in sympathy; or the supposed personal suffix may be merely paragogic, as Rosenm&uuml;ller argues. In any case the two clauses must be regarded as identical in meaning - an instance of "synonymous parallelism.... Thy dead men shall live; my dead shall arise." <span class="cmt_word">Awake and sing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">awake and shout for joy</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that dwell in dust</span> (comp. <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, "Many <span class="accented">that sleep in the dust of the earth</span> shall awake"). <span class="cmt_word">Thy dew is as the dew of herbs</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshing, vivifying, potent to make even dead bones live. "Thy dew" may be said with reference to Jehovah, for changes in the person addressed are frequent in Isaiah; or with reference to the people of Israel, meaning, "the dew which Jehovah will shed on thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on thy dead. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The situation still remains essentially the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11-13</a> : "Jehovah, Thy hand has been exalted, but they did not see: they will see the zeal for a people, being put to shame; yea, fire will devour Thine adversaries. Jehovah, Thou wilt establish peace for us: for Thou hast accomplished all our work for us. Jehovah our God, lords besides Thee had enslaved us; but through Thee we praise Thy name." Here are three forms of address beginning with Jehovah, and rising in the third to "Jehovah our God." The standpoint of the first is the time before the judgment; the standpoint of the other two is in the midst of the redemption that has been effected through judgment. Hence what the prophet states in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a> will be a general truth, which has now received its most splendid confirmation through the overthrow of the empire. The complaint of the prophet here is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>. We may also compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>, not <a href="/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>; (ru&#772;m does not mean to remain beyond and unrecognised, but to prove one's self to be high.) The hand of Jehovah had already shown itself to be highly exalted (ra&#770;ma&#770;h, 3 pr.), by manifesting itself in the history of the nations, by sheltering His congregation, and preparing the way for its exaltation in the midst of its humiliation; but as they had no eye for this hand, they would be made to feel it upon themselves as the avenger of His nation. The "zeal for a people," when reduced from this ideal expression into a concrete one, is the zeal of Jehovah of hosts (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>) for His own nation (as in <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). Kin'ath &#8219;a&#770;m (zeal for a people) is the object to yechezu&#772; (they shall see); v'ye&#772;bo&#772;shu&#772; (and be put to shame) being a parenthetical interpolation, which does not interfere with this connection. "Thou wilt establish peace" (tishpo&#772;t sha&#770;lom, <a href="/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>) expresses the certain hope of a future and imperturbable state of peace (pones, stabilies); and this hope is founded upon the fact, that all which the church has hitherto accomplished (ma&#8219;aseh, the acting out of its calling, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>, see at <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>) has not been its own work, but the work of Jehovah for it. And the deliverance just obtained from the yoke of the imperial power is the work of Jehovah also. The meaning of the complaint, "other lords beside Thee had enslaved us," is just the same as that in <a href="/isaiah/63-18.htm">Isaiah 63:18</a>; but there the standpoint is in the midst of the thing complained of, whereas here it is beyond it. Jehovah is Israel's King. He seemed indeed to have lost His rule, since the masters of the world had done as they liked with Israel. But it was very different now, and it was only through Jehovah ("through Thee") that Israel could now once more gratefully celebrate Jehovah's name. </body></html>
