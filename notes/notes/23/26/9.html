The “night” is the time of sorrow and expectation, in which the saints of God shall “watch for the morning” of the great day of judgment and deliverance. They welcomed the judgments” as the discipline, by which those who had failed to learn before would at last, it might be, learn and acknowledge the righteousness of God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:5-11 The way of the just is evenness, a steady course of obedience and holy conversation. And it is their happiness that God makes their way plain and easy. It is our duty, and will be our comfort, to wait for God, to keep up holy desires toward him in the darkest and most discouraging times. Our troubles must never turn us from God; and in the darkest, longest night of affliction, with our souls must we desire him; and this we must wait and pray to him for. We make nothing of our religion, whatever our profession may be, if we do not make heart-work of it. Though we come ever so early, we shall find God ready to receive us. The intention of afflictions is to teach righteousness: blessed is the man whom the Lord thus teaches. But sinners walk contrary to him. They will go on in their evil ways, because they will not consider what a God he is whose laws they persist in despising. Scorners and the secure will shortly feel, what now they will not believe, that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. They will not see the evil of sin; but they shall see. Oh that they would abandon their sins, and turn to the Lord, that he may have mercy upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With my soul ... in the night - By desiring God in the night, and by seeking him early, is meant that the desire to seek him was unremitted and constant. The prophet speaks of the pious Jews who were in captivity in Babylon; and says that it was the object of their unremitted anxiety to please God, and to do his will.<p>For when thy judgments are in the earth - This is given as a reason for what had just been said, that in their calamity they had sought God without ceasing. The reason is, that the punishments which he inflicted were intended to lead people to learn righteousness. The sentiment is expressed in a general form, though there is no doubt that the immediate reference is to the calamities which the Jews had suffered in their removal to Babylon as a punishment for their sins.<p>Learn righteousness - The design is to warn, to restrain, and to reform them. The immediate reference here was undoubtedly to the Jews, in whom this effect was seen in a remarkable manner in their captivity in Babylon. But it is also true of other nations; and though the effect of calamity is not always to turn a people to God, or to make them permanently righteous, yet it restrains them, and leads them at least to an external reformation, It is also true in regard to nations as well as individuals, that they make a more decided advance in virtue and piety in days of affliction than in the time of great external prosperity (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11-12</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

"Thou keepest the firmly-established mind in peace, peace; for his confidence rests on Thee." A gnome (borrowed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7-8</a>), but in a lyrical connection, and with a distinct reference to the church of the last days. There is no necessity to take &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; as standing for &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, as Knobel does. The state of mind is mentioned here as designating the person possessing it, according to his inmost nature. &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; (the mind) is the whole attitude and habit of a man as inwardly constituted, i.e., as a being capable of thought and will. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; is the same, regarded as having a firm hold in itself, and this it has whenever it has a firm hold on God (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>). This is the mind of the new Israel, and Jehovah keeps it, sha&#770;lom, sha&#770;lom (peace, peace; accusative predicates, used in the place of a consequential clause), i.e., so that deep and constant peace abides therein (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). Such a mind is thus kept by Jehovah, because its trust is placed in Jehovah. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; refers to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, according to Ewald, 149, d, and is therefore equivalent to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (cf., <a href="/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>), the passive participle, like the Latin confisus, fretus. To hang on God, or to be thoroughly devoted to Him, secures both stability and peace. </body></html>
