And it is their happiness that God makes their way plain and easy. It is our duty, and will be our comfort, to wait for God, to keep up holy desires toward him in the darkest and most discouraging times. Our troubles must never turn us from God; and in the darkest, longest night of affliction, with our souls must we desire him; and this we must wait and pray to him for. We make nothing of our religion, whatever our profession may be, if we do not make heart-work of it. Though we come ever so early, we shall find God ready to receive us. The intention of afflictions is to teach righteousness: blessed is the man whom the Lord thus teaches. But sinners walk contrary to him. They will go on in their evil ways, because they will not consider what a God he is whose laws they persist in despising. Scorners and the secure will shortly feel, what now they will not believe, that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. They will not see the evil of sin; but they shall see. Oh that they would abandon their sins, and turn to the Lord, that he may have mercy upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor - That is, evidently, those who had been despised by them, and who had been overcome and oppressed by them. The obvious reference here is to the Jews who had been captives there. The idea is not necessarily that the 'poor' referred to here I would be among the conquerors, but that when the Babylonians should be overcome, and their city destroyed, those who were then oppressed should be in circumstances of comparative prosperity. No doubt the Jews, who in subsequent times traveled to the site of Babylon for purposes of traffic, would trample indignantly on the remains of the city where their fathers were captives for seventy years, and would exult in the idea that their own once down-trodden city Jerusalem was in a condition of comparative prosperity. That there were many Jews in Babylon after that city began to decline from its haughtiness and grandeur, we learn expressly from both Philo and Josephus. Thus Philo (De Legatione ad Caium, p. 792) says, that 'it is known that Babylon and many other satraps were possessed by the Jews, not only by rumour, but by experience.' So Josephus (Ant. xv. 2.) says, that there were in the time of Hyrcanus many Jews at Babylon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. poor&#8212;(Isa 25:4), the once afflicted Jewish captives.

Two contrasted pictures are placed here side by side. The Jordan is the same as the "great gulf" in the parable of the rich man. Upon Zion Jehovah descends in mercy, but upon the highlands of Moab in His wrath. "For the hand of Jehovah will sink down upon this mountain, and Moab is trodden down there where it is, as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-pit. And he spreadeth out his hands in the pool therein, as the swimmer spreadeth them out to swim; but Jehovah forceth down the pride of Moab in spite of the artifices of his hands. Yea, thy steep, towering walls He bows down, forces under, and casts earthwards into dust." Jehovah brings down His hand upon Zion (nu&#772;ach, as in <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), not only to shelter, but also to avenge. Israel, that has been despised, He now makes glorious, and for contemptuous Moab He prepares a shameful end. In the place where it now is &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>, "in its own place," its own land) it is threshed down, stamped or trodden down, as straw is trodden down into a dung-pit to turn it into manure: hiddu&#772;sh, the inf. constr., with the vowel sound u, possibly to distinguish it from the inf. absol. hiddosh (Ewald, 240, b). Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; (as in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>), the chethib has &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; (cf., <a href="/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>); and this is probably the more correct reading, since madme&#772;na&#770;h, by itself, means the dunghill, and not the tank of dung water. At the same time, it is quite possible that b'mo is intended as a play upon the name Moab, just as the word madme&#772;na&#770;h may possibly have been chosen with a play upon the Moabitish Madme&#772;n (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a> Jehovah would be the subject, if b'kirbo (in the midst of it) referred back to Moab; but although the figure of Jehovah pressing down the pride of Moab, by spreading out His hands within it like a swimmer, might produce the impression of boldness and dignity in a different connection, yet here, where Moab has just been described as forced down into the manure-pit, the comparison of Jehovah to a swimmer would be a very offensive one. The swimmer is Moab itself, as Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, and in fact the majority of commentators suppose. "In the midst of it:" b'kirbo points back in a neuter sense to the place into which Moab had been violently plunged, and which was so little adapted for swimming. A man cannot swim in a manure pond; but Moab attempts it, though without success, for Jehovah presses down the pride of Moab in spite of its artifices &#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="/nehemiah/5-18.htm">Nehemiah 5:18</a>; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, written with dagesh (according to the majority of MSS, from &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, like the Arabic urbe, irbe, cleverness, wit, sharpness), i.e., the skilful and cunning movement of its hands. Saad. gives it correctly, as mucha&#770;tale, wiles and stratagems; Hitzig also renders it "machinations," i.e., twistings and turnings, which Moab makes with its arms, for the purpose of keeping itself up in the water. What <a href="/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a> affirms in figure, <a href="/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a> illustrates without any figure. If the reading were &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1498; &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, the reference would be to Kir-Moab (<a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>). But as the text stands, we are evidently to understand by it the strong and lofty walls of the cities of Moab in general. </body></html>
