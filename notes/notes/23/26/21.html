The prophet has in his thoughts the reckless destruction of life which characterised the great world-powers of Assyria and Babylon.

Thus we shall be safe and happy in the midst of tribulations. It is but for a short time, as it were for a little moment; when over, it will seem as nothing. God's place is the mercy-seat; there he delights to be: when he punishes, he comes out of his place, for he has no pleasure in the death of sinners. But there is hardly any truth more frequently repeated in Scripture, than God's determined purpose to punish the workers of iniquity. Let us keep close to the Lord, and separate from the world; and let us seek comfort in secret prayer. A day of vengeance is coming on the world, and before it comes we are to expect tribulation and suffering. But because the Christian looks for these things, shall he be restless and dismayed? No, let him repose himself in his God. Abiding in him, the believer is safe. And let us wait patiently the fulfilling of God's promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place - That is, from heaven, which is the dwelling-place or residence of God <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>. When God executes vengeance, he is represented as coming from his abode, his dwelling-place, his capitol, as a monarch goes forth to war to destroy his foes.<p>To punish the inhabitants of the earth - The land of Chaldea, or of Babylon.<p>The earth also shall disclose her blood - Blood, in the Scriptures, often denotes "guilt." The sense here is, that the land of Chaldea would reveal its guilt; that is, the punishment which God would inflict would be a revelation of the crimes of the nation. There is a resemblance here to the language which was used respecting the blood of Abel, <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> : 'The voice of thy brother's blood (Hebrew as here, "bloods") crieth unto me from the ground.<p>And shall no more cover her slain - Shall no more be able to conceal its guilt in slaying the people of God. By these hopes, the Jews were to be comforted in their calamity; and no doubt this song was penned by Isaiah long before that captivity, in order that, in the midst of their protracted and severe trials, they might be consoled with the hope of deliverance, and might know what to do when the storms of war should rage around the place of their captivity, and when the proud city was to fall. They were not to mingle in the strife; were to take no part with either their foes or their deliverers; but were to be calm, gentle, peaceful, and to remember that all this was to effect their deliverance. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a> : 'Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh; Yahweh shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.' There are times when the children of God should look calmly on the conflicts of the people of this world. They should mingle with neither party, for they should remember that Yahweh presides over these agitations, and that their ultimate end is to bring deliverance to his church, and to advance the interests of his kingdom on the earth. Then they should be mild, gentle, prayerful; and should look up to God to make all these agitations and strifes the means of advancing the interests of his kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

In the Psalms God is represented as "bowing the heavens and coming down," bringing them, as it were, with him. Here (and in Micah) he quits his place in heaven, as a king quits his own country when he proceeds to take vengeance on rebels in another. The expressions are, both of them, accommodations to human modes of thought. <span class="cmt_word">To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earth also shall disclose her blood</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her bloods</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her bloodsheddings; the many murders committed by man upon her surface. Isaiah denounced "murderers" in his first chapter (ver. 27). Manasseh's murders were the main cause of the first destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). The second destruction was equally a judgment for the innocent blood that had been shed upon the earth, "from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Bars-chins" (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). Bloodshed "cries to God for vengeance" (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), and will be one of the main causes of the world's final destruction (<a href="/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And shall no more cover her slain</span>.

"Thou hast added to the nation, O Jehovah, hast added to the nation; glorified Thyself; moved out all the borders of the land." The verb &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, which is construed in other cases with &#1506;&#1500;, &#1488;&#1500; ,, here with &#1500;, carried its object within itself: to add, i.e., to give an increase. The allusion is to the same thing as that which caused the prophet to rejoice in <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>., <a href="/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; <a href="/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19-20</a>, and many other passages; and for richakta&#770;, more especially <a href="/micah/7-11.htm">Micah 7:11</a>). Just as <a href="/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a> recals the bondage in Egypt, and <a href="/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a> the destruction of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, so <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a> recals the numerical strength of the nation, and the extent of the country in the time of David and Solomon. At the same time, we cannot say that the prophet intended to recall these to mind. The antitypical relation, in which the last times stand to these events and circumstances of the past, is a fact in sacred history, though not particularly referred to here. </body></html>
