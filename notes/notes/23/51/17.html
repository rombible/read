Jerusalem had provoked God, and was made to taste the bitter fruits. Those who should have been her comforters, were their own tormentors. They have no patience by which to keep possesion of their own souls, nor any confidence in God's promise, by which to keep possession of its comfort. Thou art drunken, not as formerly, with the intoxicating cup of Babylon's idolatries, but with the cup of affliction. Know, then, the cause of God's people may for a time seem as lost, but God will protect it, by convincing the conscience, or confounding the projects, of those that strive against it. The oppressors required souls to be subjected to them, that every man should believe and worship as they would have them. But all they could gain by violence was, that people were brought to outward hypocritical conformity, for consciences cannot be forced.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Awake, awake - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). This verse commences an address to Jerusalem under a new figure or image. The figure employed is that of a man who has been overcome by the cup of the wrath of Yahweh, that had produced the same effect as inebriation. Jerusalem had reeled and fallen prostrate. There had been none to sustain her, and she had sunk to the dust. Calamities of the most appalling kind had come upon her, and she is now called on to arouse from this condition, and to recover her former splendor and power.<p>Which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord - The wrath of Yahweh is not unfrequently compared to a cup producing intoxication. The reason is, that it produces a similar effect. It prostrates the strength, and makes the subject of it reel, stagger, and fall. In like manner, all calamities are represented under the image of a cup that is drunk, producing a prostrating effect on the frame. Thus the Saviour says, 'The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?' (<a href="/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-42.htm">Matthew 26:42</a>). The effects of drinking the cup of God's displeasure are often beautifully set forth. Thus, in <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a> :<p>In the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is red;<p>It is full of a mixed liquor, and he poureth out of the same,<p>Verily the dregs thereof all the ungodly of the earth shall wring them out and drink them.<p>Plato, as referred to by Lowth, has an idea resembling this. 'Suppose,' says he, 'God had given to men a medicating potion inducing fear; so that the more anyone should drink of it, so much the more miserable he should find himself at every draught, and become fearful of everything present and future; and at last, though the most courageous of people, should become totally possessed by fear; and afterward, having slept off the effects of it, should become himself again.' A similar image is used by Homer (Iliad, xvi. 527ff), where he places two vessels at the threshold of Jupiter, one of good, the other of evil. He gives to some a mixed potion of each; to others from the evil vessel only, and these are completely miserable:<p>Two urns by Jove's high throne have ever stood<p>The source of evil one, and one of good;<p>From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,<p>Blessings to these; to those distributes ills.<p>To most he mingles both: The wretch decreed<p>To taste the bad unmix'd, is curs'd indeed;<p>Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,<p>He wanders, outcast by both earth and heaven:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The city is figured as a woman lying prostrate and senseless, intoxicated with the cup of the Lord’s indignation which she has drunk to the dregs, her sons unable to help her (17–20). But the cup is now taken from her and passed to the enemies who had oppressed and insulted her (21–23).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>-2<a href="/context/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean....">Isaiah 52:1-6</a>. In a new apostrophe, the image is carried on; let Zion lay aside her soiled raiment, and the emblems of her slavery, and put on her holiday attire (1, 2). Jehovah will no longer endure that His name should be blasphemed through the banishment of His people (3–6).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/51-7.htm" title="Listen to me, you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear you not the reproach of men, neither be you afraid of their revilings....">Isaiah 51:7-12</a></span>.

The writer pictures the scene of joy within the city when the heralds of the King arrive (7, 8); he calls on the waste places of Jerusalem to break forth into singing (9, 10); and finally, turning to the exiles (as in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm" title="Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.">Isaiah 48:20</a> f.) he summons them to hasten their escape from the land of their captivity (11, 12).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-23.</span> - AN ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET TO JERUSALEM.

After this, an assurance is given her that the miseries which she has suffered shall pass from her to her great enemy, by whom the dregs of the "cup of trembling" shall be drained, and the last drop wrung out (vers. 21-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. ver. 9 and <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>). Isaiah marks the breaks in his prophecy, sometimes by a repetition of terminal clauses, which have the effect of a refrain (<a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; and Isaiah 48:22; 57:21); sometimes by a repetition of initial clauses of a striking character (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 11, 20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1, 11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1, 12, 16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4, 7, 9</a>, etc.). Here we have thrice over "Awake, awake" - not, however, an exact repetition in the Hebrew, but a near approach to it each summons forming the commencement of a new paragraph or subsection<span class="cmt_word">. Which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury.</span> The cup of God's fury was poured out on Jerusalem when the city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, the temple, the royal palace, and the houses of the nobles burnt (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), the walls broken down (<a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>), and the bulk of the inhabitants carried away captive to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-25.htm">2 Chronicles 34:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-31.htm">Ezekiel 22:31</a>, etc.). "The cup of God's fury" is an expression used by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). The dregs of the cup; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the goblet-cup</span> (Cheyne), or <span class="accented">the out-swollen cup.</span> It is the fulness of the measure of Jerusalem's punishment, not its character, which is pointed at. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But just as such an exhortation as this followed very naturally from the grand promises with which they prophecy commenced, so does a longing for the promised salvation spring out of this exhortation, together with the assurance of its eventual realization. "Awake, awake, clothe thyself in might, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of ancient time, the ages of the olden world! Was it not thou that didst split Rahab in pieces, and pierced the dragon? Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea, the waters of the great billow; that didst turn the depths of the sea into a way for redeemed to pass through? Ad the emancipated of Jehovah will return, and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting joy upon their head: they grasp at gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee away." The paradisaical restoration of Zion, the new world of righteousness and salvation, is a work of the arm of Jehovah, i.e., of the manifestation of His might. His arm is now in a sleeping state. It is not lifeless, indeed, but motionless. Therefore the church calls out to it three times, "Awake" (&#8219;u&#772;r&#305;&#772;: to avoid monotony, the milra and milel tones are interchanged, as in <a href="/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>).<p>(Note: See Norzi and Luzzatto's Grammatica della Lingua Ebr. 513.)<p>It is to arise and put on strength out of the fulness of omnipotence (la&#770;bhe&#772;sh as in <a href="/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>; cf., &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>, and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, arm thyself with strength, in Il. 19:36; 9:231). The arm of Jehovah is able to accomplish what the prophecy affirms and the church hopes for; since it has already miraculously redeemed Israel once. Rahabh is Egypt represented as a monster of the waters (see <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>), and tann&#305;&#772;n is the same (cf., <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), but with particular reference to Pharaoh (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, tu illud, is equivalent to "thou, yea thou" (see at <a href="/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>). The Red Sea is described as the "waters of the great deep" (teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h), because the great storehouse of waters that lie below the solid ground were partially manifested there. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; has double pashta; it is therefore milel, and therefore the third pr.  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (Ges. 109, Anf.). <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>, being attached to &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the previous verse, jut as it is there. Instead of &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, which we find here, we have there &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;; in everything else the two passages are word for word the same. Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel suppose that <a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> was not written by the author of these addresses, but was interpolated by some one else. But in <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a> we meet with just the same kind of repetition from chapters 1-39; and in the first part we find, at any rate, repetitions in the form of refrains and others of a smaller kind (like <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>). And <a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> forms a conclusion here, just as it does in <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>. An argument is founded upon the olden time with reference to the things to be expected now; the look into the future is cleared and strengthened by the look into the past. And thus will the emancipated of Jehovah return, being liberated from the present calamity as they were delivered from the Egyptian then. The first half of this prophecy is here brought to a close. It concludes with expressions of longing and of hope, the echo of promises that had gone before. </body></html>
