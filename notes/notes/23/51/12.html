This is an answer to the prayer of the prophet, or the church by him, in which the Lord promises not only assistance and help, but comfort; not only to exert his power and show his great strength by making bare his arm; but to open his heart, unbosom himself, and show his great love and strong affection for them; and so administer divine comforts unto them, giving more than was asked for: and he promises to do it himself, not by his prophets and ministers, word and ordinances, though these are the usual means; but he himself would do it by his Spirit and grace, and the immediate discoveries of his love; and which he repeats, to show the certainty of it, as well as to point out to their view the great Comforter himself; which is an instance of amazing condescension, and could not fail of exciting admiration and thankfulness in them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>, <p>who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die; a poor faint hearted creature indeed, to be afraid of a frail mortal dying man; which is the case of every man, even of the greatest of men, of the kings and princes of the earth, who all die like other men; the most proud and haughty tyrants, the fierce and furious persecutors of the people of God. Perhaps the Roman Pagan persecutors may be had in view, whose edicts were very terrible to the first Christians, whose persecutions were very violent and furious, and the tortures and deaths they put them to were very dreadful; and which put them in great fear though they had no reason to fear them that could destroy the body, and do no more; and the rather, since these were mortal men, and did die, and their persecutions came to an end. Or it may be, the man of sin, the son of perdition, antichrist, is here referred to, who in his time has made all to tremble at him, <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a> but must die, and his power too, and will be destroyed with the breath of Christ's mouth, and the brightness of his coming; and therefore his church and people have no reason to be afraid of him: <p>and of the son of man, which shall be made as grass; as weak as that, which cannot stand before the scythe, is cut down, and tossed about, and trampled upon, and made hay of, and becomes the food of beasts, <a href="/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>. Or the words may be rendered, "and of the son of man, to whom grass shall be given"; (r) which if understood of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, of whom the people of the Jews were afraid, and who was a type of antichrist, it was literally true of him, <a href="/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a>. <p>(r)  "herba dabitur", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">I</span> am <span class="ital">he that comforteth you</span>] Cf. <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm" title="Comfort you, comfort you my people, said your God.">Isaiah 40:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-13.htm" title="Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy on his afflicted.">Isaiah 49:13</a>.

"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens will pass away like smoke, and the earth fall to pieces like a garment, and its inhabitants die out like a nonentity; and my salvation will last for ever, and my righteousness does not go to ruin." The reason for the summons follows with k&#305;&#772;. The heavens will be resolved into atoms, like smoke: nimla&#770;chu&#772; from ma&#770;lach, related to ma&#770;rach, root mal, from which comes ma&#770;lal (see at <a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>), to rub to pieces, to crumble to pieces, or mangle; Aquila, &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, to thresh. As mela&#770;ch&#305;&#772;m signifies rags, the figure of a garment that has fallen to pieces, which was then quite ready to hand (<a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>), presented itself from the natural association of ideas. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;, however, cannot mean "in like manner" (lxx, Targ., Jerome); for if we keep to the figure of a garment falling to pieces, the figure is a very insipid one; and if we refer it to the fate of the earth generally, the thought which it offers is a very tame one. The older expositors were not even acquainted with what is now the favourite explanation, viz., "as gnats perish" (Hitzig, Ewald, Umbreit, Knobel, Stier, etc.); since the singular of kinn&#305;&#772;m is no more ke&#772;n than the singular of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1509;. The gnat (viz., a species of stinging gnat, probably the diminutive but yet very troublesome species which is called akol uskut, "eat and be silent," in Egyptian) is called kinna&#770;h, as the talmudic usage shows, where the singular, which does not happen to be met with in the Old Testament, is found in the case of kinn&#305;&#772;m as well as in that of be&#772;ts&#305;&#772;m.<p>(Note: Kinna&#770;m, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-13.htm">Exodus 8:13-14</a>, whether it be a collective plural or a singular, also proves nothing in support of ke&#772;n, any more than midda&#770;h in <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a> (which see) in favour of mad, in the sense of measure. It does not follow, that because a certain form lies at the foundation of a derivative, it must have been current in ordinary usage.)<p>We must explain the word in the same manner as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="/job/9-35.htm">Job 9:35</a>. In all these passages ke&#772;n merely signifies "so" (ita, sic); but just as in the classical languages, these words often derive their meaning from the gesture with which they are accompanied (e.g., in Terence's Eunuch: Cape hoc flabellum et ventulum sic facito). This is probably Rckert's opinion, when he adopts the rendering: and its inhabitants "like so" (so wie so) do they die. But "like so" is here equivalent to "like nothing." That the heavens and the earth do not perish without rising again in a renewed form, is a thought which may naturally be supplied, and which is distinctly expressed in <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>. Righteousness (tseda&#770;qa&#770;h) and salvation (yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h) are the heavenly powers, which acquire dominion through the overthrow of the ancient world, and become the foundations of the new (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). That the tseda&#770;qa&#770;h will endure for ever, and the yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h will not be broken (ye&#772;chath, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>, confringetur, whereas in <a href="/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a> the meaning is consternemini), is a prospect that opens after the restoration of the new world, and which indirectly applies to men who survive the catastrophe, having become partakers of righteousness and salvation. For righteousness and salvation require beings in whom to exert their power. </body></html>
