He that designs such joy for us at last, will he not work such deliverance in the mean time, as our cases require? In this world of changes, it is a short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall never come in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answers them with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God, we should not fear the frowns of men. Happy is the man that fears God always. And Christ's church shall enjoy security by the power and providence of the Almighty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou not it - Art thou not still the same? The ground of the appeal is, that the same arm that dried up the sea, and made a path for the Jewish people, was still able to interpose and rescue them.<p>Which hath dried the sea - The Red Sea when the children of Israel passed over <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>. This is the common illustration to which the Hebrew prophets and poets appeal, when they wish to refer to the interposition of God in favor of their nation (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>).<p>For the ransomed to pass over - Those who had been ransomed from Egypt. The word rendered 'ransomed' is that which is commonly rendered 'redeemed.' The argument in this verse is, that he who had overcome all the obstacles in the way of their deliverance from Egypt, was able also to overcome all the obstacles in the way of their deliverance from Babylon; and that he who had thus interposed might be expected again to manifest his mercy, and save them again from oppression. The principle involved in the argument is as applicable now as it was then. All God's past interpositious - and especially the great and wonderful interposition when be gave his Son for his church - constitute an argument that be will still continue to regard the interests of his people, and will interpose in their behalf and save them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. it&#8212;the arm.<p>Art not Thou the same Almighty power that &#8230; ? dried the sea&#8212;the Red Sea (Isa 43:16; Ex 14:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Art thou not it which hath dried the sea?</span> art not thou the same God, and as potent now as then thou wast? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the ransomed; </span> for thy people, whom thou didst redeem and bring out of Egypt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/51.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep,....

The transition is explained by the fact that every exhibition of Jehovah’s power over the sea was regarded as a repetition on a smaller scale of the original miracle of creation.

"Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear unto me, O my congregation! for instruction will go forth from me, and I make a place for my right, to be a light of the nations. My righteousness is near, my salvation is drawn out, and my arms will judge nations: the hoping of the islands looks to me, and for mine arm is their waiting." It is Israel which is here summoned to hearken to the promise introduced with k&#305;&#772;. &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is only used here of Israel, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; in <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; and the lxx (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;) have quite misunderstood it. An address to the heathen would be quite out of harmony with the character of the whole prophecy, which is carried out quite consistently throughout. &#1506;&#1502;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;, therefore, are not plurals, as the Syriac supposes, although it cannot be disputed that it is a rare thing to meet with the plural form apocopated thus, after the form of the talmudic Aramaean; and see also at <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>). What <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>. describes as the calling of the servant of Jehovah, viz., to carry out justice among the nations, and to plant it on the earth, appears here as the act of Jehovah; but, as a comparison of &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; with &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>) clearly shows, as the act of the God who is present in Israel, and works from Israel outwards. Out of Israel sprang the Saviour; out of Israel the apostleship; and when God shall have mercy upon Israel again, it will become to the whole world of nations "life from the dead." The thora&#770;h referred to here is that of Sion, as distinguished from that of Sinai, the gospel of redemption, and mishpa&#770;t the new order of life in which Israel and the nations are united. Jehovah makes for this a place of rest, a firm standing-place, from which its light to lighten the nations streams forth in all directions. &#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>, from &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, in the sense of the Arabic rj&#8219;, to return, to procure return, entrance, and rest; a different word from &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>, which signifies the very opposite, viz., to disturb, literally to throw into trembling. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1506;, which occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>, are synonyms throughout these prophecies. The meaning of the former is determined by the character of the thorah, which gives "the knowledge of salvation" (<a href="/luke/1-77.htm">Luke 1:77</a>), and with that "the righteousness of God" (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; cf., <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>). This righteousness is now upon the point of being revealed; this salvation has started on the way towards the fullest realization. The great mass of the nations fall under the judgment which the arms of Jehovah inflict, as they cast down to the ground on the right hand and on the left. When it is stated of the islands, therefore, that they hope for Jehovah, and wait for His arm, the reference is evidently to the remnant of the heathen nations, which outlives the judgment, and not only desires salvation, and is susceptible of it, but which actually receives salvation (compare the view given in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, which agrees with that of Isaiah, and which, in fact, is the biblical view generally, e.g., <a href="/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>). To these the saving arm (the singular only was suitable here; cf., <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>) now brings that salvation, towards which their longing was more or less consciously directed, and which satisfied their inmost need. Observe in <a href="/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a> the majestic and self-conscious movement of the rhythm, with the effective tone of yeyache&#772;lu&#770;n. </body></html>
