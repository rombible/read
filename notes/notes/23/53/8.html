Or, as Dr. Doddridge explains it, “Jesus appeared in so <span class="ital">humble a form, </span>that, though Pilate was convinced of his innocence, he seemed <span class="ital">a person of so little importance </span>that it would not be worth while to hazard any thing to preserve him.” They who prefer the translation given in our text, as Beza and many other commentators do, think the words refer to Christ’s being <span class="ital">taken, </span>by his resurrection, <span class="ital">from his confinement </span>in the grave, (which they suppose to be here called a <span class="ital">prison, </span>as it is termed a house, <a href="/job/30-23.htm" title="For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.">Job 30:23</a>, and a pit, <a href="/psalms/69-15.htm" title="Let not the flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth on me.">Psalm 69:15</a>,) and <span class="ital">from the judgment, </span>or <span class="ital">sentence, </span>which had been executed upon him: “agreeable to which Mr. L’Enfant renders it, <span class="ital">His condemnation was taken away by his very abasement; </span>that is, his stooping to death gave occasion to his triumph.” <span class="ital">And who shall declare his generation </span>— “This is one of the many passages of the Old Testament prophecies,” says Dr. Doddridge, “in which it is not so difficult to find a sense fairly applicable to Christ, as to know which to prefer of several that are so. Many ancient, as well as modern writers, have referred it to the <span class="ital">mystery of his Deity,” </span>his eternal generation, “or his <span class="ital">incarnation,” </span>his miraculous conception. “But Calvin and Beza say, this was owing to their ignorance of the Hebrew, the word <span class="greekheb">דור</span>not admitting such a sense; and it is certain it very ill suits the connection with the following clause.” Some understand it as referring to his not having any witnesses to appear for him and give an account of his life and character. This interpretation is preferred by Bishop Lowth, who therefore renders the clause, <span class="ital">And his</span> <span class="ital">manner of life who would declare? </span>Others again, among whom are Calvin and Beza, think it is as if the prophet had said, “Who can declare how long he shall live and reign, or <span class="ital">count the numerous offspring </span>that shall descend from him?” But, “not to say that this idea is much more clearly expressed by the prophet, <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a>, which, on this interpretation, is a <span class="ital">tautology,” </span>it does not appear that <span class="greekheb">דור</span>, <span class="ital">generation, </span>and <span class="greekheb">זרע</span>, <span class="ital">seed, </span>are ever used as synonymous terms. The former of these words, in the Hebrew, signifies the same with <span class="ital">a generation of men, </span>in English, who are contemporaries; (see <a href="/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>; <a href="/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Jdg 2:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-10.htm" title="Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:">Psalm 95:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm" title="Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.">Psalm 109:13</a>;) and <span class="greekheb">γενεα</span>, in the LXX., by which it is here rendered, has most frequently this sense. “Therefore, I suppose,” says Dr. Doddridge, “with Dr. Hammond, the sense to be, ‘Who can describe the obstinate infidelity and barbarous injustice of <span class="ital">that generation </span>of men, among whom he appeared, and from whom he suffered such things?’” <span class="ital">For he was cut off </span>— Namely, by a violent death; <span class="ital">out of the land of the living </span>— By the <span class="ital">wicked hands </span>of those whom he came to save: see <a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>. <span class="ital">For the transgression </span>— Or, as some render, <span class="greekheb">מפשׁע עמי</span>, <span class="ital">By the transgression of my people was he stricken </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נגע למו</span>, <span class="ital">the stroke was on him; </span>that is, he was stricken, was crucified and slain, by or through the wickedness of the Jews. The former, however, is doubtless the sense intended, for, as the angel testified to Daniel, (<a href="/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a>,) the Messiah was to be <span class="ital">cut off, not for himself, </span>but for the sins and salvation of mankind. And this, though asserted <a href="/context/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted....">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>, is here repeated as a doctrine that cannot be too frequently inculcated, or too much regarded; and to prevent men’s mistakes about, or stumbling at, the humiliation of Christ, as though he had suffered and died for his own sins.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was taken from prison - Margin, 'Away by distress and judgment.' The general idea in this verse is, that the sufferings which he endured for his people were terminated by his being, after some form of trial, cut off out of the land of the living. Lowth renders this, 'By an oppressive judgment he was taken off.' Noyes, 'By oppression and punishment he was taken away.' The Septuagint renders it, 'In his humiliation (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  en te&#772; tapeino&#772;sei), his judgment (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;  he&#772; krisis autou), (his legal trial. Thomson), was taken away;' and this translation was followed by Philip when he explained the passage to the eunuch of Ethiopia <a href="/acts/8-33.htm">Acts 8:33</a>. The eunuch, a native of Ethiopia, where the Septuagint was commonly used, was reading this portion of Isaiah in that version, and the version was sufficiently accurate to express the general sense of the passage, though it is by no means a literal translation.<p>The Chaldee renders this verse, 'From infirmities and retribution he shall collect our captivity, and the wonders which shall be done for us in his days who can declare? Because he shall remove the dominion of the people from the land of Israel; the sins which my people have sinned shall come even unto them.' The Hebrew word which is here used (&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;  &#8219;otser, from &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;  &#8219;a&#770;tsar, "to shut up, to close," means properly "a shutting up," or "closure"; and then constraint, oppression, or vexation. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-39.htm">Psalm 107:39</a>, it means violent restraint, or oppression. It does not mean prison in the sense in which that word is now used. It refers rather to restraint, and detention; and would be better translated by confinement, or by violent oppressions. The Lord Jesus, moreover, was not confined in prison. He was bound, and placed under a guard, and was thus secured. But neither the word used here, nor the account in the New Testament, leads us to suppose that in fact he was incarcerated. There is a strict and entire conformity between the statement here, and the facts as they occurred on the trial of the Redeemer (see <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>; compare the notes at <a href="/acts/8-33.htm">Acts 8:33</a>).<p>And from judgment - From a judicial decision; or by a judicial sentence. This statement is made in order to make the account of his sufferings more definite. He did not merely suffer affliction; he was not only a man of sorrows in general; he did not suffer in a tumult, or by the excitement of a mob: but he suffered under a form of law, and a sentence was passed in his case (compare <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>), and in accordance with that he was led forth to death. According to Hengstenberg, the two words here 'by oppression,' and 'by judicial sentence,' are to be taken together as a hendiadys, meaning an oppressive, unrighteous proceeding. So Lowth understands it. It seems to me, however, that they are rather to be taken as denoting separate things - the detention or confinement preliminary to the trial, and the sentence consequent upon the mock trial.<p>And who shall declare his generation? - The word rendered 'declare' means to relate, or announce. 'Who can give a correct statement in regard to it' - implying either that there was some want of willingness or ability to do it. This phrase has been very variously interpreted; and it is by no means easy to fix its exact meaning. Some have supposed that it refers to the fact that when a prisoner was about to be led forth to death, a crier made proclamation calling on anyone to come forward and assert his innocence, and declare his manner of life. But there is not sufficient proof that this was done among the Jews, and there is no evidence that it was done in the case of the Lord Jesus. Nor would this interpretation exactly express the sense of the Hebrew. In regard to the meaning of the passage, besides the sense referred to above, we may refer to the following opinions which have been held, and which are arranged by Hengstenberg:<p>1. Several, as Luther, Calvin, and Vitringa, translate it, 'Who will declare the length of his life?' that is, who is able to determine the length of his future days - meaning that there would be no end to his existence, and implying that though he would be cut off, yet he would be raised again, and would live forever. To this, the only material objection is, that the word &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;  do&#770;r (generation), is not used elsewhere in that sense. Calvin, however, does not refer it to the personal life of the Messiah, so to speak, but to his life in the church, or to the perpetuity of his life and principles in the church which he redeemed. His words are: 'Yet we are to remember that the prophet does not speak only of the person of Christ, but embraces the whole body of the church, which ought never to be separated from Christ. We have, therefore, says he, a distinguished testimony respecting the perpetuity of the church. For as Christ lives for ever, so he will not suffer his kingdom to perish' - (Commentary in loc.)<p>2. Others translate it, 'Who of his contemporaries will consider it,' or 'considered it?' So Storr, Doderlin, Dathe, Rosenmuller and Gesenius render it. According to Gesenius it means, 'Who of his contemporaries considered that he was taken out of the land of the living on account of the sin of my people?'<p>3. Lowth and some others adopt the interpretation first suggested, and render it, 'His manner of life who would declare?' In support of this, Lowth appeals to the passages from the Mishna and the Gemara of Babylon, where it is said that before anyone was punished for a capital crime, proclamation was made before him by a crier in these words, 'Whosoever knows anything about his innocence, let him come and make it known.' On this passage the Gemara of Babylon adds, 'that before the death of Jesus, this proclamation was made forty days; but no defense could be found.' This is certainly false; and there is no sufficient reason to think that the custom prevailed at all in the time of Isaiah, or in the time of the Saviour.<p>4. Others render it, 'Who can express his posterity, the number of his descendants?' So Hengstenberg renders it. So also Kimchi.<p>5. Some of the fathers referred it to the humanity of Christ, and to his miraculous conception. This was the belief of Chrysostom. See Calvin in loc. So also Morerius and Cajetan understood it.<p>But the word is never used in this sense. The word &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;  do&#770;r (generation), means properly an age, a generation of human beinigs; the revolving period or circle of human life; from &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;  du&#770;r, a circle <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>. It then means, also, a dwelling, a habitation <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>. It occurs often in the Old Testament, and is in all other instances translated 'generation,' or 'generations.' Amidst the variety of interpretations which have been proposed, it is perhaps not possible to determine with any considerable degree of certainty what is the true sense of the passage. The only light, it seems to me, which can be thrown on it, is to be derived from the 10th verse, where it is said, 'He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days;' and this would lead us to suppose that the sense is, that he would have a posterity which no one would be able to enumerate, or declare. According to this, the sense would be, 'He shall be indeed cut off out of the land of the living. But his name, his race shall not be extinct. Notwithstanding this, his generation, race, posterity, shall be so numerous that no one shall be able to declare it.' This interpretation is not quite satisfactory, but it has more probabilities in its favor than any other.<p>For - (&#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y). This particle does not here denote the cause of what was just stated, but points out the connection (compare <a href="/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>). In these places it denotes the same as 'and.' This seems to be the sense here. Or, if it be here a causal particle, it refers not to what immediately goes before, but to the general strain and drift of the discourse. All this would occur to him because he was cut off on account of the transgression of his people. He was taken from confinement, and was dragged to death by a judicial sentence, and he should have a numerous spiritual posterity, because he was cut off on account of the sins of the people.<p>He was cut off - This evidently denotes a violent, and not a peaceful death. See <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a> : 'And after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.' The Septuagint renders it, 'For his life is taken away from the earth.' The word used here (&#1490;&#1494;&#1512;  ga&#770;zar), means properly "to cut, to cut in two, to divide." It is applied to the act of cutting down trees with an axe (see <a href="/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a>). Here the natural and obvious idea is, that he would be violently taken away, as if he was cut down in the midst of his days. The word is never used to denote a peaceful death, or a death in the ordinary course of events; and the idea which would be conveyed by it would be, that the person here spoken of would be cut off in a violent manner in the midst of his life.<p>For the transgression of my people - The meaning of this is not materially different from 'on account of our sins.' 'The speaker here - Isaiah - does not place himself in opposition to the people, but includes himself among them, and speaks of them as his people, that is, those with whom he was connected' - (Hengstenberg). Others, however, suppose that Yahweh is here introduced as speaking, and that he says that the Messiah was to be cut off for the sins of his people.<p>Was he stricken - Margin, 'The stroke upon him;' that is, the stroke came upon him. The word rendered in the margin 'stroke' (&#1504;&#1490;&#1506;  nega&#8219;), denotes properly a blow <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a> :<a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; then a spot, mark, or blemish in the skin, whether produced by the leprosy or any other cause. It is the same word which is used in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a> (see the note on that verse). The Hebrew, which is rendered in the margin 'upon him' (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;  la&#770;mo&#770;) has given rise to much discussion. It is properly and usually in the plural form, and it has been seized upon by those who maintain that this whole passage refers not to one individual but to some collective body, as of the people, or the prophets (see Analysis prefixed to <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>), as decisive of the controversy. To this word Rosenmuller, in his Prolegomena to the chapter, appeals for a decisive termination of the contest, and supposes the prophet to have used this plural form for the express purpose of clearing up any difficulty in regard to his meaning. Gesenius refers to it for the same purpose, to demonstrate that the prophet must have referred to some collective body - as the prophets - and not to an individual. Aben Ezra and Abarbanel also maintain the same thing, and defend the position that it can never be applied to an individual. This is not the place to go into an extended examination of this word. The difficulties which have been started in regard to it, have given rise to a thorough critical examination of the use of the particle in the Old Testament, and an inquiry whether it is ever used in the singular number. Those who are disposed to see the process and the result of the investigation, may consult Ewald's Hebrew Grammar, Leipzig, 1827, p. 365; Wiseman's Lectures, pp. 331-333, Andover Edit., 1837; and Hengstenberg's Christology, p. 523. In favor of regarding it as used here in the singular number and as denoting an individual, we may just refer to the following considerations:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Rather, "He was taken away (that is, cut off) by oppression and by a judicial sentence"; a hendiadys for, "by an oppressive judicial sentence" [Lowth and Hengstenberg]. Gesenius not so well, "He was delivered from oppression and punishment" only by death. English Version also translates, "from &#8230; from," not "by &#8230; by." But "prison" is not true of Jesus, who was not incarcerated; restraint and bonds (Joh 18:24) more accord with the Hebrew. Ac 8:33; translate as the Septuagint: "In His humiliation His judgment (legal trial) was taken away"; the virtual sense of the Hebrew as rendered by Lowth and sanctioned by the inspired writer of Acts; He was treated as one so mean that a fair trial was denied Him (Mt 26:59; Mr 14:55-59). Horsley translates, "After condemnation and judgment He was accepted."<p>who &#8230; declare &#8230; generation&#8212;who can set forth (the wickedness of) His generation? that is, of His contemporaries [Alford on Ac 8:33], which suits best the parallelism, "the wickedness of His generation" corresponding to "oppressive judgment." But Luther, "His length of life," that is, there shall be no end of His future days (Isa 53:10; Ro 6:9). Calvin includes the days of His Church, which is inseparable from Himself. Hengstenberg, "His posterity." He, indeed, shall be cut off, but His race shall be so numerous that none can fully declare it. Chyrsostom, &c., "His eternal sonship and miraculous incarnation."<p>cut off&#8212;implying a violent death (Da 9:26).<p>my people&#8212;Isaiah, including himself among them by the word "my" [Hengstenberg]. Rather, Jehovah speaks in the person of His prophet, "My people," by the election of grace (Heb 2:13).<p>was he stricken&#8212;Hebrew, "the stroke (was laid) upon Him." Gesenius says the Hebrew means "them"; the collective body, whether of the prophets or people, to which the Jews refer the whole prophecy. But Jerome, the Syriac, and Ethiopiac versions translate it "Him"; so it is singular in some passages; Ps 11:7, His; Job 27:23, Him; Isa 44:15, thereto. The Septuagint, the Hebrew, lamo, "upon Him," read the similar words, lamuth, "unto death," which would at once set aside the Jewish interpretation, "upon them." Origen, who laboriously compared the Hebrew with the Septuagint, so read it, and urged it against the Jews of his day, who would have denied it to be the true reading if the word had not then really so stood in the Hebrew text [Lowth]. If his sole authority be thought insufficient, perhaps lamo may imply that Messiah was the representative of the collective body of all men; hence the equivocal plural-singular form.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He was taken from prison and from judgment:</span> these words are understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

After he had suffered and died, and made satisfaction to divine justice; or after he had been arrested by the justice of God, and was laid in prison, and under a sentence of condemnation, had judgment passed upon him, and that executed too; he was taken in a very little time from the prison of the grave where he lay, and from the state of condemnation into which he was brought, and was acquitted, justified, and declared righteous, and his people in him; a messenger was sent from heaven to roll away the stone, and set him free: though some render it, <p>he was taken by distress and judgment; that is, his life was taken away in a violent manner, under a pretence of justice; whereas the utmost injustice was done him; a wrong charge was brought against him, false witnesses were suborned, and his life was taken away with wicked hands; which sense seems to be favoured by the quotation in <a href="/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a> "in his humiliation his judgment was taken away": he had not common justice done him: <p>and who shall declare his generation? which is not to be understood of his divine generation, as the Son of God, which is in a way ineffable and inconceivable; nor of his human generation, as the Son of Man, which is unaccountable, being born of a virgin; nor of the duration of his life after his resurrection, he dying no more, but living for ever, which is more probable; nor of the vast number of his spiritual offspring, the fruit of his sufferings, death, and resurrection; but of the age, and men of it, in which he lived, whose barbarity to him, and wickedness they were guilty of, were such as could not be declared by the mouth, or described by the pen of man. The Targum is, <p>"and the wonderful things which shall be done for us in his days, who can declare?'' <p>for he was cut off out of the land of the living; was not suffered to live, was taken off by a violent death; he was cut off in a judiciary way, as if he had been a malefactor; though lest it should be thought it was for his own sins he was cut off, which is denied, <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a> it is added, <p>for the transgression of my people was he stricken; that is, either through the malice and wickedness of the people of the Jews, whom the prophet calls his people, he was stricken, not only with the scourges of the whip, but with death itself, as the efficient cause thereof; or rather because of the transgressions of God's elect, in order to make satisfaction for them, he was stricken by divine justice, and put to death, as the meritorious cause thereof; and so they are the words of God the Father; and this, with the preceding clause, give a reason, showing both why he was taken from the prison of the grave, acquitted, and exalted, and why the wickedness of his age could not be declared; he being stricken and cut off in such a manner, when he was an innocent person; and since it was only for the transgressions of others, even of God's covenant people, the people he chose, and gave to Christ, <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/53.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He was taken from <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> prison and from judgment: <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</span><p>(l) From the cross and grave, after that he was condemned.<p>(m) Though he died for sin, yet after his resurrection he will live forever and this his death is to restore life to his members, Ro 6:9.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/53.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">He was taken from prison and from judgment</span>] Every word here is ambiguous. The principal interpretations are as follows: (1) “Without hindrance and without right he was taken away,” i.e. he was put to death without opposition from any quarter, and in defiance of justice. The only exception that can fairly be taken to this view is the translation “hindrance,” a sense of the noun for which there are no parallels. Yet the verb from which the noun is derived occurs in the sense of “detain” (<a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm" title="And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there rises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down that the rain stop you not.">1 Kings 18:44</a>, &c.), and as the noun is very uncommon, the rendering cannot be pronounced impossible. (2) “Through oppression and through judgement he was taken away” (so virtually R.V.). “Judgement” here means “judicial procedure,” and the rendering “oppression” is guaranteed by <a href="/psalms/107-39.htm" title="Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.">Psalm 107:39</a>. “Oppression and judgement” may mean (as explained by Cheyne) an oppressive judgement (“through distressful doom,” see his <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, p. 428), the idea being that the Servant’s death, like that of our Lord, was a judicial murder. For “taken away” in the sense of “put to death” see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm" title="Now therefore, what have I here, said the LORD, that my people is taken away for nothing? they that rule over them make them to howl, said the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.">Isaiah 52:5</a>, and cf. <a href="/ezekiel/33-4.htm" title="Then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be on his own head.">Ezekiel 33:4</a> (where, however, a different part of the verb is used). (3) “From oppression and from judgement he was taken away,” i.e. released by death, or taken by God to Himself (<a href="/2_kings/2-10.htm" title="And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.">2 Kings 2:10</a>). Here the sense of “oppression and judgement” is indeterminate; the meaning might either be simply that by death he was finally released from his troubles, or that God took him away from the malice of his persecutors. The rendering “imprisonment” instead of “oppression” could be justified from the usage of the verb (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2 Kings 17:4</a> &c.), although not of the noun itself; only in this case we must not read, “From imprisonment … he was led away (to execution),” for that is an idea which could hardly have suggested itself apart from the fulfilment of the prophecy in the crucifixion of Christ. Of the three interpretations the last seems the most natural, although everything turns on the question whether the death of the Servant is conceived as caused directly by men or by God through sickness. (see below on the last clause of this verse.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And who shall declare his generation</span>?] A still more difficult clause. The Hebr. word for “generation” (<span class="ital">dôr</span>) may mean (<span class="ital">a</span>) the time in which he lived, (<span class="ital">b</span>) the circle of his contemporaries, (<span class="ital">c</span>) those like-minded with him (<a href="/psalms/12-7.htm" title="You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve them from this generation for ever.">Psalm 12:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-11.htm" title="There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.">Proverbs 30:11</a> ff.); but is never used with any such significance as “length of life,” or “life-history,” or “posterity.” In neither of its three senses does it supply a suitable object to the verb <span class="ital">declare</span> or rather <span class="bld">consider</span> (<a href="/psalms/143-5.htm" title="I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your works; I muse on the work of your hands.">Psalm 143:5</a> “meditate”). We may, however, take it in the sense (<span class="ital">b</span>), and render with R.V. <span class="bld">and as for his generation who (among them) considered</span> &c. (On this construction see Davidson, <span class="ital">Synt.</span> § 72, Rem. 4). Yet the construction as direct obj. of the verb is so much the more natural that any suggestion would be acceptable which might enable us to retain it. Duhm (following Knobel) takes the word in its Aramaic sense of “dwelling-place” (see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm" title="My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:12</a>) and translates “who enquires after his dwelling-place” (with God)? It would be better, perhaps, to understand “dwelling-place” exactly as in <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm" title="My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:12</a>, of the earthly dwelling-place, the place that once knew him but knows him no more: “Who enquires after it, or thinks about it?” <span class="bld">he has</span> vanished from the thoughts of men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he was cut off</span> (<a href="/psalms/88-5.htm" title="Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more: and they are cut off from your hand.">Psalm 88:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm" title="Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.">Ezekiel 37:11</a>) <span class="ital">out of the land of the living</span>] Comp. again <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm" title="But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.">Jeremiah 11:19</a>. The R.V. makes this clause an object sentence governed by the verb “considered” (reading <span class="ital">that</span> instead of <span class="ital">for</span>). This is perhaps necessary if the R.V. rendering of the previous line be adopted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the</span> <span class="bld">rebellion</span> <span class="ital">of my people was he stricken</span> (lit. “(was) a stroke upon him”)] The last word in the Hebr. (<span class="greekheb">לָמוֹ</span>) would be translated most naturally “upon them” (but see Davidson, <span class="ital">Gram.</span> § 19 R. <span class="ital">c.</span>); hence some render “because of the rebellion of my people, <span class="ital">the stroke</span> (<span class="ital">due</span>) <span class="ital">to them</span>.” A far more satisfactory sense is obtained by the help of the LXX. Read <span class="greekheb">למות</span> and change the preceding noun into a passive verb (<span class="ital">nugga‘</span> for <span class="ital">nega‘</span>) and render <span class="bld">was he stricken unto death</span>. The expression “stricken” is from the same verb which in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a></span> suggested leprosy as the cause of the Servant’s disfigurement; and its use here in connexion with his death is in favour of the view that he died of his sickness and not by the hands of his persecutors. If this conclusion be sound it confirms the view expressed above as to the sense of the first clause of this verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was taken from prison and from judgment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by oppression and a judgment was he taken away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (us Dr. Kay says) "by a violence which cloaked itself under the formalities of a legal process." The Septuagint Version, which is quoted by Philip the deacon in the Acts (Isaiah 8:33), must have been derived from quite a different text.

The sentiment is the same as in ver. 5, but with the difference that there it was suffering only, here it is death itself, which the Servant endures for man. "My people" may be either "God's people" or "the prophet's people," according as the speaker is regarded as Isaiah or Jehovah. Jehovah certainly becomes the Speaker in vers. 11, 12. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/53.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The confession, which follows, grows out of the great lamentation depicted by Zechariah in <a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>. "And he sprang up like a layer-shoot before Him, and like a root-sprout out of dry ground: he had no form, and no beauty; and we looked, and there was no look, such that we could have found pleasure in him." <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, as a sequel to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, looks back to the past, and describes how the arm of Jehovah manifested itself in the servant's course of life from the very beginning, though imperceptibly at first, and unobserved by those who merely noticed the outside. The suffix of &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; cannot refer to the subject of the interrogative sentence, as Hahn and Hofmann suppose, for the answer to the quis there is nemo; it relates to Jehovah, by which it is immediately preceded. Before Jehovah, namely, so that He, whose counsel thus began to be fulfilled, fixed His eye upon him with watchfulness and protecting care, he grew up &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;, like the suckling, i.e., (in a horticultural sense) the tender twig which sucks up its nourishment from the root and stem (not as Hitzig supposes, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>, from the moisture in the soil); for the tender twig upon a tree, or trunk, or stalk, is called &#1497;&#1504;&#1511;&#1514; (for which we have &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511; here): vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>, the twig of a cedar; <a href="/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a> (11), of a vine; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16</a>, of a liana. It is thought of here as a layer, as in <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>; and, indeed, as the second figure shows when taken in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, as having been laid down after the proud cedar of the Davidic monarchy from which it sprang had been felled; for elsewhere it is compared to a shoot which springs from the root left in the ground after the tree has been felled. Both figures depict the lowly and unattractive character of the small though vigorous beginning. The expression "out of dry ground," which belongs to both figures, brings out, in addition, the miserable character of the external circumstances in the midst of which the birth and growth of the servant had taken place. The "dry ground" is the existing state of the enslaved and degraded nation; i.e., he was subject to all the conditions inseparable from a nation that had been given up to the power of the world, and was not only enduring all the consequent misery, but was in utter ignorance as to its cause; in a word, the dry ground is the corrupt character of the age. In what follows, the majority of the commentators have departed from the accents, and adopted the rendering, "he had no form and no beauty, that we should look at Him" (should have looked at Him), viz., with fixed looks that loved to dwell upon Him. This rendering was adopted by Symmachus and Vitringa (&#x3b9;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;; ut ipsum respiceremus). But Luther, Stier, and others, very properly adhere to the existing punctuation; since the other would lead us to expect &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; instead of &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, and the close reciprocal relation of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, which resembles a play upon the words, is entirely expunged. The meaning therefore is, "We saw Him, and there was nothing in His appearance to make us desire Him, or feel attracted by Him." The literal rendering of the Hebrew, with its lively method of transferring you into the precise situation, is ut concupisceremus eum (delectaremur eo); whereas, in our oriental style, we should rather have written ut concupivissemus, using the pluperfect instead of the imperfect, or the tense of the associated past.
