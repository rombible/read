Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now, therefore, what have I here? - In Babylon, referring to the captivity of the Jews there. The idea is, that a state of things existed there which demanded his interposition as really as it did when his people had been oppressed by the Egyptians, or by the Assyrian. His people had been taken away for nought; they were subject to cruel oppressions; and his own name was continually blasphemed. In this state of things, it is inferred, that he would certainly come to their rescue, and that his own perfections as well as their welfare demanded that he should interpose to redeem them. The phrase, 'what have I here?' is equivalent to saying, what shall I do? what am I properly called on to do? or what reason is there now in Babylon for my interposition to rescue my people? It is implied, that such was the state of things, that God felt that there was something that demanded his interposition.<p>That my people is taken away for nought - This was one thing existing in Babylon that demanded his interposition. His people had been made captive by the Chaldeans, and were now suffering under their oppressions. This had been done 'for nought;' that is, it had been done without any just claim. It was on their part a mere act of gross and severe oppression, and this demanded the interposition of a righteous God.<p>They that rule over them make them to howl - Lowth renders this, 'They that are lords over them make their boast of it.' Noyes renders it, 'And their tyrants exult.' The Septuagint renders it, 'My people are taken away for nought: wonder ye, and raise a mournful cry' (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  ololuzete). Jerome renders it, 'Their lords act unjustly, and they therefore howl when they are delivered to torments.' Aben Ezra supposes that by 'their lords' here, or those who rule over them, are meant the rulers of the Jewish people, and that the idea is, that they lament and howl over the calamities and oppressions of the people. But it is probable, after all, that our translators have given the true sense of the text, and that the idea is, that they were suffering such grievous oppressions in Babylon as to make them lift up the cry of lamentation and of grief. This was a reason why God should interpose as he had done in former times, and bring deliverance.<p>And my name continually every day is blasphemed - That is, in Babylon. The proud and oppressive Babylonians delight to add to the sorrows of the exiles by reproaching the name of their God, and by saying that he was unable to defend them and their city from ruin. This is the third reason why God would interpose to rescue them. The three reasons in this verse are, that they had been taken away for nought; that they were suffering grievous and painful oppression; and that the name of God was reproached. On all these accounts he felt that he had something to do in Babylon, and that his interposition was demanded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. what have I here&#8212;that is, what am I called on to do?

The main idea obviously is that the state of things described in what follows is not to be endured, being inconsistent with the honour of Jehovah. The formula “What is there to me?” expresses a strong sense of incongruity between what is and what ought to be (see <a href="/isaiah/3-15.htm" title="What mean you that you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? said the Lord GOD of hosts.">Isaiah 3:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm" title="The burden of the valley of vision.

What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?">Isaiah 22:1</a>) here (in Babylonia)?” or, more generally, “What do I find here?” i.e. in the existing position of affairs, as contrasted with the historic parallels in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/52-4.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.">Isaiah 52:4</a></span>. The last is perhaps to be preferred. The meaning can hardly be, “What have I to do here (ch. <a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>) now that my people is taken away?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> (better <span class="bld">for</span>) <span class="ital">my people is taken away</span>] destroyed outright (ch. <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they that rule over them</span> (the Chaldæans) <span class="ital">make</span> them <span class="ital">to howl</span> (R.V. <span class="bld">do howl</span>)] The R.V. rightly avoids the causative sense of the verb, which has no support in usage. On the other hand, it is nowhere else used of a shout of exultation, as it must be here; comp. with Gesenius and others, “laetis <span class="ital">ululare</span> triumphis” (Lucan, 6, 261). In Syriac also the word appears occasionally to undergo a similar modification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my name … is blasphemed</span>] lit. <span class="bld">despised</span>. (The form should probably be pointed as part. Pual.) The meaning is that the calamities of Israel were attributed by the heathen to the impotence of their God, and thus the majesty of Jehovah was impaired,—a thought frequently expressed by Ezekiel (see <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm" title="And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.">Ezekiel 36:20</a> &c.).

Cruel taskmasters vexed the captives by insulting their God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Just as we found above, that the exclamation "awake" (&#8219;u&#772;r&#305;&#772;), which the church addresses to the arm of Jehovah, grew out of the preceding great promises; so here there grows out of the same another "awake" (hith&#8219;o&#772;rer&#305;&#772;), which the prophet addresses to Jerusalem in the name of his God, and the reason for which is given in the form of new promises. "Wake thyself up, wake thyself up, stand up, O Jerusalem, thou that hast drunk out of the hand of Jehovah the goblet of His fury: the goblet cup of reeling hast thou drunk, sipped out. There was none who guided her of all the children that she had brought forth; and none who took her by the hand of all the children that she had brought up. There were two things that happened to thee; who should console thee? Devastation, and ruin, and famine, and the sword: how should I comfort thee? Thy children were benighted, lay at the corners of all the streets like a snared antelope: as those who were full of the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God. Therefore hearken to this, O wretched and drunken, but not with wine: Thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, and thy God that defendeth His people, Behold, I take out of thine hand the goblet of reeling, the goblet cup of my fury: thou shalt not continue to drink it any more. And I put it into the hand of thy tormentors; who said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou madest thy back like the ground, and like a public way for those who go over it." In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, Jerusalem is regarded as a woman lying on the ground in the sleep of faintness and stupefaction. She has been obliged to drink, for her punishment, the goblet filled with the fury of the wrath of God, the goblet which throws those who drink it into unconscious reeling; and this goblet, which is called qubba&#8219;ath ko&#772;s (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, a genitive construction, though appositional in sense), for the purpose of giving greater prominence to its swelling sides, she has not only had to drink, but to drain quite clean (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>, and more especially <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-32.htm">Ezekiel 23:32-34</a>). Observe the plaintive falling of the tone in sha&#770;th&#305;&#772;th ma&#770;ts&#305;&#772;th. In this state of unconscious stupefaction was Jerusalem lying, without any help on the part of her children; there was not one who came to guide the stupefied one, or took her by the hand to lift her up. The consciousness of the punishment that their sins had deserved, and the greatness of the sufferings that the punishment had brought, pressed so heavily upon all the members of the congregation, that not one of them showed the requisite cheerfulness and strength to rise up on her behalf, so as to make her fate at any rate tolerable to her, and ward off the worst calamities. What elegiac music we have here in the deep cadences: mikkol-ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m ya&#770;la&#770;da&#770;h, mikkol-ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m gidde&#772;la&#770;h! So terrible was her calamity, that no one ventured to break the silence of the terror, or give expression to their sympathy. Even the prophet, humanly speaking, is obliged to exclaim, "How (m&#305;&#772;, literally as who, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a>, <a href="/amos/7-5.htm">Amos 7:5</a>) should I comfort thee!" He knew of no equal or greater calamity, to which he could point Jerusalem, according to the principle which experience confirms, solamen miseris socios habuisse malorum. This is the real explanation, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>, though we must not therefore take m&#305;&#772; as an accusative  equals  bem&#305;&#772;, as Hitzig does. The whole of the group is in the tone of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. There were two kinds of things (i.e., two kinds of evils: mishpa&#770;cho&#772;th, as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>) that had happened to her (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, with which it is used interchangeably even in the Pentateuch) - namely, the devastation and ruin of their city and their land, famine and the sword to her children, their inhabitants. <p>In <a href="/isaiah/51-20.htm">Isaiah 51:20</a> this is depicted with special reference to the famine. Her children were veiled (&#8219;ullaph, deliquium pati, lit., obvelari), and lay in a state of unconsciousness like corpses at the corner of every street, where this horrible spectacle presented itself on every hand. They lay ketho' mikhma&#770;r (rendered strangely and with very bad taste in the lxx, viz., like a half-cooked turnip; but given correctly by Jerome, sicut oryx, as in the lxx at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-5.htm">Deuteronomy 14:5</a>, illaqueatus), i.e., like a netted antelope (see at <a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9</a>), i.e., one that has been taken in a hunter's net and lies there exhausted, after having almost strangled itself by ineffectual attempts to release itself. The appositional &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, which refers to &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, gives as a quippe qui the reason for all this suffering. It is the punishment decreed by God, which has pierced their very heart, and got them completely in its power. This clause assigning the reason, shows that the expression "thy children" (ba&#770;nayikh) is not to be taken here in the same manner as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-4</a>, viz., as referring to children in distinction from adults; the subject is a general one, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>. With la&#770;khe&#772;&#772;n (therefore, <a href="/isaiah/51-21.htm">Isaiah 51:21</a>) the address turns from the picture of sufferings to the promise, in the view of which the cry was uttered, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, to awake and arise. Therefore, viz., because she had endured the full measure of God's wrath, she is to hear what His mercy, that has now begun to move, purposes to do. The connecting form shekhurath stands here, according to Ges. 116, 1, notwithstanding the (epexegetical) Vav which comes between. We may see from <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a> how thoroughly this "drunk, but not with wine," is in Isaiah's own style (from this distinction between a higher and lower sphere of related facts, compare <a href="/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>). The intensive plural 'a&#774;do&#772;n&#305;&#772;m is only applied to human lords in other places in the book of Isaiah; but in this passage, in which Jerusalem is described as a woman, it is used once of Jehovah. Ya&#770;r&#305;&#772;bh &#8219;ammo&#772; is an attributive clause, signifying "who conducts the cause of His people," i.e., their advocate or defender. He takes the goblet of reeling and wrath, which Jerusalem has emptied, for ever out of her hand, and forces it newly filled upon her tormentors. There is no ground whatever for reading &#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; (from &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, to throw down, related to &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, whence comes &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, a precipitate or sediment) in the place of &#1502;&#1493;&#1490;&#1497; (pret. hi. of &#1497;&#1490;&#1492;, (laborare, dolere), that favourite word of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>), the tone of which we recognise here throughout, as Lowth, Ewald, and Umbreit propose after the Targum &#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; &#1491;&#1492;&#1493;&#1493;. The words attributed to the enemies, shech&#305;&#772; vena&#8219;a&#774;bhora&#770;h (from sha&#770;cha&#770;h, the kal of which only occurs here), are to be understood figuratively, as in <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>. Jerusalem has been obliged to let her children be degraded into the defenceless objects of despotic tyranny and caprice, both at home in their own conquered country, and abroad in exile. But the relation is reversed now. Jerusalem is delivered, after having been punished, and the instruments of her punishment are given up to the punishment which their pride deserved. </body></html>
