They are not to plunder or carry off spoil that would render them unclean. They are to bring only “the vessels of Jehovah,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the gold and silver which had been taken from His temple, and which Cyrus restored by them (<a href="/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>). In this case the bearers are the Levites. Commonly, however, the phrase is used of “armour-bearers,” and this meaning is given to it by many commentators, as pointing to the whole body of the people as filling that function for the great king (<a href="/context/1_kings/14-27.htm" title="And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.">1Kings 14:27-28</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/52.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>MARCHING ORDERS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">CLEAN CARRIERS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm" title="Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the middle of her; be you clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.">Isaiah 52:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The context points to a great deliverance. It is a good example of the prophetical habit of casting prophecies of the future into the mould of the past. The features of the Exodus are repeated, but some of them are set aside. This deliverance, whatever it be, is to be after the pattern of that old story, but with very significant differences. Then, the departing Israelites had spoiled the Egyptians and come out, laden with silver and gold which had been poured into their hands; now there is to be no bringing out of anything which was tainted with the foulness of the land of captivity. Then the priests had borne the sacred vessels for sacrifice, now they are to exercise the same holy function, and for its discharge purity is demanded. Then, they had gone out in haste; now, there is to be no precipitate flight, but calmly, as those who are guided by God for their leader, and shielded from all pursuit by God as their rearward, the men of this new Exodus are to take their march from the new Egypt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No doubt the nearest fulfilment is to be found in the Return from Babylon, and the narrative in Ezra may be taken as a remarkable parallel to the prophecy here. But the restriction to Babylon must seem impossible to any reader who interprets aright the significance of the context, and observes that our text follows the grand words of verse 10, and precedes the Messianic prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> and of <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm" title="Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?">Isaiah 53:1</a> - <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. To such a reader the principle will not be doubtful according to which Egypt and Babylon are transparencies through which mightier forms shine, and a more wonderful and world-wide making bare of the arm of the Lord is seen. Christ’s great redemption is the highest interpretation of these words; and the trumpet-call of our text is addressed to all who have become partakers of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So Paul quotes the text in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="Why come out from among them, and be you separate, said the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, blending with it other words which are gathered from more than one passage of Scripture. We may then take the whole as giving the laws of the new Exodus, and also as shadowing certain great peculiarities connected with it, by which it surpasses all the former deliverances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Pilgrims of this new Exodus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>A true Christian is a pilgrim, not only because he, like all men, is passing through a life which is transient, but because he is consciously detached from the Visible and Present, as a consequence of his conscious attachment to the Unseen and Eternal. What is said in Hebrews of Abraham is true of all inheritors of his faith: ‘dwelling in tabernacles, for he looked for the city.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Priests and Levites bore the sacred vessels. All Christians are priests. The only true priesthood is Christ’s, ours is derived from Him. In that universal priesthood of believers are included the privileges and obligations of a. Access to God-Communion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b. Offering spiritual sacrifices. Service and self-surrender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c. Mediation with men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Proclamation. Intercession. Thus follows d. Bearing the holy vessels. A sacred deposit is entrusted to them-the honour and name of God; the treasure of the Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The separation that becomes pilgrims.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Come out and be ye separate.’ The very meaning of our Christian profession is separation. There is ludicrous inconsistency in saying that we are Christians and not being pilgrims. Of course, the separation is not to be worked out by mere external asceticism or withdrawal from the world. That has been so thoroughly preached and practised of late years that we much need the other side to be put. There should be some plain difference between the life of Christians and that of men whose portion is in this life. They should differ in the aspect under which all outward things are regarded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To a Christian they are to be means to an end, and ever to be felt to be evanescent. They should differ in the motive for action, which should, for a Christian, ever be the love of God. They should differ in that a Christian abstains from much which non-Christians feel free to do, and often has to say, ‘So did not I, because of the fear of the Lord.’ He who marches light marches quickly and marches far; to bring the treasures of Egypt along with us, is apt to retard our steps.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The purity that becomes priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Levites would cleanse themselves before taking up the holy vessels. And for us, clean hands and a pure heart are essential. There is no communion with God without these; a small speck of dust in the eye blinds us. There is no sacrificial service without them. No efficient work among men can be done without them. One main cause of the weakness of our Christian testimony is the imperfection of character in the witnesses, which is more powerful than all talk and often neutralises much effort. Keen eyes are watching us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The consciousness of our own impurity should send us to Jesus, with the prayer and the confidence, ‘Cleanse me and I shall be clean.’ ‘The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.’ ‘He hath loosed us from our sins and made us kings and priests to God.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/52.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/52-11.htm" title="Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the middle of her; be you clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD....">Isaiah 52:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Depart ye, go ye out from thence — </span>Out of Babylon into your own land, that there I may meet with you, and bless you, and perform those further and greater things for you which I have promised to do there. And this invitation was the more necessary, because God foresaw that a great number of the Jews would, upon worldly considerations, continue in those foreign countries in which they were settled, and would be very backward to return to the Holy Land. <span class="ital">Touch no unclean thing </span>— Carry not along with you any of their superstitions or idolatries. <span class="ital">Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord </span>— And especially you priests and Levites, who minister in holy things, and carry the holy vessels of the temple, keep yourselves from all pollution. <span class="ital">Ye shall not go out by flight </span>— But securely, and in triumph, being conducted by your great captain, the Lord of hosts. <span class="ital">The God of Israel will be your rereward </span>— So that none shall be able either to oppose you in your march, or to fall upon you in the rear.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>52:1-12 The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Depart ye, depart ye - This is a direct address to the exiles in their captivity. The same command occurs in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a> (see the notes on that place). It is repeated here for the sake of emphasis; and the urgency of the command implies that there was some delay likely to be apprehended on the part of the exiles themselves. The fact seems to have been, that though the captivity was at first attended with every circumstance suited to give pain, and though they were subjected to many privations and sorrows in Babylon (see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-9</a>), yet that many of them became strongly attached to a residence there, and were strongly indisposed to return. They were there seventy years. Most of those who were made captive would have died before the close of the exile. Their children, who constituted the generation to whom the command to return would be addressed, would have known the land of their fathers only by report.<p>It was a distant land; and was to be reached only by a long and perilous journey across a pathless desert. They had been born in Babylon. It was their home; and there were the graves of their parents arid kindred. Some had been advanced to posts of office and honor: many, it is probable, had lands, and friends, and property in Babylon. The consequence would, therefore, be, that there would be strong reluctance on their part to leave the country of their exile, and to encounter the perils and trials incident to a return to their own land. It is not improbable, also, that many of them may have formed improper connections and attachments in that distant land, and that they would be unwilling to relinquish them, and return to the land of their fathers. It was necessary, therefore, that the most urgent commands should be addressed to them, and the strongest motives presented to them, to induce them to return to the country of their fathers. And after all, it is evident that but comparatively a small portion of the exile Jews ever were prevailed on to leave Babylon, and to adventure upon the perilous journey of a return to Zion.<p>Touch no unclean thing - Separate yourselves wholly from an idolatrous nation, and preserve yourselves pure. The apostle Paul <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17-18</a> has applied this to Christians, and uses it as expressing the obligation to come out from the world, and to be separate from all its influences. Babylon is regarded by the apostle as not an unapt emblem of the world, and the command to come out from her as not an improper expression of the obligation to the friends of the Redeemer to be separate from all that is evil. John Rev 18:4 has applied this passage also to denote the duty of true Christians to separate themselves from the mystical Babylon - the papal community - and not to be partaker of her sins. The passage is applied in both these instances, because Babylon, in Scripture language, is regarded as emblematic of whatever is oppressive, proud, arrogant, persecuting, impure, and abominable.<p>That bear the vessels of the Lord - That bear again to your own land the sacred vessels of the sanctuary. It is to be remembered that when the Jews were taken to Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar carried there all the sacred utensils of the temple, and that they were used in their festivals as common vessels in Babylon <a href="/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2-5</a>. These vessels Cyrus commanded to be again restored, when the exiles returned to their own land <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7-11</a>. They whose office it was to carry them, were the priests and Levites <a href="/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; and the command here pertains particularly to them. They were required to be holy; to feel the importance of their office, and to be separate from all that is evil. The passage has no original reference to ministers of the gospel, but the principle is implied that they who are appointed to serve God as his ministers in any way should be pure and holy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Not from Jerusalem, as some, for that is now said to be redeemed, and its waste places made joyful; but Babylon, even mystical Babylon. The Targum is, "be ye separated, be ye separated": and so the apostle, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>. It denotes a separation from the idolatrous church of Rome; and the exhortation is repeated, to hasten the thing, to urge the necessity of it, and point at the danger of delaying it; and it may be it may respect a two fold separation, one that has been already at the time of the Reformation, and another that will be just before the destruction of Babylon, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>, <p>go ye out from thence: not only protest against the false doctrines, idolatries, and superstitions of that apostate church, but entirely relinquish her communion: <p>touch no unclean thing; have no fellowship with her in any of her unclean and idolatrous actions, and bring none of her abominations along with you. It was the fault of the first reformers from Popery, that they brought so many of the impurities of the church of Rome along with them, which are retained to this day; in this last separation, care is to be taken, and will be taken, that those that come out keep clear of all her defilements; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>, <p>go ye out of the midst of her; which signifies much the same as before, and is repeated again and again, to show the importance of it: <p>be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord; not the vessels of the Lord's sanctuary, as the Targum, restored by Cyrus to the Jews, at their return from the Babylonish captivity, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a>, and so Jarchi interprets it of the priests and Levites that bore the vessels of the Lord in the wilderness; but Kimchi of the mercies and kindnesses of the Lord; Aben Ezra of the law: but it may much better be understood of the ministers of the Gospel, and of the treasure of the Gospel which they have in their earthen vessels; or the name of the Lord, which they are chosen vessels to bear and carry in the world; who ought to be pure from false doctrine, superstitious worship, and an evil conversation: though it may be applied to every Christian, since all true believers are priests under the Gospel dispensation; and as they bear the whole armour of God, and it is their duty to attend all the ordinances of the Gospel, they ought to have their conversation as becomes it.

"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye have been sold for nothing, and ye shall not be redeemed with silver. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, My people went down to Egypt in the beginning to dwell there as guests; and Asshur has oppressed it for nothing. And now, what have I to do here? saith Jehovah: for my people are taken away for nothing; their oppressors shriek, saith Jehovah, and my name is continually blasphemed all the day. Therefore my people shall learn my name; therefore, in that day, that I am He who saith, There am I." Ye have been sold (this is the meaning of <a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>); but this selling is merely a giving over to a foreign power, without the slightest advantage accusing to Him who had no other object in view than to cause them to atone for their sins (<a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>), and without any other people taking their place, and serving Him in their stead as an equivalent for the loss He sustained. And there would be no need of silver to purchase the favour of Him who had given them up, since a manifestation of divine power would be all that would be required (<a href="/isaiah/45-13.htm">Isaiah 45:13</a>). For whether Jehovah show Himself to Israel as the Righteous One or as the Gracious One, as a Judge or as a Redeemer, He always acts as the Absolute One, exalted above all earthly affairs, having no need to receive anything, but able to give everything. He receives no recompense, and gives none. Whether punishing or redeeming, He always guards His people's honour, proving Himself in the one case to be all-sufficient, and in the other almighty, but acting in both cases freely from Himself. <p>In the train of thought in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-4.htm">Isaiah 52:4-6</a> the reason is given for the general statement in <a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>. Israel went down to Egypt, the country of the Nile valley, with the innocent intention of sojourning, i.e., living as a guest (gu&#772;r) there in a foreign land; and yet (as we may supply from the next clause, according to the law of a self-completing parallelism) there it fell into the bondage of the Pharaohs, who, whilst they did not fear Jehovah, but rather despised Him, were merely the blind instruments of His will. Asshur then oppressed it bephes, i.e., not "at last" (ultimo tempore, as Hvernick renders it), but (as &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; is the synonym of &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) "for nothing," i.e., without having acquired any right to it, but rather serving in its unrighteousness simply as the blind instrument of the righteousness of Jehovah, who through the instrumentality of Asshur put an end first of all to the kingdom of Israel, and then to the kingdom of Judah. The two references to the Egyptian and Assyrian oppressions are expressed in as brief terms as possible. But with the words "now therefore" the prophecy passes on in a much more copious strain to the present oppression in Babylon. Jehovah inquires, Quid mihi hic (What have I to do here)? Hitzig supposes po&#772;h (here) to refer to heaven, in the sense of, "What pressing occupation have I here, that all this can take place without my interfering?" But such a question as this would be far more appropriate to the Zeus of the Greek comedy than to the Jehovah of prophecy. Knobel, who takes po&#772;h as referring to the captivity, in accordance with the context, gives a ridiculous turn to the question, viz., "What do I get here in Babylonia, from the fact that my people are carried off for nothing? Only loss." He observes himself that there is a certain wit in the question. But it would be silly rather than witty, if, after Jehovah had just stated that He had given up His people for nothing, the prophet represented Him as preparing to redeem it by asking, "What have I gained by it?" The question can have no other meaning, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a>, than "What have I to do here?" Jehovah is thought of as present with His people (cf., <a href="/genesis/46-4.htm">Genesis 46:4</a>), and means to inquire whether He shall continue this penal condition of exile any longer (Targum, Rashi, Rosenmller, Ewald, Stier, etc.). The question implies an intention to redeem Israel, and the reason for this intention is introduced with k&#305;&#772;. Israel is taken away (ablatus), viz., from its own native home, chinna&#770;m, i.e., without the Chaldeans having any human claim upon them whatever. The words &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;) are not to be rendered, "its singers lament," as Reutschi and Rosenmller maintain, since the singers of Israel are called mesho&#772;rer&#305;&#772;m; nor "its (Israel's) princes lament," as Vitringa and Hitzig supposed, since the people of the captivity, although they had still their national sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, had no other mo&#772;shel&#305;&#772;m than the Chaldean oppressors (<a href="/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>). It is the intolerable tyranny of the oppressors of His people, that Jehovah assigns in this sentence as the reason for His interposition, which cannot any longer be deferred. It is true that we do meet with he&#772;l&#305;&#772;l (of which we have the future here without any syncope of the first syllable) in other passages in the sense of ululare, as a cry of pain; but just as &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1512;&#1494;&#1495; signify a yelling utterance of either joy or pain, so heeliil may also be applied to the harsh shrieking of the capricious tyrants, like Lucan's laetis ululare triumphis, and the Syriac ailel, which is used to denote a war-cry and other noises as well. In connection with this proud and haughty bluster, there is also the practice of making Jehovah's name the butt of their incessant blasphemy: &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1509; is a part. hithpoel with an assimilated &#1514; and a pausal a&#772; for e&#772;, although it might also be a passive hithpoal (for the o&#772; in the middle syllable, compare &#1502;&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>; &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/52-6.htm">Isaiah 52:6</a> there follows the closing sentence of the whole train of thought: therefore His people are to get to learn His name, i.e., the self-manifestation of its God, who is so despised by the heathen; therefore la&#770;khe&#772;n repeated with emphasis, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>, and possibly min in <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>) in that day, the day of redemption, (supply "it shall get to learn") that "I am he who saith, Here am I," i.e., that He who has promised redemption is now present as the True and Omnipotent One to carry it into effect. </body></html>
