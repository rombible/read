These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? - Is this such a mode of fasting as I have appointed and as Iapprove?<p>A day for a man to afflict his soul? - Margin, 'To afflict his soul for a day.' The reading in the text is the more correct; and the idea is, that the pain and inconvenience experienced by the abstinence from food was not the end in view in fasting. This seems to have been the mistake which they made, that they supposed there was something meritorious in the very pain incurred by such abstinence. Is there not danger of this now? Do we not often feel that there is something meritorious in the very inconveniences which we suffer in our acts of self denial? The important idea in the passage before us is, that the pain and inconvenience which we may endure by the most rigid fasting are not meritorious in the sight of God. They are not that at which he aims by the appointment of fasting. He aims at justice, truth, benevolence, holiness <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>; and he esteems the act of fasting to be of value only as it will be the means of leading us to reflect on our faults, and to amend our lives.<p>Is it to bow down his head - A bulrush is the large reed that grows in marshy places. It is, says Johnson, without knots or joints. In the midst of water it grows luxuriantly, yet the stalk is not solid or compact like wood, and, being unsupported by joints, it easily bends over under its own weight. it thus becomes the emblem of a man bowed down with grief. Here it refers to the sanctimoniousness of a hypocrite when fasting - a man without real feeling who puts on an air of affected solemnity, and 'appears to others to fast.' Against that the Saviour warned his disciples, and directed them, when they fasted, to do it in their ordinary dress, and to maintain an aspect of cheerfulness <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17-18</a>. The hypocrites in the time of Isaiah seemed to have supposed that the object was gained if they assumed this affected seriousness. How much danger is there of this now! How often do even Christians assume, on all the more solemn occasions of religious observance, a forced sanctimoniousness of manner; a demure and dejected air; nay, an appearance of melancholy - which is often understood by the worm to be misanthropy, and which easily slides into misanthropy! Against this we should guard. Nothing more injures the cause of religion than sanctimoniousness, gloom, reserve, coldness, and the conduct and deportment which, whether right or wrong, will be construed by those around us as misanthropy. Be it not forgotten that the seriousness which religion produces is always consistent with cheerfulness, and is always accompanied by benevolence; and the moment we feel that our religious acts consist in merely bowing down the head like a bulrush, that moment we may be sure we shall do injury to all with whom we come in contact.<p>And to spread sackcloth and ashes under him - On the meaning of the word 'sackcloth,' see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. It was commonly worn around the loins in times of fasting and of any public or private calamity. It was also customary to sit on sackcloth, or to spread it under one either to lie on, or to kneel on in times of prayer, as an expression of humiliation. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3</a>, it is said. 'and many lay on sackcloth and ashes:' or, as it is in the margin, 'sackcloth and ashes were laid under many;' (compare <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>). A passage in Josephus strongly confirms this, in which he describes the deep concern of the Jews for the danger of Herod Agrippa, after having been stricken suddenly with a violent disorder in the theater of Caesarea. 'Upon the news of his danger, immediately the multitude, with their wives and children, "sitting upon sackcloth according to their country rites," prayed for the king; all places were filled with wailing and lamentation; while the king, who lay in an upper room, beholding the people below thus falling prostrate on the ground, could not himself refrain from tears' (Antiq. xix. 8. 2). We wear crape - but for a somewhat different object. With us it is a mere sign of grief; but the wearing of sackcloth or sitting on it was not a mere sign of grief, but was regarded as tending to produce humiliation and mortification. Ashes also were a symbol of grief and sorrow. The wearing of sackcloth was usually accompanied with ashes <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>, <a href="/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3</a>. Penitents, or those in affliction, either sat down on the ground in dust and ashes <a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>; <a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>; or they put ashes on their head <a href="/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a>; or they mingled ashes with their food <a href="/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>. The Greeks and the Romans had also the same custom of strewing themselves with ashes in mourning. Thus Homer (Iliad, xviii. 22), speaking of Achilles bewailing the death of Patroclus, says:<p>Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread<p>The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head,<p>His purple garments, and his golden hairs;<p>Those he deforms, and these he tears.<p>Laertes (Odys. xxiv. 315), shows his grief in the same manner:<p>Deep from his soul he sighed, and sorrowing spread<p>A cloud of ashes on his hoary head.<p>So Virgil (AEn. x. 844), speaking of the father of Lausus, who was brought to him wounded, says:<p>Canitiem immundo deformat pulvere.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. for a man to afflict his soul&#8212;The pain felt by abstinence is not the end to be sought, as if it were meritorious; it is of value only in so far as it leads us to amend our ways (Isa 58:6, 7).<p>bow &#8230; head &#8230; sackcloth&#8212;to affect the outward tokens, so as to "appear to men to fast" (Mt 6:17, 18; 1Ki 21:27; Es 4:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That I have chosen; </span> approve of, accept, or delight in, by a metonymy, because we delight in what we freely choose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A day for a man to afflict his soul; </span> or, to afflict his soul for a day.

The words of God in <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a> are introduced with an interpolated "inquit Jehova" (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, and the ellipsis in <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>); and what Jehovah effects by speaking thus is placed first in a determining participial clause: "Creating fruit (&#1504;&#1493;&#1489;  equals  &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1493;&#1489;, keri &#1504;&#1497;&#1489;) of the lips," &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (lxx, <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), i.e., not of His own lips, to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; would be inapplicable, but the offering of praise and thanksgiving springing from human lips (for the figure, see Psychol. p. 214, trans.; and on the root &#1504;&#1489;, to press upon forward): "Jehovah saith sha&#770;lo&#772;m, sha&#770;lo&#772;m," i.e., lasting and perfect peace (as in <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>), "be the portion of those of my people who are scattered far and near" (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a>; compare the application to heathen and Jews in <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>); "and I heal it" (viz., the nation, which, although scattered, is like one person in the sight of God). But the wicked, who persist in the alienation from God inherited from the fathers, are incapable of the peace which God brings to His people: they are like the sea in its tossed and stormy state (&#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; pausal third pers. as an attributive clause). As this cannot rest, and as its waters cast out slime and mud, so has their natural state become one of perpetual disturbance, leading to the uninterrupted production of unclean and ungodly thoughts, words, and works. Thus, then, there is no peace for them, saith my God. With these words, which have even a more pathetic sound here than in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>, the prophet seals the second book of his prophecies. The "wicked" referred to are not the heathen outside Israel, but the heathen, i.e., those estranged from God, within Israel itself. <p>The transition form the first to the second half of this closing prophecy is formed by &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>. In the second half, from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>, we find the accustomed style of our prophet; but in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9-57:11</a>a the style is so thoroughly different, that Ewald maintains that the prophet has here inserted in his book a fragment from some earlier writer of the time of Manasseh. But we regard this as very improbable. It is not required by what is stated concerning the prophets and shepherds, for the book of Ezekiel clearly shows that the prophets and shepherds of the captivity were thus debased. Still less does what is stated concerning the early death of the righteous require it; for the fundamental idea of the suffering servant of Jehovah, which is peculiar to the second book, is shadowed forth therein. Nor by what is affirmed as to the idolatrous conduct of the people; for in the very centre (<a href="/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>) the great mass of the people are reproached for their contemptuous treatment of the servants of Jehovah. Nor does the language itself force us to any such conjecture, for <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> also differs from the style met with elsewhere; and yet (although Ewald regards it as an earlier, borrowed fragment) it must be written by the author of the whole, since its grandest idea finds its fullest expression there. At the same time, we may assume that the prophet described the idolatry of the people under the influences of earlier models. If he had been a prophet of the captives after the time of Isaiah, he would have rested his prophecies on Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For just as <a href="/isaiah/51-18.htm">Isaiah 51:18</a>. has the ring of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, so does <a href="/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3</a>. resemble in many respects the earlier reproaches of Jeremiah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7-9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>, with the expression, "Should I rest satisfied with this?"); also <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> (&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a> ("upon lofty mountains and under green trees"); also the night scene in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>. </body></html>
