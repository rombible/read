These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord shall guide thee continually - Yahweh will go before you and will lead you always.<p>And satisfy thy soul in drought - (See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-18</a>). The word rendered 'drought' (Margin, 'droughts;' Hebrew, &#1510;&#1495;&#1510;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;  tsachetsa&#770;cho&#770;th) means "dry places" - places exposed to the intense heat of a burning sun and parched up for the want of moisture. The idea is, that God would provide for them as if in such places copious rains were to fall, or refreshing fountains to burst forth.<p>And make fat thy bones - Lowth, 'Shall renew thy strength.' Noyes, 'Strengthen thy bones.' Jerome renders it, 'Shall liberate thy bones.' The Septuagint 'Thy bones shall be made fat.' The idea is undoubtedly that of vigorous prosperity, and of strength. Job J<a href="/obadiah/21-24.htm">Obadiah 21:24</a> expresses a similar idea of a strong man dying:<p>'His watering places for flocks abound with milk,<p>And his bones are moist with marrow.'<p>For the propriety of this translation, which differs from the common version, see my notes on Job, in loc. The word used here (&#1495;&#1500;&#1509;  cha&#770;lats), however, does not often, if ever, denote to make fat. It rather means to be manful, active, brave, ready for war; and the idea here is, probably, derived from the preparation which is made for the active services of war, rather than that of being made fat.<p>And thou shalt be like a watered garden - Syriac, 'Like paradise.' This is a most beautiful image to denote continued prosperity and blessedness - an image that would be particularly striking in the East. The ideas of happiness in the Oriental world consisted much in pleasant gardens, running streams, and ever-flowing fountains, and nothing can more beautifully express the blessedness of the continued favor of the Almighty. The following extract from Campbell (African Light), may illustrate this passage: 'In a hot climate, where showers seldom fall, except in what is called the rainy season, the difference between a well and ill watered garden is most striking. I remember some gardens in Africa, where they could lead no water upon them, the plants were all stinted, sickly, or others completely gone, only the hole left where the faded plant had been. The sight was unpleasant, and caused gloom to appear in every countenance; they were pictures of desolation. But in other gardens, to which the owners could bring daily supplies of water from an overflowing fountain, causing it to traverse the garden, every plant had a green, healthy appearance, loaded with fruit, in different stages toward maturity, with fragrant scent proceeding from beds of lovely flowers; and all this produced by the virtue God hath put into the single article of water.'<p>Whose waters fail not - Margin, 'Lie,' or 'Deceive.' Hebrew, &#1499;&#1494;&#1489;  ka&#770;zab - 'Lie.' Waters or springs lie or deceive when they become dried up, or fail in the dry seasons of the year. They deceive the shepherd who expected to obtain water there for himself or his flock; they deceive the caravan which had traveled to the well-known fountain where it had been often refreshed, and where, it is now found, its waters are dried up, or lost in the sand. Hence, such a brook or fountain becomes an emblem of a false and deceitful friend <a href="/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a> :<p>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,<p>As the stream of brooks they pass away.<p>But in the supplies which God makes for his people there is no such deception. The fountains of pardon, peace, and joy are ever open and ever full. The streams of salvation are always flowing. The weary pilgrim may go there at any season of the year, and from any part of a desolate world, and find them always full, refreshing, and free. However far may be the pilgrimage to them from amidst the waste and burning climes of sin, however many come to slake their thirst, and however frequently they come, they find them always the same. They never fail; and they will continue to flow on to the end of time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. satisfy &#8230; in drought&#8212;(Isa 41:17, 18).

This work-holy delusion, behind which self-righteousness and unrighteousness were concealed, is met thus by Jehovah through His prophet: "Can such things as these pass for a fast that I have pleasure in, as a day for a man to afflict his soul? To bow down his head like a bulrush, and spread sackcloth and ashes under him - dost thou call this a fast and an acceptable day for Jehovah? Is not this a fast that I have pleasure in: To loose coils of wickedness, to untie the bands of the yoke, and for sending away the oppressed as free, and that ye break every kind of yoke? Is it not this, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to take the poor and houseless to thy home; when thou seest a naked man that thou clothest him, and dost not deny thyself before thine own flesh?" The true worship, which consists in works of merciful love to one's brethren, and its great promises are here placed in contrast with the false worship just described. &#1492;&#1499;&#1494;&#1492; points backwards: is such a fast as this a fast after Jehovah's mind, a day on which it can be said in truth that a man afflicts his soul (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>)? The &#1492; of &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1507; is resumed in &#1492;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492;; the second &#1500; is the object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; expressed as a dative. The first &#1500; answers to our preposition "to" with the infinitive, which stands here at the beginning like a casus absol. (to hang down; for which the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;&#1507; might also be used), and as in most other cases passes over into the finite (et quod saccum et cinerem substernit, viz., sibi: Ges. 132, Anm. 2). To hang down the head and sit in sackcloth and ashes - this does not in itself deserve the name of fasting and of a day of gracious reception (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>) on the part of Jehovah (&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; for a subjective genitive).<p><a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> affirm that the fasting which is pleasant to Jehovah consists in something very different from this, namely, in releasing the oppressed, and in kindness to the helpless; not in abstinence form eating as such, but in sympathetic acts of that self-denying love, which gives up bread or any other possession for the sake of doing good to the needy.<p>(Note: The ancient church connected fasting with almsgiving by law. Dressel, Patr. Ap. p. 493.)<p>There is a bitter irony in these words, just as when the ancients said, "not eating is a natural fast, but abstaining form sin is a spiritual fast." During the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans a general emancipation of the slaves of Israelitish descent (who were to be set free, according to the law, every three years) was resolved upon and carried out; but as soon as the Chaldeans were gone, the masters fetched their liberated slaves back into servitude again (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-22</a>). And as <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> shows, they carried the same selfish and despotic disposition with them into captivity. The &#1494;&#1492; which points forwards is expanded into infin. absolutes, which are carried on quite regularly in the finite tense. Mo&#772;ta&#770;h, which is repeated palindromically, signifies in both cases a yoke, lit., vectis, the cross wood which formed the most important part of the yoke, and which was fastened to the animal's head, and so connected with the plough by means of a cord or strap (Sir. 30:13; 33:27).<p>(Note: I have already observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>, in vindication of what was stated at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>, that the yoke was not in the form of a collar. I brought the subject under the notice of Prof. Schegg, who wrote to me immediately after his return from his journey to Palestine to the following effect: "I saw many oxen ploughing in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the neighbourhood of Ephesus; and in every case the yoke was a cross piece of wood laid upon the neck of the animal, and fastened to the pole of the plough by a cord which passed under the neck of the animal.")<p>It is to this that &#1488;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, knots, refers. We cannot connect it with mutteh, a state of perverted right (<a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>), as Hitzig does. &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; are persons unjustly and forcibly oppressed even with cruelty; &#1512;&#1510;&#1509; is a stronger synonym to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; (e.g., <a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> we have the same spirit of general humanity as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7-8</a> (compare what James describes in <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> as "pure religion and undefiled"). &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; (&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;) &#1508;&#1512;&#1509; is the usual phrase for &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is the adjective to &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and apparently therefore must be derived from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;: miserable men who have shown themselves refractory towards despotic rulers. But the participle ma&#770;ru&#772;d cannot be found elsewhere; and the recommendation to receive political fugitives has a modern look. The parallels in <a href="/lamentations/1-7.htm">Lamentations 1:7</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a> are conclusive evidence, that the word is intended as a derivative of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to wander about, and it is so rendered in the lxx, Targ., and Jerome (vagos). But &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;, pl. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, is no adjective; and there is nothing to recommend the opinion, that by "wanderers" we are to understand Israelitish men. Ewald supposes that &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; may be taken as a part. hoph. for &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, hunted away, like &#1492;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a> (Keri &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;); but it cannot be shown that the language allowed of this shifting of a vowel-sound. We prefer to assume that &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (persecuted) is regarded as part. pass., even if only per metaplasmum, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;, a secondary form of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (cf., &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1509;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1495;, makuna). <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> is still the virtual subject to &#1488;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501;. The apodosis to the hypothetical &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; commences with a perf. consec., which then passes into the pausal future &#1514;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;. In hsilgnE:egaugnaL\&&#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1498; (from thine own flesh) it is presupposed that all men form one united whole as being of the same flesh and blood, and that they form one family, owing to one another mutual love. </body></html>
