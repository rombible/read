For there are two parts of righteousness toward our neighbour; one, to do wrong to no man; the other, to do good to all: which two must always go together, and never be separated from each other, especially in acts and seasons of humiliation. And, as under the evils here mentioned are comprehended all other evils whatsoever, all which men must abstain from if they would give evidence of true humiliation and godly sorrow, so in the duties here spoken of are comprised all the duties, to the practice of which they ought to apply themselves as the effects of true repentance. <span class="ital">To deal </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">פרס</span>properly signifies <span class="ital">to divide, </span>or to break into parts; <span class="ital">thy bread to the hungry</span> — Bread is here put for all things necessary for the support of human life, any or every kind of food. <span class="ital">And that thou bring the poor </span>— Those that are not only needy, as to their present condition, but helpless, and utterly unable to support themselves; <span class="ital">that are cast out </span>— Forced from their dwellings, deprived of house and harbour by the injustice of the powerful, or by persecution for conscience’ sake, and who are thereby become wanderers, and have no abiding place; <span class="ital">to thy house </span>— That thou be hospitable, and make thy house a shelter to them, or provide lodging for them. <span class="ital">When thou seest the naked </span>— Those that either have no clothes, or are so poorly clothed that their clothing is not sufficient to preserve them from perishing by cold; <span class="ital">that thou cover him </span>— That thou give them raiment suited to these wants, <a href="/context/james/2-15.htm" title="If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,...">James 2:15-16</a>. <span class="ital">And that thou hide not thyself </span>— That thou not only seek no occasion to excuse thyself, but that, out of compassion, thou apply thyself heartily and speedily to his relief; that thou be not like the priest and Levite, but like the good Samaritan, <a href="/context/luke/10-31.htm" title="And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side....">Luke 10:31-35</a>. <span class="ital">From thine own flesh </span>— Some restrain this to our own kindred, but this would confine our charity within too narrow a compass, inasmuch as often, nay, perhaps most commonly, the necessities of others are greater than those of our own relations; neither is it congruous, that the other words here should be taken in the greatest latitude, and this alone be confined within such narrow limits.

These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry? - The word renderd 'deal' (&#1508;&#1512;&#1505;  pa&#770;ras), means to divide, to distribute. The idea is, that we are to apportion among the poor that which will be needful for their support, as a father does to his children. This is everywhere enjoined in the Bible, and was especially regarded among the Orientals as an indispensable duty of religion. Thus Job J<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/31-16.htm">Obadiah 31:16-22</a> beautifully speaks of his own practice:<p>If I have witheld the poor from his desire,<p>Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;<p>Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,<p>And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;<p>If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,<p>Or any poor without covering; - ...<p>Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,<p>And mine arm be broken from the bone.<p>And that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house - Margin, 'Afflicted' Hospitality to all, and especially to the friendless and the stranger, was one of the cardinal virtues in the Oriental code of morals. Lowth renders this, 'The wandering poor.'<p>When thou seest the naked ... - This duty is also plain, and is everywhere enjoined in the Bible (compare <a href="/matthew/25-38.htm">Matthew 25:38</a>).<p>And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh - That is, from thine own kindred or relations who are dependent on thee. Compare <a href="/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27</a>; where the word 'flesh' is used to denote near relations - relations as intimate and dear as if they were a part of our flesh and blood <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>. To hide oneself from them may denote either, first, to be ashamed of them on account of their poverty or humble rank in life; or, secondly, to witchold from them the just supply of their needs. Religion requires us to treat all our kindred, whatever may be their rank, with kindness and affection, and enjoins on us the duty of providing for the needs of those poor relatives who in the providence of God are made dependent on us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. deal&#8212;distribute (Job 31:16-21).<p>cast out&#8212;rather, reduced [Horsley].<p>naked &#8230; cover him&#8212;(Mt 25:36).<p>hide &#8230; thyself&#8212;means to be strange towards them, and not to relieve them in their poverty (Mt 15:5).<p>flesh&#8212;kindred (Ge 29:14).

The prophet receives the commission to appear as the preacher of condemnation; and whilst Jehovah is giving the reason for this commission, the preaching itself commences. "Cry with full throat, hold not back; lift up thy voice like a bugle, and proclaim to my people their apostasy, and to the house of Jacob their sins. And they seek me day by day, and desire to learn my ways, like a nation which has done righteousness, and has not forsaken the right of their God: they ask of me judgments of righteousness; they desire the drawing near of Elohim." As the second prophecy of the first part takes as its basis a text from Micah (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-4</a>), so have we here in <a href="/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a> the echo of <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. Not only with lisping lips (<a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>), but with the throat (<a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>); that is to say, with all the strength of the voice, lifting up the voice like the sho&#772;pha&#770;r (not a trumpet, which is called &#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, nor in fact any metallic instrument, but a bugle or signal horn, like that blown on new year's day: see at <a href="/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a>), i.e., in a shrill shouting tone. With a loud voice that must be heard, with the most unsparing publicity, the prophet is to point out to the people their deep moral wounds, which they may indeed hide from themselves with hypocritical opus operatum, but cannot conceal from the all-seeing God. The &#1493; of &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; does not stand for an explanatory particle, but for an adversative one: "their apostasy ... their sins; and yet (although they are to be punished for these) they approach Jehovah every day" (&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; with mahpach under the first &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, and pasek after it, as is the general rule between two like-sounding words), "that He would now speedily interpose." They also desire to know the ways which He intends to take for their deliverance, and by which He desires to lead them. This reminds us of the occurrence between Ezekiel and the elders of Gola (<a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>.; compare also <a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a>.). As if they had been a people whose rectitude of action and fidelity to the commands of God warranted them in expecting nothing but what was good in the future, they ask God (viz., in prayer and by inquiring of the prophet) for mishpete&#772; tsedeq, "righteous manifestations of judgment" i.e., such as will save them and destroy their foes, and desire qirbath 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m, the coming of God, i.e., His saving parousia. The energetic futures, with the tone upon the last syllable, answer to their self-righteous presumption; and &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is repeated, according to Isaiah's most favourite oratorical figure, at the close of the verse. </body></html>
