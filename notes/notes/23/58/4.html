Or the meaning is, that “their fasting increased their self-preference, and excited them to fierce controversies or bitter resentments.” <span class="ital">And to smite with the fist of wickedness </span>— It was “the cloak of, and commutation for, their exactions and oppressions of the poor, whom they most unjustly smote and abused for not complying in every thing with their inclinations.” — Scott. <span class="ital">Ye shall not fast as ye do this day </span>— Such a fast as this I cannot accept of as an act of worship, or bless as a means of grace. <span class="ital">To make your voice to be heard on high </span>— In strife and debate, or by way of ostentation. <span class="ital">Is it such a fast that I have chosen? — </span>That is, which I <span class="ital">approve of, accept, </span>or <span class="ital">delight in, </span>because we delight in what we freely choose. <span class="ital">A day for a man to afflict his soul </span>— To keep himself low, or to chastise himself by depriving his body of food, as a means to produce inward sorrow for sin, and true humiliation of soul before God. The prophet seems to have delivered this discourse upon, or to have intended it for, some extraordinary day of humiliation, when it was usual for the prophets to give public exhortations to the people. <span class="ital">Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush?</span> — Here the prophet notices those external gestures, postures, and signs of penitence, which the Jews of his time, and in after ages, (<a href="/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>,) joined with their hypocritical fasts. <span class="ital">And to spread sackcloth and ashes under him </span>— The Jews, to express their sorrow, made use of sackcloth and ashes two ways: 1st, Sometimes by putting sackcloth upon their bodies, as <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-11.htm" title="I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.">Psalm 69:11</a>; and casting ashes upon their heads, <a href="/2_samuel/13-19.htm" title="And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.">2 Samuel 13:19</a> : and, 2d, By spreading sackcloth under them, and lying down upon ashes, <a href="/esther/4-3.htm" title="And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.">Esther 4:3</a>; <a href="/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a>. The intent of putting on sackcloth was to afflict the body by its unpleasing harshness, and the ashes were meant to represent their own vileness, as being but dust and ashes; and their lying on them to signify that they abhorred and were ashamed of themselves. <span class="ital">Wilt thou call this a fast? </span>— Canst thou, upon rational grounds, believe or suppose it to be so? Surely it has nothing in it but the lifeless form, empty shadow, or dumb signs of a fast: nothing of deep humiliation appearing in it, or real reformation proceeding from it. Not that the prophet blames them for afflicting themselves by these external rites, for these are elsewhere commanded of God; but that which he condemns is their hypocrisy in separating true humiliation from them, and contenting themselves with using these signs, while they stopped short of the thing signified by them. <span class="ital">And an acceptable day to the Lord </span>— A day that God will approve of. Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ויום רצון</span>, <span class="ital">A day of acceptance, </span>or that will turn to a good account on your behalf.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>58:3-12 A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate - This is a third characteristic of their manner of fasting, and a third reason why God did not regard and accept it. They were divided into parties and factions, and probably made their fastings an occasion of augmented contention and strife. How often has this been seen! Contending denominations of Christians fast, not laying aside their strifes; contending factions in the church fast in order to strengthen their party with the solemn sanctions of religion. One of the most certain ways for bigots to excite persecution against those who are opposed to them is to 'proclaim a fast;' and when together, their passions are easily inflamed, their flagging zeal excited by inflammatory harangues, and their purpose formed to regard and treat their dissentient brethren as incorrigible heretics and irreconcilable foes. It may be added, also, that it is possible thus to prostitute all the sacred institutions of religion for party and inflammatory purposes. Even the ordinance of the Lord's Supper may be thus abused, and violent partisans may come around the sacred memorials of a Saviour's body and blood, to bind themselves more closely together in some deed of persecution or violence, and to animate their drooping courage with the belief that what has been in fact commenced with a view to power, is carried on from a regard to the honor of God.<p>And to smite with the fist of wickedness - Lowth renders this, in accordance with the Septuagint. 'To smite with the fist the poor;' but this translation can be obtained only by a most violent and wholly unauthorized change in the Hebrew text. The idea is plain, that 'even when fasting' they were guilty of strife and personal combats. Their passions were unsubdued, and they gave vent to them in disgraceful personal encounters. This manifests a most extraordinary state of society, and is a most melancholy instance to show how much people may keep up the forms of religion, and even be punctual and exact in them, when the most violent and ungovernable passions are raging in their bosoms, and when they seem to be unconscious of any discrepancy between the religious service and the unsubdued passions of the soul.<p>Ye shall not fast ... - It is not acceptable to God. It must be offensive in his sight.<p>To make your voice to be heard on high - That is, in strife and contention. So to contend and strive, says Grotius, that your voice can be heard on the mountain top. Rosenmuller, however, supposes that it means, that their fast was so conducted that they could not expect that their prayers would ascend to heaven and be heard by God. But it seems to me that the former is the correct interpretation. Their fastings were accompanied with the loud and hoarse voice of contention and strife, and on that account could not be acceptable to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. ye shall not fast&#8212;rather, "ye do not fast at this time, so as to make your voice to be heard on high," that is, in heaven; your aim in fasting is strife, not to gain the ear of God [Maurer] (1Ki 21:9, 12, 13).

"Creating fruit of the lips; Jehovah saith, 'Peace, peace to those that are far off, and to those that are near; and I heal it.' But the wicked are like the sea that is cast up for it cannot rest, and its waters cast out slime and mud. There is no peace, saith my God, for the wicked." The words of God in <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a> are introduced with an interpolated "inquit Jehova" (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, and the ellipsis in <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>); and what Jehovah effects by speaking thus is placed first in a determining participial clause: "Creating fruit (&#1504;&#1493;&#1489;  equals  &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1493;&#1489;, keri &#1504;&#1497;&#1489;) of the lips," &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (lxx, <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), i.e., not of His own lips, to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; would be inapplicable, but the offering of praise and thanksgiving springing from human lips (for the figure, see Psychol. p. 214, trans.; and on the root &#1504;&#1489;, to press upon forward): "Jehovah saith sha&#770;lo&#772;m, sha&#770;lo&#772;m," i.e., lasting and perfect peace (as in <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>), "be the portion of those of my people who are scattered far and near" (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a>; compare the application to heathen and Jews in <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>); "and I heal it" (viz., the nation, which, although scattered, is like one person in the sight of God). But the wicked, who persist in the alienation from God inherited from the fathers, are incapable of the peace which God brings to His people: they are like the sea in its tossed and stormy state (&#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; pausal third pers. as an attributive clause). As this cannot rest, and as its waters cast out slime and mud, so has their natural state become one of perpetual disturbance, leading to the uninterrupted production of unclean and ungodly thoughts, words, and works. Thus, then, there is no peace for them, saith my God. With these words, which have even a more pathetic sound here than in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>, the prophet seals the second book of his prophecies. The "wicked" referred to are not the heathen outside Israel, but the heathen, i.e., those estranged from God, within Israel itself. <p>The transition form the first to the second half of this closing prophecy is formed by &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>. In the second half, from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>, we find the accustomed style of our prophet; but in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9-57:11</a>a the style is so thoroughly different, that Ewald maintains that the prophet has here inserted in his book a fragment from some earlier writer of the time of Manasseh. But we regard this as very improbable. It is not required by what is stated concerning the prophets and shepherds, for the book of Ezekiel clearly shows that the prophets and shepherds of the captivity were thus debased. Still less does what is stated concerning the early death of the righteous require it; for the fundamental idea of the suffering servant of Jehovah, which is peculiar to the second book, is shadowed forth therein. Nor by what is affirmed as to the idolatrous conduct of the people; for in the very centre (<a href="/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>) the great mass of the people are reproached for their contemptuous treatment of the servants of Jehovah. Nor does the language itself force us to any such conjecture, for <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> also differs from the style met with elsewhere; and yet (although Ewald regards it as an earlier, borrowed fragment) it must be written by the author of the whole, since its grandest idea finds its fullest expression there. At the same time, we may assume that the prophet described the idolatry of the people under the influences of earlier models. If he had been a prophet of the captives after the time of Isaiah, he would have rested his prophecies on Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For just as <a href="/isaiah/51-18.htm">Isaiah 51:18</a>. has the ring of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, so does <a href="/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3</a>. resemble in many respects the earlier reproaches of Jeremiah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7-9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>, with the expression, "Should I rest satisfied with this?"); also <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> (&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a> ("upon lofty mountains and under green trees"); also the night scene in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>. </body></html>
