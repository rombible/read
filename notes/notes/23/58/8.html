These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shall thy light - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a>). The idea here is, that if they were faithful in the discharge of their duty to God, he would bless them with abundant prosperity (compare <a href="/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>). The image is, that such prosperity would come on the people like the spreading light of the morning.<p>And thine health - Lowth and Noyes render this, 'And thy wounds shall be speedily healed over.' The authority on which Lowth relies, is the version of Aquila as reported by Jerome, and the Chaldee. The Hebrew word used here, (&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;  'a&#774;ru&#770;ka&#770;h), means properly "a long bandage" (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;  'a&#770;rak, "to make long"), such as is applied by surgeons to heal a wound (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>). It is then used to denote the healing which is secured by the application of the bandage; and figuratively here means their restoration from all the calamities which had been inflicted on the nation. The word rendered 'spring forth' (from &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsa&#770;mach) properly relates to the manner in which plants germinate (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>). Here the sense is, that if they would return to God, they would be delivered from the calamities which their crimes had brought on them, and that peace and prosperity would again visit the nation.<p>And thy righteousness shall go before thee - Shall be thy leader - as an army is conducted. The idea is that their conformity to the divine laws would serve the purpose of a leader to conduct them in the ways of peace, happiness, and prosperity.<p>The glory of the Lord - The allusion here is doubtless to the mode in which the children of Israel came out of Egypt (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>Shall be thy rere-ward - Margin, 'Shall gather thee up.' That is, shall bring up the rear (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. light&#8212;emblem of prosperity (Isa 58:10; Job 11:17).<p>health&#8212;literally, a long bandage, applied by surgeons to heal a wound (compare Isa 1:6).

For such a notion as this was vulgarly sucked in, that adversity did never befall a person or people but for their sins, and was strongly urged by way of argument against Job’s integrity by his friends; therefore they being delivered shall be as a testimony of thy righteousness. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. The fruit and effect of thy righteousness, viz. the due, just, and right order of thy government, which, as Calvin saith, is a sign of God’s fatherly kindness; things that are now in a confusion he will bring into right order again, i.e. justice shall be duly administered, and men shall carry themselves justly all the land over: see <span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/32-16.htm" title="Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field....">Isaiah 32:16-18</a></span>.

This is to be understood best of temporal and spiritual prosperity, especially the latter, which will attend the churches of the Reformation, when a spirit of persecution is laid aside, and a spirit of love commences, which will be in the Philadelphian church state; and it particularly respects the glorious light of the Gospel, which will break forth very clearly, and shine out in all the world; and the light of joy, peace, and comfort, which will attend it, in the hearts of the Lord's people; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, <p>and thine health shall spring forth speedily; as the herbs and grass out of the earth, by clear shining after rain; by which is meant the healthful and sound state of the church in the latter day, when all divisions shall be healed; contentions and animosities cease; sound doctrine preached; the ordinances administered according to their original institution; true discipline restored; and all the parts of worship performed, according to the rule of the divine word; and so the souls of men, under all these means, be in thriving and flourishing circumstances: <p>and thy righteousness shall go before thee; not the external righteousness of the saints, or works of righteousness done by them; these do not go before them, at least to prepare the way for them into a future state of happiness, but follow after, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, rather the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and so theirs; or Christ their righteousness, the sun of righteousness, that arises upon them with healing in his wings, and from whom they have the health before mentioned; he goes before his people by way of example, as a guide to direct them, and as the forerunner of them, and whose righteousness will introduce them into the heavenly glory. Though perhaps the meaning here is, that their righteousness, in the latter day glory, shall be very manifest, both their righteousness before God, and before men; which will, as it were, visibly walk before them, make way for them, and protect them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, <p>and the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward, the glorious power and providence of God, preserving his people; or the glorious Lord himself, our Lord Jesus Christ, the brightness of his Father's glory, he, as the word may be rendered, "shall gather thee" (i); he gathers his people to himself; he protects and defends them; he takes care of the weak and feeble, and that are straggling behind; and he brings them up, being the reward, and saves them. The phrase denotes a glorious state of the church in the latter day, when the glory of the Lord will be risen on his church, and abide upon it, and upon all that glory there shall be a defence; see <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>. <p>(i) "colliget te", V.

The prophet receives the commission to appear as the preacher of condemnation; and whilst Jehovah is giving the reason for this commission, the preaching itself commences. "Cry with full throat, hold not back; lift up thy voice like a bugle, and proclaim to my people their apostasy, and to the house of Jacob their sins. And they seek me day by day, and desire to learn my ways, like a nation which has done righteousness, and has not forsaken the right of their God: they ask of me judgments of righteousness; they desire the drawing near of Elohim." As the second prophecy of the first part takes as its basis a text from Micah (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-4</a>), so have we here in <a href="/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a> the echo of <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. Not only with lisping lips (<a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>), but with the throat (<a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>); that is to say, with all the strength of the voice, lifting up the voice like the sho&#772;pha&#770;r (not a trumpet, which is called &#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, nor in fact any metallic instrument, but a bugle or signal horn, like that blown on new year's day: see at <a href="/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a>), i.e., in a shrill shouting tone. With a loud voice that must be heard, with the most unsparing publicity, the prophet is to point out to the people their deep moral wounds, which they may indeed hide from themselves with hypocritical opus operatum, but cannot conceal from the all-seeing God. The &#1493; of &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; does not stand for an explanatory particle, but for an adversative one: "their apostasy ... their sins; and yet (although they are to be punished for these) they approach Jehovah every day" (&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; with mahpach under the first &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, and pasek after it, as is the general rule between two like-sounding words), "that He would now speedily interpose." They also desire to know the ways which He intends to take for their deliverance, and by which He desires to lead them. This reminds us of the occurrence between Ezekiel and the elders of Gola (<a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>.; compare also <a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a>.). As if they had been a people whose rectitude of action and fidelity to the commands of God warranted them in expecting nothing but what was good in the future, they ask God (viz., in prayer and by inquiring of the prophet) for mishpete&#772; tsedeq, "righteous manifestations of judgment" i.e., such as will save them and destroy their foes, and desire qirbath 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m, the coming of God, i.e., His saving parousia. The energetic futures, with the tone upon the last syllable, answer to their self-righteous presumption; and &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is repeated, according to Isaiah's most favourite oratorical figure, at the close of the verse. </body></html>
