It is the great concern of those who have backslidden from God, like the Jews of old, to hasten their return to him. The work of redemption wrought for us by Christ, encourages to hope for all blessings from him. Our transgressions and our sins are as a thick cloud between heaven and earth: sins separate between us and God; they threaten a storm of wrath. When God pardons sin, he blots out, he dispels this cloud, this thick cloud, so that the way to heaven is open again. The cloud is scattered by the Sun of righteousness; it is quite gone. The comforts that flow into the soul when sin is pardoned, are like clear shining after clouds and rain. Let not Israel be discouraged; nothing is too hard for God: having made all, he can make what use he pleases of any. Those that learn to know Christ, see all knowledge to be foolishness, in comparison with the knowledge of him. And his enemies will find their counsels turned into foolishness, and themselves taken in their craftiness. The exact fulfilling the prophecies of Scripture confirms the truth of the whole, and proves its Divine origin. The particular favours God designed for his people in captivity, were foretold here, long before they went into captivity. Very great difficulties would be in the way of their deliverance; but it is promised that by Divine power they should all be removed. God knew who should be the Deliverer of his people; and let his church know it, that when they heard such a name talked of, they might know their redemption drew nigh. It is the greatest honour of the greatest men, to be employed as instruments of the Divine favour to his people. In things wherein men serve themselves, and look no further, God makes them do all his pleasure. And a nobler Shepherd than Cyrus does his Father's will, till his work is fully completed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember these - Remember these things which are now said about the folly of idolatry, and the vanity of worshipping idols.

Israel, having been exhorted never to forget the impotency of idols (ver. 21), is promised forgiveness and deliverance (vers. 21, 22). Then, heaven and earth are called upon to join in rejoicing over the announcement (ver. 23). Finally, in a noble burst of poetry, God is represented as solemnly declaring his intention of frustrating all the false sayings of the soothsayers concerning his people, and accomplishing their restoration to their own land, and the rebuilding of their temple through the instrumentality of Cyrus (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the futility of idols  and the folly of the idol-worshippers.

I have formed thee (so also in <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 21</a>; vers. 2, 24). The duty of absolute unquestioning obedience seems contained in the relation of that which is formed to that which has formed it. On the other hand, it may be assumed that he who has formed a thing will have a constant care of it and regard for it - that at any rate he will not "forget" it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet now traces the origin of the idols still further back. Their existence or non-existence ultimately depends upon whether it rains or not. "One prepares to cut down cedars, and takes holm and oak-tree, and chooses for himself among the trees of the forest. He has planted a fig, and the rain draws it up. And it serves the man for firing: he takes thereof, and warms himself; he also heats, and bakes bread; he also works it into a god, and prostrates himself; makes an idol of it, and falls down before it. The half of it he has burned in the fire: over the half of it he eats flesh, roasts a roast, and is satisfied; he also warms himself, and says, Hurrah, I am getting warm, I feel the heat. And the rest of it he makes into a god, into his idol, and says, Save me, for thou art my god." The subject of the sentence is not the carpenter of the previous verse, but "any one." &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; apparently stands first, as indicating the species; and in the Talmud and Midrash the trees named are really described as &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;. But tirza&#770;h (from ta&#770;raz, to be hard or firm) does not appear to be a coniferous tree; and the connection with 'allo&#772;n, the oak, is favourable to the rendering &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx, A. Th.), ilex (Vulg.). On 'imme&#772;ts, to choose, see <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1503; (with Nun minusculum), plur. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (b. Ros-ha Sana 23a) or &#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (Para iii. 8), is explained by the Talmud as &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, sing. &#1506;&#1512;&#1488;, i.e., according to Aruch and Rashi, laurier, the berries of which are called baies. We have rendered it "fig," according to the lxx and Jerome, since it will not do to follow the seductive guidance of the similarity in sound to ornus (which is hardly equivalent to &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;).<p>(Note: The &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; of Theophrastus is probably quercus ilex, which is still called &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; the laurus nobilis is now called &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#769;, from the branches which serve instead of palm-branches.)<p>The description is genealogical, and therefore moves retrogressively, from the felling to the planting. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a> refers to the felled and planted tree, and primarily to the ash. &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; (of such as these) is neuter, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; at the same time, the prophet had the &#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; (the wood, both as produce and material) in his mind. The repeated &#1488;&#1507; lays emphasis upon the fact, that such different things are done with the very same wood. It is sued for warming, and fore the preparation of food, as well as for making a god. On the verbs of adoration, hishtacha&#774;va&#770;h (root shach, to sink, to settle down) and sa&#770;gad, which is only applied to idolatrous worship, and from which mes'gid, a mosque, is derived, see Holemann's Bibelstudien, i. 3. &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; may no doubt be take as a plural ( equals  &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a>), "such things (taila) does he worship," as Stier supposes; but it is probably pathetic, and equivalent to &#1500;&#1493;, as in <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a> (compare <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>; Ewald, 247, a). According to the double application of the wood mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a>, a distinction is drawn in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-17.htm">Isaiah 44:17</a> between the one half of the wood and the other. The repeated chetsyo&#772; (the half of it) in <a href="/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a> refers to the first half, which furnishes not only fuel for burning, but shavings and coals for roasting and baking as well. And as a fire made for cooking warms quite as much as one made expressly for the purpose, the prophet dwells upon this benefit which the wood of the idol does confer. On the tone upon the last syllable of chammo&#772;th&#305;&#772;, see at <a href="/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>; and on the use of the word &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; as a comprehensive term, embracing every kind of sensation and perception, see my Psychologie, p. 234. Diagoras of Melos, a pupil of Democritus, once threw a wooden standing figure of Hercules into the fire, and said jocularly, "Come now, Hercules, perform thy thirteenth labour, and help me to cook the turnips." </body></html>
