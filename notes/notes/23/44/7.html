The word used here (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498;  &#8219;a&#770;rak) denotes properly "to place in a row; set in order; arrange." It is of the same signification as the Greek &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;  tasso&#772; or &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  tatto&#772;, and is applied to placing the wood upon the altar in a proper manner (<a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>); or to placing the showbread in proper order on the table <a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>; and especially to setting an army in order, or putting it in battle array <a href="/genesis/14-8.htm">Genesis 14:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-20.htm">Judges 20:20</a>, <a href="/judges/20-22.htm">Judges 20:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2</a>.

The verse as translated in A.V. and R.V. reads very awkwardly; it would have to be paraphrased thus: “And which of the other gods shall call etc., as I have done since I appointed the ancient people?’ But the distance of the last clause from the “as I” on which it depends is so great as to make the construction unnatural. It is better, with most commentators, to suppose a parenthesis, and render thus: “And who, as I, proclaims (and let him declare it and set it in order before me) since I founded the people of antiquity?” But a parenthesis is always more or less suspicious in a Hebrew sentence, and this one is doubly so on account of the “and” which introduces it. The LXX. reads, “And who is like me? <span class="ital">Let him stand</span> and proclaim &c.” The additional verb (“stand”) is likely to be original, and the construction of the first part of the clause is faultless. The only difficulty is presented by the temporal clause, “since I appointed” etc., on which see below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">call</span>] means <span class="bld">proclaim</span> or “prophesy,” as in ch. <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm" title="The voice said, Cry.

The accent which connects &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1498;, so as to make &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1498; by itself an attributive clause like &#1489;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, is confirmed by <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a> : Israel as a nation and all the individuals within it are, as the chosen servant of Jehovah (<a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>), the direct formation of Jehovah Himself from the remotest point of their history. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>, Jeshurun is used interchangeably with Jacob. This word occurs in three other passages (viz., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>), and is always written with kibbutz, just as it is here. The rendering &#787;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; in Gr. Ven. is founded upon the supposition that the word is equivalent to &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; - a strange contraction, which is inadmissible, if only on account of the substitution of &#1513;&#1473; for &#1513;&#1474;. The &#1513;&#1473; points back to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight or even; hence A. S. Th. &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c2; (elsewhere &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), Jerome rectissimus (though in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> he renders it, after the lxx, dilectus). It is an offshoot of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (<a href="/psalms/25-21.htm">Psalm 25:21</a>), like &#1494;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; from &#1494;&#1489;&#1500;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1514;; and u&#772;n ( equals  o&#772;n) does not stamp it as a diminutive (for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, which Kamphausen adduces in opposition to Hengstenberg and Volck, does not stand in the same relation to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; as mannikin to man, but rather as the image of a man to a man himself; compare the Arabic insa&#770;n). We must not render it therefore as an affectionate diminutive, as Gesenius does, the more especially as Jehovah, though speaking in loving terms, does not adopt the language of a lover. The relation of Jeshurun to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is rather the same as that of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, so that the real meaning is "gentleman," or one of gentlemanly or honourable mind, though this need not appear in the translation, since the very nature of a proper name would obliterate it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, the blessings to be expected are assigned as the reason for the exhortation to be of good cheer. In <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> water is promised in the midst of drought, and in <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> the Spirit and blessing of God, just as in Joel the promise of rain is first of all placed in contrast with drought; and this is followed by the promise of the far surpassing antitype, namely, the outpouring of the Spirit. There is nothing at variance with this in the fact that we have not the form &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; in the place of &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; fo e (according to the analogy of &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a>). By &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;) we understand the inhabitants of the land who are thirsting for rain, and by yabba&#770;sha&#770;h the parched land itself. Further on, however, an express distinction is made between the abundance of water in the land and the prosperous growth of the nation planted by the side of water-brooks (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). We must not regard <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, therefore, as a figure, and <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> as the explanation, or turn <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> into a simile introduced in the form of a protasis, although unquestionably water and mountain streams are made the symbol, or rather the anagogical type, of spiritual blessings coming down from above in the form of heavenly gifts, by a gradual ascent from &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1504;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;, to trickle downwards, Sol 4:15, <a href="/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a>) to &#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; and &#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;). When these natural and spiritual waters flow down upon the people, once more restored to their home, they spring up among (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; only met with here, lxx and Targum &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;) the grass, like willows by water-brooks. <p>The willows<p>(Note: "The garab," says Wetzstein, "was only met with by me in one locality, or, at any rate, I only noticed it once, namely in the Wady So'b, near to a ford of the river which is called the Hd ford, from the chirbet el-Hd, a miserable ruin not far off. It is half an hour to the west of Nimrin (Nimrim, <a href="/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>), or, speaking more exactly, half an hour above (i.e., to the east of) Zaft Nimriin, an antique road on the northern bank of the river, hewn in a precipitous wall of rock, like the ladder of Tyre. I travelled through the valley in June 1860, and find the following entry in my diary: 'At length the ravine opened up into a broader valley, so that we could get down to the clear, copious, and rapid stream, and were able to cross it. Being exhausted by the heat, we lay down near the ford among the oleanders, which the mass of flowers covered with a rosy glow. The reed grows here to an unusual height, as in the Wady Yarmk, and willows (zafzaf) and garab are mingled together, and form many-branched trees of three or four fathoms in height. The vegetation, which is fresh and luxuriant by the water-side, is scorched up with the heat in the valley within as little as ten paces from the banks of the stream. The farthest off is the 'osar plant, with its thick, juicy, dark green stalks and leaves, and its apple-like fruit, which is of the same colour, and therefore not yet ripe. The garab tree has already done flowering. The leaves of this tree stand quite close around the stem, as in the case of the Sindiana (the Syrian oak), and, like the leaves of the latter, are fringed with little thorns; but, like the willow, it is a water plant, and our companions Abdallah and Nasrallah assured us that it was only met with near flowing water and in hot lowlands. Its bunches of flowers are at the points of the slender branches, and assume an umbelliferous form. This is the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; of the Bible.' Consequently the garab (or (as nom. unitatis) the garaba cannot be regarded as a species of willow; and Winer's assumption (Real-Wrterbuch, s.v. Weiden), that the weeping willow is intended at any rate in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>, is an error. In Arabic the weeping willow is always called shafshaf mustachi (the drooping tree). At the same time, we may render &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; 'willows,' since the garab loves running water as well as the willow, and apparently they seek one another's society; it is quite enough that the difference should be clearly pointed out in the commentary. The reason why the garab did not find its way into my herbarium was the following. On my arrival in Salt, I received the first intelligence of the commencement of the slaughter of the Christians on Antilibanus, and heard the report, which was then commonly believed, that a command had been sent from Constantinople to exterminate Christianity from Syria. This alarming report compelled me to inquire into the actual state of affairs; therefore, leaving my luggage and some of my companions behind, I set off with all speed to Jerusalem, where I hoped to obtain reliable information, accompanied by Herr Drgen, my kavas, and two natives, viz., Abdallah the smith, from Salt, and Nasrallah the smith, from Ain Genna. For a ride like this, which did not form part of the original plan of my journey, everything but weapons, even a herbarium, would have been in the way. Still there are small caravans going every week between Salt and Jerusalem, and they must always cross the Hd ford, so that it would be easy to get a twig of the garab. So far as I remember, the remains of the blossom were of a dirty white colour." (Compare p. 213, where we have taken nachal ha&#770;&#8219;a&#774;ra&#770;bh&#305;&#772;m, according to the meaning of the words, as a synonym of Wady Sufsaf, or, more correctly, Safsf. From the description given above, the garab is a kind of viburnum with indented leaves. This tree, which is of moderate height, is found by the side of streams along with the willow. According to Sprengel (Gesch. der Botanik. i. 25), the safsa&#770;f is the salix subserrata of Wildenow).)<p>are the nation, which has hitherto resembled withered plants in a barren soil, but is now restored to all the bloom of youth through the Spirit and blessing of God. The grass stands for the land, which resembles a green luxuriant plain; and the water-brooks represent the abundant supply of living waters, which promote the prosperity of the land and its inhabitants. </body></html>
