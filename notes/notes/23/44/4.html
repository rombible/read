Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so?

On the meaning of the unusual form of the word &#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;  bebe&#772;yn, in the Hebrew ("in among"), see Vitringa and Rosenmuller. The &#1489;  (b) here is undoubtedly an error of the transcriber for &#1499;  (k) ("as") - an error which, from the similarity of the letters, might be readily made. The Septuagint reads it, &#x3a9;&#788;&#x3c2;  Ho&#772;s - 'As.' The Chaldee reads it, &#1499;  (k) ("as").<p>As willows by the water-courses - Willows are usually planted in such places, and grow rapidly and luxuriantly. It denotes here, abundant increase, vigor and beauty; and means that their posterity would be greatly blessed of God. A similar figure to denote the prosperity and happiness of the righteous occurs in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> :<p>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,<p>That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;<p>His leaf also shall not wither.<p>These two verses teach us:<p>1. That God will pour his blessings on the children of his people - a promise which in all ages, when parents are faithful, is abundantly fulfilled.<p>2. That one of the richest blessings which can be imparted to a people is, that God's Spirit should descend on their children.<p>3. That the Spirit of God alone is the source of true happiness and prosperity to our children. All else - property, learning, accomplishment. beauty, vigor, will be vain. It is by his blessing only - by the influence of piety - that they will spring forth as among the grass, and like willows by the streams of water.<p>4. Parents should pray earnestly for a revival of religion. No better description can be given of a revival than that given here - the Spirit of God descending like streams and floods on the young; and their springing forth in the graces of piety as among the grass, and growing in love to God and love to mankind like willows by the water-courses. Who would not pray for such a work of grace?
