Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul, must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shall it be for a man to burn - It will afford materials for a fire. The design of this verse and the following is, to ridicule the idea of a man's using parts of the same tree to make a fire to cook his victuals, to warm himself, and to shape a god. Nothing could be more stupid than the conduct here referred to, and yet it is common all over the pagan world. It shows the utter debasement of the race, that they thus of the same tree make a fire, cook their food, and construct their gods. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

"The makers of idols, they are all desolation, and their bosom-children worthless; and those who bear witness for them see nothing and know nothing, that they may be put to shame. Who hath formed the god, and cast the idol to no profit? Behold, all its followers will be put to shame; and the workmen are men: let them all assemble together, draw near, be alarmed, be all put to shame together." The cha&#774;mu&#772;d&#305;&#772;m (favourites) of the makers of idols are the false gods, for whose favour they sue with such earnestness. If we retain the word &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, which is pointed as critically suspicious, and therefore is not accentuated, the explanation might possibly be, "Their witnesses (i.e., witnesses against themselves) are they (the idols): they see not, and are without consciousness, that they (those who trust in them) may be put to shame." In any case, the subject to ye&#772;bho&#772;shu&#772; (shall be put to shame) is the worshippers of idols. If we erase &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; will be those who come forward as witnesses for the idols. This makes the words easier and less ambiguous. At the same time, the Septuagint retains the word (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;). As "not seeing" here signifies to be blind, so "not knowing" is also to be understood as a self-contained expression, meaning to be irrational, just as in <a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a> (in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, on the other hand, we have taken it in a different sense). &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; implies that the will of the sinner in his sin has also destruction for its object; and this is not something added to the sin, but growing out of it. The question in <a href="/isaiah/44-10.htm">Isaiah 44:10</a> summons the maker of idols for the purpose of announcing his fate, and in &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (to no profit) this announcement is already contained. <a href="/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a> is simply a development of this expression, "to no profit." &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, like &#1504;&#1496;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>, is contrary to the rhythmical law milra which prevails elsewhere. &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (its followers) are not the fellow-workmen of the maker of idols (inasmuch as in that case the maker himself would be left without any share in the threat), but the associates (i.e., followers) of the idols (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>). It is a pernicious work that they have thus had done for them. And what of the makers themselves? They are numbered among the men. So that they who ought to know that they are made by God, become makers of gods themselves. What an absurdity! Let them crowd together, the whole guild of god-makers, and draw near to speak to the works they have made. All their eyes will soon be opened with amazement and alarm. </body></html>
