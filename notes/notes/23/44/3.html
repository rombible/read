Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes.

That it here refers to the Holy Spirit and his influences, is proved by the parallel expressions in the subsequent part of the verse.<p>Upon him that is thirsty - Or rather, 'on the thirsty land.' The word &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;  tsa&#770;me&#772;' refers here rather to land, and the figure is taken from a burning sandy desert, where waters would be made to burst out in copious streams (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a>). The sense is, that God would bestow blessings upon them as signal and marvelous, as if floods of waters were made to descend on the dry, parched, and desolated earth.<p>And floods - The word &#1504;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  no&#770;zel&#305;&#770;ym, from &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;  na&#770;zal, "to flow," to run as liquids, means properly flowings, and is used for streams and rivers <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18</a> It means here that the spiritual influences which would descend on the afflicted, desolate, comfortless, and exiled people, would be like torrents of rain poured on the thirsty earth.

Or rather upon the thirsty land, as the Targum; and so the Syriac version, "in a thirsty place"; as a dry land is a thirsty land; it thirsts for water, gapes and opens for it: see <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a> "and floods upon the dry ground"; large quantities of rain to moisten it, and make it fruitful; these figurative expressions are explained in the next clauses: <p>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring; by which "seed" and "offspring" are meant the spiritual seed of this remnant or little church of Christ among the Jews, in the first times of the Gospel: such as should be regenerated and converted in it, and who are signified by the "dry" and "thirsty" ground; for being made sensible of their desolate condition, their barrenness and unfruitfulness, they hungered and thirsted after righteousness; were desirous of Christ and his grace, and more knowledge of him, and eagerly sought after them; and to these are promised the Spirit, and his gifts and graces, compared to water, for its purifying, softening, fructifying, and refreshing nature, and for extinguishing thirst, and giving a real pleasure and delight; see <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a> and the abundance thereof is signified by "floods" of water; for in first conversion especially, there is an abounding, yea a superabounding of the grace of God; it is a well of living water; yea, out of the believer flow rivers of living water, <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a> and this grace of the Spirit is always a blessing: and indeed all the blessings of grace go along with it, as to the manifestation and application of them as justification, pardon of sin, adoption, &amp;c.; here perhaps a more special regard is had to the extraordinary effusion of the Spirit, on the day of Pentecost, when the apostles of Christ being furnished with his gifts and graces, were fitted to go forth with the "fullness of the blessing" of the Gospel of Christ. The Targum of the whole is, <p>"for as waters are given upon the thirsty land, and they flow upon the dry land, so will I give my Holy Spirit on thy children, and my blessing upon thy children's children;'' <p>a succession of converts in the Christian church. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I will pour water upon him that is <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring:</span><p>(c) Because man of himself is as the dry and barren land, he promises to moisten him with the waters of his Holy Spirit, Joel 2:28, Joh 7:38, Ac 2:17.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

Here, however, a figurative sense predominates, as is shewn by what follows. The “spirit” is the agent both of physical and moral regeneration, as in ch. <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.">Isaiah 32:15</a> (cf. <a href="/context/ezekiel/37-11.htm" title="Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts....">Ezekiel 37:11-14</a>); the former idea being prominent; hence the parallelism “spirit”—“blessing,” the former being the cause, the latter the effect. On the figure of water for the spirit, cf. <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a> etc. <span class="ital">seed</span> and <span class="ital">offspring</span> are individual Israelites.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pour water upon him that is thirsty</span>. "Water" is, in Isaiah, the common metaphor for Divine grace. Sometimes, as in this place (and <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), the simple <span class="accented">maim</span>, "water" or "waters," is the word used. At other times we have instead, or in addition, "rain" (<a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>), or "dew" (<a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>), or "rivers" (<a href="/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, etc.), or "streams" (<a href="/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), or "floods" (as in this place). At his coming on earth, our blessed Lord took up the comparison, and has made it familiar to all men throughout the whole Christian world (see <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 11, 13-15</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>). We may note here that the "water" is only poured on him who is athirst for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed...  thine offspring</span>. Not "Israel after the flesh" only, but also Israel after the Spirit - the true "Israel of God" (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nevertheless, the sustaining power of divine love is greater than the gravitating force of divine wrath. "I, I alone, blot out thy transgressions for my own sake, and do not remember thy sins." Jehovah Himself here announces the sola gratia and sola fides. We have adopted the rendering "I alone," because the threefold repetition of the subject, "I, I, He is blotting out thy transgressions," is intended to affirm that this blotting out of sin is so far from being in any way merited by Israel, that it is a sovereign act of His absolute freedom; and the expression "for my own sake," that it has its foundation only in God, namely, in His absolute free grace, that movement of His love by which wrath is subdued. For the debt stands written in God's own book. Justice has entered it, and love alone blots it out (ma&#770;cha&#770;h, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, as in <a href="/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-14.htm">Psalm 109:14</a>); but, as we know from the actual fulfilment, not without paying with blood, and giving the quittance with blood. </body></html>
