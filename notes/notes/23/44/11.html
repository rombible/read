Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance.

"One will say, I belong to Jehovah; and a second will solemnly name the name of Jacob; and a third will inscribe himself to Jehovah, and name the name of Israel with honour." The threefold zeh refers to the heathen, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4-5</a>. One will declare himself to belong to Jehovah; another will call with the name of Jacob, i.e., (according to the analogy of the phrase &#1492; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;) make it the medium and object of solemn exclamation; a third will write with his hand (&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, an acc. of more precise definition, like &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, and &#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; in <a href="/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>), "To Jehovah," thereby attesting that he desires to belong to Jehovah, and Jehovah alone. This is the explanation given by Gesenius, Hahn, and others; whereas Hitzig and Knobel follow the lxx in the rendering, "he will write upon his hand '&#8219;layeho&#772;va&#770;h,' i.e., mark the name of Jehovah upon it." But apart from the fact that ka&#770;thabh, with an accusative of the writing materials, would be unprecedented (the construction required would be &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;), this view is overthrown by the fact that tatooing was prohibited by the Israelitish law (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; compare the mark of the beast in <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>). &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is interchanged with &#1489;&#1505;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, to surname, or entitle (the Syriac and Arabic are the same; compare the Arabic kunye, the name given to a man as the father of such and such a person, e.g., Abu-Muhammed, rhetorically called metonymy). The name Israel becomes a name or title of honour among the heathen. This concludes the fourth prophecy, which opens out into three distinct fields. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a> it began to approach the close, just as the third did in <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> -a well-rounded whole, which leaves nothing wanting. </body></html>
