No doubt the immediate application of this chapter is to the exiled nation, who in it are summoned from their vain attempts to find satisfaction in the material prosperity realised in exile, and to make the only true blessedness their own by obedience to God’s voice. But if ever the prophet spoke to the world he does so here. It is no unwarranted spiritualising of his invitation which hears in it the voice which invites all mankind to share the blessings of the gospel feast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The glorious words need little exposition. What we have to do is to see that they do not fall on our ears in vain. They may be roughly divided into two sections-the invitation to the feast, with the promises to the obedient Israel {<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a>}, and the summons to the necessary preparation for the feast, namely, repentance, with the reason for its necessity, and the encouragements to it in the might of God’s faithful promises {<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm" title="Seek you the LORD while he may be found, call you on him while he is near:">Isaiah 55:6</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-13.htm" title="Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.">Isaiah 55:13</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Whose voice sounds so beseechingly and welcoming in this great call, which rings out to all thirsty souls?</span> If we note the ‘Me’ and ‘I’ which follow, we shall hear God Himself thus taking the office of summoner to His own feast. By whatever media the gospel call reaches us, it is in reality God’s own voice to our hearts, and that makes the responsibility of hearing more tremendous, and the folly of refusing more inexcusable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Who are invited? There are but two conditions expressed in <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>, and these are fulfilled in every soul. All are summoned who are thirsty and penniless. If we have in our souls desires that all the broken cisterns of earth can never slake-and we all have these-and if we have nothing by which we can procure what will still the gnawing hunger and burning thirst of our souls-and none of us has-then we are included in the call. Universal as are the craving for blessedness and the powerlessness to satisfy it, are the adaptation and destination of the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What is offered? Water, wine, milk-all the beverages of a simple civilisation, differing in their operation, but all precious to a thirsty palate. Water revives, wine gladdens and inspirits, milk nourishes. All that any man needs or desires is to be found in Christ. We shall not understand the nature of the feast unless we remember that He Himself is the ‘gift of God.’ What these three draughts mean is best perceived when we listen to Him saying, in a plain quotation of this call, ‘If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.’ Nothing short of Himself can satisfy the thirst of one soul, much less of all the thirsty. Like the flow from the magic fountain of the legend, Jesus becomes to each what each most desires.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How does He become ours? The paradox of buying with what is not money is meant, by its very appearance of contradiction, to put in strongest fashion that the possession of Him depends on nothing in us but the sense of need and the willingness to accept. We buy Christ when we part with self, which is all that we have, in order to win Him. We must be full of conscious emptiness and desire, if we are to be filled with His fulness. Jesus interpreted the meaning of ‘come to the waters’ when He said, ‘He that cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.’ Faith is coming, faith is drinking, faith is buying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The universal call, with is clear setting forth of blessing and conditions of possessing, is followed by a pleading remonstrance as to the folly of lavishing effort and money on what is not bread. It is strange that men will cheerfully take more pains to continue thirsty than to accept the satisfaction which God provides. They toil and continue unsatisfied. Experience does not teach them, and all the while the one real good is waiting to be theirs for nothing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘‘Tis heaven alone that is given away;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Tis only God may be had for the asking.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Christ goes a-begging, and we spend our strength in vain toil to acquire what we turn away from when it is offered us in Him. When the great Father offers bread for nothing, we will not have it, but we are ready to give any price for a stone. It is not the wickedness, but the folly, of unbelief, which is the marvel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The contrast between the heavy price at which men buy hunger, and the easy rate at which they may have full satisfaction, is further set forth by the call to ‘incline the ear,’ which is all that is needed in order that life and nourishment which delights the soul may be ours. ‘Hearken, and eat’ is equivalent to ‘Hearken, and ye shall eat.’ The real ‘good’ for man is only to be found in listening to and obeying the divine voice, whether it sound in invitation, promise, or command. The true life of the soul lies in that listening receptiveness which takes for one’s own God’s great gift of Christ, and yields glad obedience to His every word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The exiled Israel was promised an ‘everlasting covenant’ as the result of their acceptance of the invitation; and we know whose blood it is that has sealed the new covenant, which abides as long as Christ’s fulness and men’s need shall last. That covenant, of which we seldom hear in Isaiah, but which fills a prominent place in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, is further explained as being ‘the sure mercies of David.’ This phrase and its context are difficult, but the general meaning is clear. The great promises of God’s unfailing mercy, made to the historical founder of the royal house, shall be transferred and continued, with inviolable faithfulness, to those who drink of the gift of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This parallel between the great King and the whole mass of the true Israel is further set forth in <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a>. Each begins with ‘Behold,’ and the similar form indicates similarity in contents. The son of Jesse was in some degree God’s witness to the heathen nations, as is expressed in several psalms; and, what he was imperfectly, the ransomed Israel would be to the world. The office of the Christian Church is to draw nations that it knew not, to follow in the blessed path, in which it has found satisfaction and the dawnings of a more than natural glory transfiguring it. They who have themselves drunk of the unfailing fountain in Christ are thereby fitted and called to cry to others, ‘Come ye to the waters.’ Experience of Christ’s preciousness, and of the rest of soul which comes from partaking of His salvation, impels and obliges to call others to share the bliss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">II. The second part of the chapter begins with an urgent call to repentance</span>, based upon the difference between God’s ways and man’s, and on the certainty that the divine promises will be fulfilled. The summons in <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm" title="Seek you the LORD while he may be found, call you on him while he is near:">Isaiah 55:6</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm" title="Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.">Isaiah 55:7</a> is first couched in most general terms, which are then more closely defined. To ‘seek the Lord’ is to direct conduct and heart to obtain possession of God as one’s own. Of that seeking, the chief element is calling upon Him; since such is His desire to be found of us that it only needs our asking in order to receive. As surely as the mother hears her child’s cry, so surely does He catch the faintest voice addressed to Him. But, men being what they are, a change of ways and of their root in thoughts is indispensable. Seeking which is not accompanied by forsaking self and an evil past is no genuine seeking, and will end in no finding. But this forsaking is only one side of true repentance; the other is return to God, as is expressed in the New Testament word for it, which implies a change of mind, purpose, and conduct. The faces which were turned earthward and averted from God are to be turned God-ward and diverted from earth. Whosoever thus seeks may be confident of finding and of abundant pardon. The belief in God’s loving forgivingness is the strongest motive to repentance, and the most melting argument to listen to the call to seek Him. But there is another motive of a more awful kind; namely, the consideration that the period of mercy is limited, and that a time may come, and that soon, when God no longer ‘may be found’ nor ‘is near.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The need for such a radical change in conduct and mind is further enforced, in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm" title="For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.">Isaiah 55:8</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm" title="For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.">Isaiah 55:9</a>, by the emphatic statement of present discord between the exiled Israel and God. Mark that the deepest seat of the discord is first dealt with, and then the manifestation of it in active life. Mark also that the order of comparison is inverted in the two successive clauses in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm" title="For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.">Isaiah 55:8</a>. God’s thoughts have not entered into Israel’s mind and become theirs. The ‘thinkings’ not being regulated according to God’s truth, nor the desires and sentiments brought into accord with His will and mind, a contrariety of ‘ways’ must follow, and the paths which men choose for themselves cannot run parallel with God’s, nor be pleasing to Him. Therefore the stringent urgency of the call to forsake ‘the crooked, wandering ways in which we live,’ and to come back to the path of righteousness which is traced by God for our feet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But divergence which necessitates repentance is not the only relation between our ways and God’s. There is elevation, transcendency, like that of the eternal heavens, high, boundless, the home of light, the storehouse of beneficent influences which fertilise. If we think of the dreary, flat plains where the exiles were, and the magnificent sweep of the sky over them, we shall feel the beauty of the figure. If ‘My thoughts are not your thoughts’ was all that was to be said, repentance would be of little use, and there would be little to encourage to it; but if God’s thoughts of love and ways of blessing arch themselves above our low lives as the sky bends, pitying and bestowing, above squalor, barrenness, and darkness, then penitence is not in vain, and the low earth may be visited with gifts from the highest heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The certainty that such gifts will be bestowed is the last thought of this magnificent summons. The prophet dilates on that assurance to the end of the chapter. He seems to catch fire, as it were, from the introduction of that grand figure of the lofty heavens domed above the flat earth. In effect, what he says is: They are high and inaccessible, but think what pours down from them, and how all fertility depends on their gifts of rain and snow, and how the moisture which they drop is turned into ‘seed to the sower, and bread to the eater.’ Thinking of that continuous benefaction and miracle, we should see in it a symbol of the better gifts from the higher heavens. So does God’s word come down from His throne. So does it turn barrenness into nodding harvest. So does it quicken undreamed of powers of fruitfulness in human nature and among the forces of the world. So does it supply nourishment for hungry souls, and germs which shall bear fruit in coming years. No complicated machinery nor the most careful culture can work what the gentle dropping rain effects. There is mightier force in it than in many thunder-clouds. The gospel does with ease and in silence what nothing else can do. It makes barren souls fruitful in all good works, and in all happiness worthy of men. Therefore the summons to drink of the springing fountain and to turn from evil ways and thoughts is recommended by the assurance that God’s word is faithful, and all His promises firm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The final verses {<a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm" title="For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.">Isaiah 55:12</a> - <a href="/isaiah/55-13.htm" title="Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.">Isaiah 55:13</a>} give the glowing picture of the return from exile amid the jubilation of a transformed world, as the strongest motive to the obedient hearkening to God’s voice, to which the chapter has summoned, and as the great instance of God’s keeping His word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The flight from Egypt was ‘in haste’ {<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm" title="You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>}; but this shall be a triumphal exodus, without conflict or alarms. All nature shall participate in the joy. Mountains and hills shall raise the shrill note of rejoicing, and the trees wave their branches, as if clapping hands in delight. This is more than mere poetic rhetoric. A redeemed humanity implies a glorified world. Nature has been involved in the consequences of sin, and will share in the results of redemption, and have some humble reflected light from ‘the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fulfilment of this final promise is not yet. All earlier returns of the exiled Israel from the Babylon of their bondage to God and the city of God, such as the historical one which the prophet foretold, and the spiritual one which is repeated age by age in the history of the Christian Church and of single penitent souls, point on to that last triumphant day when ‘the ransomed of the Lord shall return,’ and the world be transfigured to match the glory that they inherit. That fair world without poison or offence, and the nations of the saved who inhabit its peaceful spaces, shall be, in the fullest stretch of the words, ‘to the Lord for a name, and for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.’ The redemption of man and his establishing amid the felicities of a state correspondent to His God-given glory shall be to all eternity and to all possible creations the highest evidence of what God is, and His token to all beings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/55.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/55-10.htm" title="For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:...">Isaiah 55:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">For as the rain cometh down — </span>To water and refresh the earth, and render it fruitful; <span class="ital">and the snow from heaven </span>— Which, in its season, contributes to the fertility of the earth, as well as the rain; <span class="ital">and returneth not thither </span>— Namely, without effect, or immediately: it is not drawn up again as soon as it comes down, but abides for a convenient time upon the earth, until it do that work for which it is sent. <span class="ital">That it may give seed and bread, </span>&c. — That it may bring forth store of bread-corn, both for men’s present supplies, and for seed for the next year. <span class="ital">So shall my word be </span>— My promises concerning the pardon of the greatest sinners, and the redemption and salvation of mankind. <span class="ital">It shall not return unto me void </span>— Without success.

It shall not be in vain to seek God, now his word is calling to us, and his Spirit is striving with us. But there is a day coming when he will not be found. There may come such a time in this life; it is certain that at death and judgment the door will be shut. There must be not only a change of the way, but a change of the mind. We must alter our judgments about persons and things. It is not enough to break off from evil practices, we must strive against evil thoughts. To repent is to return to our Lord, against whom we have rebelled. If we do so, God will multiply to pardon, as we have multiplied to offend. But let none trifle with this plenteous mercy, or use it as an occasion to sin. Men's thoughts concerning sin, Christ, and holiness, concerning this world and the other, vastly differ from God's; but in nothing more than in the matter of pardon. We forgive, and cannot forget; but when God forgives sin, he remembers it no more. The power of his word in the kingdoms of providence and grace, is as certain as in that of nature. Sacred truth produces a spiritual change in the mind of men, which neither rain nor snow can make on the earth. It shall not return to the Lord without producing important effects. If we take a special view of the church, we shall find what great things God has done, and will do for it. The Jews shall come to their own land; this shall represent the blessings promised. Gospel grace will make a great change in men. Delivered from the wrath to come, the converted sinner finds peace in his conscience; and love constrains him to devote himself to the service of his Redeemer. Instead of being profane, contentious, selfish, or sensual, behold him patient, humble, kind, and peaceable. The hope of helping in such a work should urge us to spread the gospel of salvation. And do thou help us, O Spirit of all truth, to have such views of the fulness, freeness, and greatness of the rich mercy in Christ, as may remove from us all narrow views of sovereign grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For as the rain cometh down - The meaning of this verse and the following is plain. This refers evidently, as the whole passage does, to the times which should succeed the coming of the Messiah. The hearts of people by nature are what the earth would be without the rains of heaven - barren and sterile. But God says that his truth shall certainly accomplish an effect similar to that produced by descending showers. The rain never descends in vain. It makes the earth fertile, beautiful, and lovely. So would it be with his truth in the moral world. The comparison of truth with descending rain or dews is exceedingly beautiful, and occurs not unfrequently in the Bible. See <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a> - <p>My doctrine shall drop as the rain,<p>My speech shall distil as the dew,<p>As the small rain upon the tender herb,<p>And as the showers upon the grass.<p>Compare <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; the note at <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>.<p>And the snow - This is a part of the emblem or symbol designed to denote the fertilizing effect of the truth of God. The snow, as well as the rain, accomplishes important purposes in rendering the earth fertile. It constitutes a covering that contributes to the warmth and preservation of plants and vegetation in the colder latitudes, and on the hills and mountains is accumulated in the winter months to fill the streams, or produce the overflowing of the rivers in the spring and the summer. This expression should not, however, be pressed ad unguem in the interpretation, as if it contained any special spiritual signification. It is a part of the general description of that which descends from heaven to render the earth fertile.<p>From heaven - From the clouds.<p>And returneth not thither - That is, not in the form in which they descend on the earth. They return not there as rain and snow. The main idea is, they do not return without accomplishing the effect which God intends.<p>And bud - Put forth its increase; causes it to sprout up, or germinate.

This word &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsa&#770;mach means rather "to germinate," or to cause to vegetate in general.

This purpose of salvation is embodied in the word which goes forth from Jehovah’s mouth. The “word” is conceived as endowed with a self-fulfilling energy (see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm" title="The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel.">Isaiah 9:8</a>); and its silent but irresistible efficacy is set forth by a beautiful comparison from nature.

The rain and the snow are God's ministers (<a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>), and go forth from him, just as his word does. They have an appointed work to do, and do not return to him, whose ministers they are, until they have done it. It is best to translate, with Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne, "As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, except it hath watered the earth," etc. The writer is, apparently, aware, as the writer of Ecclesiastes is, that the water which falls from heaven in the shape of rain does return thither again in the shape of vapour (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/55.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And in this way it is possible to obtain not only the satisfaction of absolute need, but a superabundant enjoyment, and an overflowing fulfilment of the promise. "Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and let your soul revive; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the true mercies of David. Behold, I have set him as a witness for nations, a prince and commander of nations. Behold, thou wilt call a mass of people that thou knowest not; and a mass of people that knoweth thee not will hasten to thee, for the sake of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, that He hath made thee glorious." The expression "make a covenant" (ka&#770;rath ber&#305;&#772;th) is not always applied to a superior in relation to an inferior (compare, on the contrary, <a href="/ezra/10-3.htm">Ezra 10:3</a>); but here the double-sided idea implied in pactio is confined to one side alone, in the sense of a spontaneous sponsio having all the force of a covenant (<a href="/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>, where ka&#770;rath by itself signifies "to promise with the force of a covenant"), and also of the offer of a covenant or anticipated conclusion of a covenant, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>, and in the case before us, where "the true mercies of David" are attached to the idea of offering or granting involved in the expression, "I will make an everlasting covenant with you," as a more precise definition of the object. All that is required on the part of Israel is hearing, and coming, and taking: let it do this, and it will be pervaded by new life; and Jehovah will meet with with an everlasting covenant, viz., the unchangeable mercies of David. Our interpretation of this must be dependent chiefly upon whether <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> is regarded as looking back to the history of David, or looking forward to something future. In the latter case we are either to understand by "David" the second David (according to <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>), so that the allusion is to the mercies granted in the Messiah, and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, enduring "from henceforth even for ever;" or else David is the son of Jesse, and "the mercies of David" are the mercies bestowed upon him, which are called "the true mercies" as mercies promised and running into the future (<a href="/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>), in which case <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> explains what David will become in the person of his antitype the second David. The directly Messianic application of the name "David" is to be objected to, on the ground that the Messiah is never so called without further remark; whilst the following objections may be adduced to the indirectly Messianic interpretation of <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> (David in the Messiah). (1.) The change of the tense in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>, which requires that we should assume that <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> points backwards into the past, and <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> forwards into the future.<p>(Note: F. Philippi observes that &#1492;&#1503;, which refers to the future in <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> at any rate, must be taken as referring to the same sphere of time as that which immediately precedes. But he&#772;n in Isaiah points sometimes backwards (<a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>), sometimes forwards; and where two follow one another, of which the one points backwards and the other forwards, the former is followed by the perfect, the latter by the future (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1-2</a>). But if they both point to the future, the future tense is used in both instances (<a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>). A better argument in favour of the prophetic interpretation of <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> might be drawn from the fact that &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1503; may mean "I give (set, lay, or make) even now" (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). But what we have said above is sufficient proof that this is not the meaning here (if this were the meaning, we should rather expect &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1503;).)<p>(2.) That the choice of the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> is designed to represent what Israel has to look for in the future as going beyond what was historically realized in David; for in <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> the mass of the heathen world, which has hitherto stood out of all relation to Israel, answers to the &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;.   (3.) That the juxtaposition of the Messiah and Israel would be altogether without parallel in these prophecies (chapters 40-66), and contrary to their peculiar character; for the earlier stereotype idea of the Messiah is here resolved into the idea of the "servant of Jehovah," from which it returns again to its primary use, i.e., from the national basis to the individual, by means of the ascending variations through which this expression passes, and thus reaches a more comprehensive, spiritual, and glorified form. The personal "servant of Jehovah" is undoubtedly no other than the "Son of David" of the earlier prophecy; but the premises, from which we arrive at this conclusion in connection with our prophet, are not that the "servant of Jehovah" is of the seed of David and the final personal realization of the promise of a future king, but that he is of the nation of Israel, and the final personal realization of the idea of Israel, both in its inward nature, and in its calling in relation to the whole world of nations.<p>Consequently <a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> stand to one another in the relation of type and antitype, and the "mercies of David" are called "the true mercies" (Probably with an allusion to <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-30</a>), as being inviolable-mercies which had both been realized in the case of David himself, and would be realized still further, inasmuch as they must endure for an everlasting future, and therefore be further and further fulfilled, until they have reached that lofty height, on the summit of which they will remain unchangeable for ever. It is of David the son of Jesse that Jehovah says in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>, "I have given him for a witness to peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples." So far as the sense is concerned, &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; is as much a construct as &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;. In the application to David of the term &#1506;&#1491;, which never means anything but testis, witness, in these prophecies, we may clearly see the bent of the prophet's mind towards what is spiritual. David had subdued nations by the force of arms, but his true and loftiest greatness consisted in the fact that he was a witness of the nations - a witness by the victorious power of his word, the conquering might of his Psalms, the attractive force of his typical life. What he expresses so frequently in the Psalms as a resolution and a vow, viz., that he will proclaim the name of Jehovah among the nations (<a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-10.htm">Psalm 57:10</a>), he has really fulfilled: he has not only overcome them by bloody warfare, but by the might of his testimony, more especially as "the sweet psalmist of Israel" (<a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>). What David himself was able to say in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>, "People that I did not know served me," will be fulfilled to a still wider extent in the experience of Israel. Having been presented with the promised "inviolable mercies of David," it will effect a spiritual conquest over the heathen world, even over that portion which has hitherto stood in no reciprocal relation to it, and gain possession of it for itself for the sake of Jehovah, whom it has for its God, and to the Holy One of Israel (&#1500; of the object, in relation to which, or at the instigation of which, anything is done), because He hath glorified it (His people: &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; is not a pausal form for &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, but for &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, hence  equals  &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, cf., &#1506;&#1504;&#1498;, <a href="/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>); so that joining themselves to Israel is the same as joining themselves to God and to the church of the God of revelation (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>, where <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> is repeated almost word for word). </body></html>
