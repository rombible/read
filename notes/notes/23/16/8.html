With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him.

The 'fields' here evidently mean "vineyards," for so the parallelism demands. So in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a> :<p>Their vine is of the vine of Sodom,<p>And of the fields of Gomorrah.<p>And the vine of Sibmah - Sibmah, or Shibmah, was a city of Reuben <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>. Jeremiah, in the parallel place <a href="/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a> speaks of the vine of Sibmah also. He also says that the enemies of Moab had taken Sibmah, and that the vine and wine had been destroyed <a href="/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>. There was no more certain mode of producing desolation in a land where grapes were extensively cultivated than to cut down the vines. The Turks constantly practice that in regard to their enemies, and the result is, that wide desolation comes upon the countries which they invade. At this time it is probable that Sibmah belonged to the Moabites. It is mentioned here as being distinguished for the luxuriant production of the grape. Seetzen still found the vine cultivated in that region. Jerome says, that between Sibmah and Heshbon there was scarcely a distance of five hundred paces, half a Roman mile.<p>The lords of the heathen - The princes of the pagan nations that had come to invade Moab. The words 'have broken down' (&#1492;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;  ha&#770;lemu&#770;) may be taken in either of two senses, either to beat, strike, or break down, as in our version; or "to be" beaten, or smitten with wine - that is, to become intoxicated - like the Greek &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3be;  oinople&#772;x - "smitten with wine." The former is doubtless the sense here.<p>The principal plants thereof - The chose vines of it - "her sorek" (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;  s'eru&#770;qeha&#772;). (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>.)<p>They are come - That is, the vines of Sibmah had spread or extended themselves even to Jazer, indicating their great luxuriance and fertility." Jazer was a city at the foot of the mountains of Gilead which was given to Gad, and afterward to the Levites <a href="/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a>. Jerome says it was about fifteen miles from Heshbon. Seetzen found the ruins of a city called Szar, and another place called Szir, from which a small stream (Nahar Szir) flows into the Jordan (Gesenius). That the shoots of the vine of Sibmah reached unto Jazer and the desert, is a beautiful poetic expression for the extensive spread and luxuriance of the vine in that region.<p>They wandered - The vines "wandered" in the desert. They found no twig or tree to which they could attach themselves, and they spread around in wild luxuriancy.<p>Through the wilderness - The wilderness or desert of Arabia, which encompassed Moab.<p>Her branches are stretched out - Are extended far, or are very luxuriant.<p>They are gone over the sea - Called in the parallel place in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>, 'the Sea of Jazer;' probably some lake that had that name near the city of Jazer. It may "possibly" mean the Dead Sea, but that name is not elsewhere given to the Dead Sea in the Scriptures. It has been objected by some to this statement that modern travelers have not found any such place as the 'Sea of Jazer;' or any lake in the vicinity of Jazer. But we may observe - <p>(1) that Seetzen found a stream flowing into the Jordan near Jazer; and<p>(2) that it is possible that a pond or lake may have once there existed which may have been since, in the course of ages, filled with sand.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. fields&#8212;vine-fields (De 32:32).<p>vine of Sibmah&#8212;near Heshbon: namely, languishes.<p>lords of &#8230; heathen&#8212;The heathen princes, the Assyrians, &c., who invaded Moab, destroyed his vines.

The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by Gesenius, Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Meier, and Dr. Kay. <span class="cmt_word">They are come even unto Jazer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">the vines</span>)<span class="accented">reached to Jazer</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vine of Sibmah was cultivated as far as Jazer. Jazer lay about twelve miles north of Heshben, in the territory of Gad (<a href="/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). It is probably identified with <span class="accented">Es Szir</span>, which is in the required position, and retains a trace of the name (Seetzen,' Reisen,' vol. 1. pp. 397, 398). <span class="cmt_word">They wandered through the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they strayed into the wilderness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cultivation was pushed eastward into the actual <span class="accented">midbar</span>, or desert. <span class="cmt_word">Her branches are stretched out</span>; or, <span class="accented">her offshoots are spread abroad</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the young shoots or slips are taken by the cultivators and spread further and further. They are even carried across the Dead Sea, and planted on its western shore. Mr. Cheyne supposes the prophet to refer to the "vineyards of En-gedi" (<a href="/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The advice does not remain without effect, but they embrace it eagerly."And the daughters of Moab will be like birds fluttering about, a scared nest, at the fords of the Arnon." "The daughters of Moab," like "the daughters of Judah," for example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12</a>, are the inhabitants of the cities and villages of the land of Moab. They were already like birds soaring about (<a href="/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8</a>), because of their flight from their own land; but here, as we may see from the expression &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; ... &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the simile is intended to depict the condition into which they would be thrown by the prophet's advice. The figure (cf., <a href="/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a>) as well as the expression (cf., <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>) is thoroughly Isaiah's. It is a state of anxious and timid indecision, resembling the fluttering to and fro of birds, that have been driven away from their nest, and wheel anxiously round and round, without daring to return to their old home. In this way the daughters of Moab, coming out of their hiding-places, whether nearer or more remote, show themselves at the fords of the Arnon, that is to say, on the very soil of their old home, which was situated between the Arnon and Wady el-Ahsa, and which was now devastated by the hand of a foe. &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; we should regard as in apposition to benoth Moab (the daughters of Moab), if ma&#8219;ba&#770;roth signifies the coast-lands (like &#8219;ebre&#772; in <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>), and not, as it invariably does, the fords. It is locative in its meaning, and is so accentuated. </body></html>
