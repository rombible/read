This judgment, says the prophet, was denounced against Moab in former times, particularly by Amos, (<a href="/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a>,) and is now confirmed, and the particular time specified when it shall be accomplished.

Vitringa is of opinion, that this prophecy was delivered at the same time with that preceding, that is, in the year when Ahaz died, at which time the Israelites, as well as the Jews, stood much in need of the kindness of the Moabites; so that it had its completion in the third year of King Hezekiah, namely, from the death of his father, which was really the fourth year of his reign, when Shalmaneser, coming against the Ephraimites, on a sudden attacked the Moabites, and plundered and destroyed their cities: see <a href="/2_kings/18-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.">2 Kings 18:9</a>. This is also Bishop Lowth’s opinion, as has been stated in the note on <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;">Isaiah 15:1</a>. It may, however, be understood of some other great blow given to the Moabites; perhaps by Sennacherib, or by his son Esar-haddon; (in which case Isaiah must have delivered this prophecy some years later;) from which blow, notwithstanding, they in a little time recovered themselves, and flourished again, and continued so to do, till Nebuchadnezzar completed their destruction according to the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm" title="Against Moab thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, &c. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:6-14 Those who will not be counselled, cannot be helped. More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the word - This is the substance of the "former" predictions respecting Moab. This has been the "general course" or sense of the prophecies respecting Moab, during all its history.<p>Since that time - Formerly; from former times. There had been a course of predictions declaring in general that Moab should be destroyed, and the prophet says here that he had expressed their general sense; or that "his" predictions accorded with them all - for they all predicted the complete overthrow of Moab. He now says <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a> that these general prophecies respecting Moab which had been of so long standing were now to be speedily accomplished. The prophecies respecting Moab, foretelling its future ruin, may be seen in <a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>; <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>. It "may," however, be intended here that the former portion of this prophecy had been uttered by Isaiah himself during the early part of his prophetic life. He is supposed to have prophesied some sixty or more years ("see" Introduction, Section 3); and it may be that the prophecy in the fifteenth and the previous part of the sixteenth chapter had been uttered during the early part of his life without specifying the time when it would be fulfilled; but now he says, that it would be accomplished in three years. Or it may be that some other prophet had uttered the prediction which he now repeats with additions at the close. The fact that Isaiah had done this on some occasions seems probable from the beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2</a>, which appears to be a quotation from <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-3</a> (see the Analysis to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>, and the notes at <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. since that time&#8212;rather, "respecting that time" [Horsley].

"Therefore will Moab wail for Moab, everything will wail: for the grape-cakes of Kir-hareseth will ye whine, utterly crushed. For the fruit-fields of Heshbon have faded away: the vine of Sibmah, lords of the nations its branches smote down; they reached to Ja'zer, trailed through the desert: its branches spread themselves out wide, crossed over the sea." The Lamed in l'Moab is the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, and in la'ashishe&#772;, which follows here. Kir-hareseth (written Kir-heres in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>, and by Jeremiah; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>, where the vowel-pointing is apparently false): Heres or Hareseth may possibly refer to the glazed tiles or grooved stones. As this was the principal fortress of Moab, and according to <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a> it had already been destroyed, &#8219;ashishe&#772; appears to mean the "strong foundations," - namely, as laid bare; in other words, the "ruins" (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>, and mo&#772;sede&#772; in <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). But in every other passage in which the word occurs it signifies a kind of cake; and as the devastation of the vines of Moab is made the subject of mourning afterwards, it has the same meaning here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, namely raisin-cakes, or raisins pressed into the form of cakes. Such cakes as these may have been a special article of the export trade of Kir. Jeremiah has altered 'ashishe&#772; into 'anshe&#772; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>), and thus made men out of the grapes. Ha&#770;ga&#770;h is to be understood in accordance with <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a> (viz., of the cooing of the dove); 'ac (in good texts it is written with mercha, not with makkeph) according to <a href="/deuteronomy/16-15.htm">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>. On the construction of the pluralet. shadmoth, compare <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>. We have rendered the clause commencing with baale&#772; goyim (lords of the nations) with the same amphibolism as we find in the Hebrew. It might mean either "lords of the nations (domini gentium) smote down its branches" (viz., those of the vine of Sibmah;<p>(Note: In MSS Shibmah is written with gaya, in order that the two labials may be distinctly expressed.)<p>ha&#770;lam being used as in <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>), or "its branches smote down (i.e., intoxicated) lords of the nations" (dominos gentium; ha&#770;lam having the same meaning as in the undisputed prophecy of Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>). As the prophet enlarges here upon the excellence of the Moabitish wine, the latter is probably intended. The wine of Sibmah was so good, that it was placed upon the tables of monarchs, and so strong that it smote down, i.e., inevitably intoxicated, even those who were accustomed to good wines. This Sibmah wine was cultivated, as the prophet says, far and wide in Moab - northwards as far as Ja'zer (between Ramoth, i.e., Salt, and Heshbon, now a heap of ruins), eastwards into the desert, and southwards across the Dead Sea - a hyperbolical expression for close up to its shores. Jeremiah defines ya&#770;m (the sea) more closely as yam Ja&#8219;zer (the sea of Jazer; vid., <a href="/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>), so that the hyperbole vanishes. But what sea can the sea of Jazer be? Probably some celebrated large pool, like the pools of Heshbon, in which the waters of the Wady (Nahr) Sir, which takes its rise close by, were collected. Seetzen found some pools still there. The "sea" (ya&#770;m) in Solomon's temple shows clearly enough that the term sea was also commonly applied to artificial basins of a large size; and in Damascus the marble basins of flowing water in the halls of houses are still called bahara&#770;t; and the same term is applied to the public reservoirs in all the streets of the city, which are fed by a network of aqueducts from the river Barada&#770;. The expression "break through the desert" (ta&#770;&#8219;u midba&#770;r) is also a bold one, probably pointing to the fact that, like the red wines of Hungary at the present time, they were trailing vines, which did not require to be staked, but ran along the ground. </body></html>
