Interpreters vary greatly concerning the application of this passage. Some refer it entirely to Hezekiah, a pious and just king, whose throne, after the chastisement of Sennacherib in Judea, was established in glory; others refer it immediately to the Messiah; and others again to both: to Hezekiah as the type, and to the Messiah, in a more sublime sense, as the antitype; and this seems to be nearly the opinion of Vitringa, who thinks that while the prophet was speaking of the advantages of the kingdom of Hezekiah, he was carried forward to a contemplation of the kingdom of Christ, and made use of such phrases as, in their full extent, can only be applied to that kingdom.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 God tells sinners what they may do to prevent ruin; so he does to Moab. Let them send the tribute they formerly engaged to pay to Judah. Take it as good advice. Break off thy sins by righteousness, it may lengthen thy quiet. And this may be applied to the great gospel duty of submission to Christ. Send him the lamb, the best you have, yourselves a living sacrifice. When you come to God, the great Ruler, come in the name of the Lamb, the Lamb of God. Those who will not submit to Christ, shall be as a bird that wanders from her nest, which shall be snatched up by the next bird of prey. Those who will not yield to the fear of God, shall be made to yield to the fear of every thing else. He advises them to be kind to the seed of Israel. Those that expect to find favour when in trouble themselves, must show favour to those in trouble. What is here said concerning the throne of Hezekiah, also belongs, in a much higher sense, to the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Though by subjection to Him we may not enjoy worldly riches or honours, but may be exposed to poverty and contempt, we shall have peace of conscience and eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in mercy - In benignity; kindness; benevolence.<p>Shall the throne be established - The throne of the king of Judah.

His character shall be such that he will do justice, and will furnish protection and aid to the Moabites, if they now receive the fugitives of Israel.<p>In the tabernacle of David - In the dwelling place; the palace of David; for so the word "tabernacle, or tent" (&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;  'o&#770;hel) seems to be used here. It means "temple" in <a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>. It denotes a habitation, or dwelling place, in general, in <a href="/proverbs/14-11.htm">Proverbs 14:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a>. The palace, court, or "citadel" of David, was on mount Zion; and the sense here is, that the king to whom Israel refers would be a worthy successor of David - just, true, faithful, benignant, and disposed to repay the favors now sought at the hand of Moab.<p>Seeking judgment - Anxious to do right; and seeking an opportunity to recompense those who had shown any favor to the people of the Jews. Moab, therefore, if she would now afford protection to the Jews, might be certain of a recompense.<p>And hasting righteousness - Not tardy and slow in doing what should be done - anxious to do justice to all. It is implied here also, that a king who would be so just, and so anxious to do "right" to all, would not only be ready to show kindness to the Moabites, if they protected the fugitives of Judea, but would also be disposed to do "right" if they refused that protection; that is, would be disposed to inflict "punishment" on them. Alike, therefore, by the hope of the protection and favor of the king of the Jews, and by the dread of punishment, the prophet endeavors to persuade Moab now to secure their favor by granting protection to their exiles. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

That is, the throne of Hezekiah, and his government over Judah, which was more firmly settled and established after the overthrow of the Assyrian army, through the mercy of God vouchsafed to him, and on account of the mercy he exercised among his subjects, see <a href="/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>. Hezekiah was a type of Christ, and his throne typical of his, and the ultimate view of the prophecy may be to the stability of the kingdom of Christ; so the Targum, <p>"then the Christ of Israel, his throne shall be established in goodness:'' <p>and he shall sit upon it in truth; which does not so much intend the reality of his sitting there, as his continuance, signified by sitting, and the constancy and stability of his reign, or his governing with faith fulness and truth; <p>in the tabernacle of David; or "tent"; meaning his palace, or house in Jerusalem, alluding to his having been a shepherd before he was a king, or referring to the unsettled state of David's house; this was typical of the church of God, where Christ sits and reigns as King, see <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>; the Targum is, <p>"in the city of David;'' <p>Jerusalem, as Aben Ezra: <p>judging and seeking judgment; acting the part of a righteous, faithful, and diligent Judge; seeking to do justice to the poor and needy, and searching into the cause that comes before him, to find out, and take the right side of it: <p>and hasting righteousness; not delaying justice, protracting a cause, deferring the sentence, and the execution of it, but dispatching the whole as speedily as may be; all which characters, though they may be found in Hezekiah, yet are much more eminently in Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in mercy shall the throne be established: <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and swiftly executing righteousness.</span><p>(e) Meaning, Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">And in mercy</span>] If we follow Hitzig’s view of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm" title="Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be you a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortionist is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.">Isaiah 16:4</a></span> this would be rendered “then in mercy.” The phraseology of the verse is Messianic (see esp. ch. <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>) but not exclusively so (cf. <a href="/proverbs/8-28.htm" title="When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:">Proverbs 8:28</a>).

A Messianic vision comes upon the prophet in connection with the disappearance of the oppressor. There shall be one day - he knows not how soon or how late - a throne established in mercy, and "One shall be seated upon it in truth, who. shall occupy the tent [or, 'house'] of David, as one who judges, and seeks justice, and hastens on [the reign of] righteousness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Moabitis has thus become a great scene of conflagration, the Moabites cross the border and fly to Idumaea. The reason for this is given in sentences which the prophet again links on to one another with the particle ci (for). "Therefore what has been spared, what has been gained, and their provision, they carry it over the willow-brook. For the scream has gone the round in the territory of Moab; the wailing of Joab resounds to Eglayim, and his wailing to Beeer-Elim. For the waters of Dimon are full of blood: for I suspend over Dimon a new calamity, over the escaped of Moab a lion, and over the remnant of the land." Yithra&#770;h is what is superfluous or exceeds the present need, and pekudda&#770;h (lit. a laying up, depositio) that which has been carefully stored; whilst &#8219;a&#770;sa&#770;h, as the derivative passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>, clearly shows (although the accusative in the whole of <a href="/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a> is founded upon a different view: see Rashi), is an attributive clause (what has been made, worked out, or gained). All these things they carry across nachal ha&#770;&#8219;ara&#770;bim, i.e., not the desert-stream, as Hitzig, Maurer, Ewald, and Knobel suppose, since the plural of &#8219;ara&#770;ba&#770;h is &#8219;ara&#770;both, but either the Arab stream (lxx, Saad.), or the willow-stream, torrens salicum (Vulg.). The latter is more suitable to the connection; and among the rivers which flow to the south of the Arnon from the mountains of the Moabitish highlands down to the Dead Sea, there is one which is called Wadi Sufsaf, i.e., willow-brook (Tzaphtzphh is the name of a brook in Hebrew also), viz., the northern arm of the Seil el-Kerek. This is what we suppose to be intended here, and not the Wadi el-Ahsa, although the latter (probably the biblical Zered<p>(Note: Hence the Targ. II renders nachal zered "the brook of the willows." See Buxtorf, Lex. chald. s.v. Zerad.))<p>is the boundary river on the extreme south, and separates Moab from Edom (Kerek from Gebal: see Ritter, Erdk. xv 1223-4). Wading through the willow-brook, they carry their possessions across, and hurry off to the land of Edom, for their own land has become the prey of the foe throughout its whole extent, and within its boundaries the cry of wailing passes from Eglayim, on the south-west of Ar, and therefore not far from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea (<a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>), as far as Beer-elim, in the north-east of the land towards the desert (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-16.htm">Numbers 21:16-18</a>; &#1506;&#1491; must be supplied: Ewald, 351, a), that is to say, if we draw a diagonal through the land, from one end to the other. Even the waters of Dibon, which are called Dimon here to produce a greater resemblance in sound to da&#770;m, blood, and by which we are probably to understand the Arnon, as this was only a short distance off (just as in <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> the "waters of Megiddo" are the Kishon), are full of blood,<p>(Note: &#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, with munach (which also represents the metheg) at the first syllable of the verb (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>, &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, with mercha), according to Vened. 1521, and other good editions. This is also grammatically correct.) <p>so that the enemy must have penetrated into the very heart of the land in his course of devastation and slaughter. But what drives them across the willow-brook is not this alone; it is as if they forebode that what has hitherto occurred is not the worst or the last. Jehovah suspends (shith, as in <a href="/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>) over Dibon, whose waters are already reddened with blood, no&#772;sa&#770;pho&#772;th, something to be added, i.e., a still further judgment, namely a lion. The measure of Moab's misfortunes is not yet full: after the northern enemy, a lion will come upon those that have escaped by flight or have been spared at home (on the expression itself, compare <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>, and other passages). This lion is no other than the basilisk of the prophecy against Philistia, but with this difference, that the basilisk represents one particular Davidic king, whilst the lion is Judah generally, whose emblem was the lion from the time of Jacob's blessing, in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>. </body></html>
