Let them send the tribute they formerly engaged to pay to Judah. Take it as good advice. Break off thy sins by righteousness, it may lengthen thy quiet. And this may be applied to the great gospel duty of submission to Christ. Send him the lamb, the best you have, yourselves a living sacrifice. When you come to God, the great Ruler, come in the name of the Lamb, the Lamb of God. Those who will not submit to Christ, shall be as a bird that wanders from her nest, which shall be snatched up by the next bird of prey. Those who will not yield to the fear of God, shall be made to yield to the fear of every thing else. He advises them to be kind to the seed of Israel. Those that expect to find favour when in trouble themselves, must show favour to those in trouble. What is here said concerning the throne of Hezekiah, also belongs, in a much higher sense, to the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Though by subjection to Him we may not enjoy worldly riches or honours, but may be exposed to poverty and contempt, we shall have peace of conscience and eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it shall be - It shall happen in the time of the calamity that shall come upon Moab.<p>As a wandering bird - (See <a href="/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a>.) The same idea is presented in <a href="/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8</a> :<p>As a bird that wanders from her nest,<p>So is a man that wandereth from his place.<p>The idea here is that of a bird driven away from her nest, where the nest is destroyed, and the young fly about without any home or place of rest. So would Moab be when the inhabitants were driven from their dwellings. The reason why this is introduced seems to be, to enforce what the prophet had said in the previous verse - the duty of paying the usual tribute to the Jews, and seeking their protection. The time is coming, says the prophet, when the Moabites shall be driven from their homes, and when they will need that protection which they can obtain by paying the usual tribute to the Jews.<p>The daughters of Moab - The females shall be driven from their homes, and shall wander about, and endeavor to flee from the invasion which has come upon the land. By the apprehension, therefore, that their wives and daughters would be exposed to this danger, the prophet calls upon the Moabites to secure the protection of the king of Judah.<p>At the fords of Arnon - Arnon was the northern boundary of the land of Moab. They would endeavor to cross that river, and thus flee from the land, and escape the desolations that were coming upon it. The river Arnon, now called Mujeb, flows in a deep, frightfully wild, and rocky vale of the same name <a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>, in a narrow bed, and forms at this time the boundary between the provinces of Belka and Karrak (Seetzen). Bridges were not common in the times here referred to; and, indeed, permanent bridges among the ancients were things almost unknown. Hence, they selected the places where the streams were most shallow and gentle, as the usual places of crossing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. cast out of &#8230; nest&#8212;rather, "as a brood cast out" (in apposition with "a wandering bird," or rather, wandering birds), namely, a brood just fledged and expelled from the nest in which they were hatched [Horsley].

The Lamed in l'Moab is the same both here and in <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a> as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8-9</a>, viz., "turned toward Moab." Moab, which was masculine in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>, is feminine here. We may infer from this that &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1510;&#1506;&#1512; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; is a statement which concerns Moab as a land. Now, berichim signifies the bolts in every other passage in which it occurs; and it is possible to speak of the bolts of a land with just as much propriety as in <a href="/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a> (cf., <a href="/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a>) of the bolts of a city. And the statement that the bolts of this land went to Zoar is also a very appropriate one, for Kir Moab and Zoar formed the southern fortified girdle of the land; and Zoar, on the south-western tongue of land which runs into the Dead Sea, was the uttermost fortress of Moab, looking over towards Judah; and in its depressed situation below the level of the sea it formed, as it were, the opposite pole of Kir Moab, the highest point in the high land itself. Hence we agree with Jerome, who adopts the rendering vectes ejus usque ad Segor, whereas all the modern translators have taken the word in the sense of fugitives. &#8219;Eglath sheilshiyya&#770;h, which Rosenmller, Knobel, Drechsler, Meier, and others have taken quite unnecessarily as a proper name, is either in apposition to Zoar or to Moab. In the former case it is a distinguishing epithet. An ox of the three years, or more literally of the third year (cf., meshullesheth, <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a>), i.e., a three-year-old ox, is one that is still in all the freshness and fulness of its strength, and that has not yet been exhausted by the length of time that it has worn the yoke. The application of the term to the Moabitish nation is favoured by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>, where Egypt is called "a very fair heifer" (&#8219;egla&#770;h yephe&#772;h-phiyya&#770;h), whilst Babylon is called the same in <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a> (cf., <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>). And in the same way, according to the lxx, Vulg., Targum, and Gesenius, Moab is called juvenca tertii anni, h. e. indomita jugoque non assueta, as a nation that was still in the vigour of youth, and if it had hitherto borne the yoke, had always shaken it off again. But the application of it to Zoar is favoured (1.) by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>, where this epithet is applied to another Moabitish city; (2.) by the accentuation; and (3.) by the fact that in the other case we should expect ber&#305;&#772;cha&#770;h (the three-year-old heifer, i.e., Moab, is a fugitive to Zoar: vid., Luzzatto). Thus Zoar, the fine, strong, and hitherto unconquered city, is now the destination of the wildest flight before the foe that is coming from the north. A blow has fallen upon Joab, that is more terrible than any that has preceded it.<p>In a few co-ordinate clauses the prophet now sets before us the several scenes of mourning and desolation. "for the mountain slope of Luhith they ascend with weeping; for on the road to Horonayim they lift up a cry of despair. For the waters of Nimrim are waste places from this time forth: for the grass is dried up, the vegetation wasteth away, the green is gone." The road to Luhith (according to the Onom. between Ar-Moab and Zoar, and therefore in the centre of Moabitis proper) led up a height, and the road to Horonayim (according to <a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a>) down a slope. Weeping, they ran up to the mountain city to hide themselves there (bo, as in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>; in <a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a> it is written incorrectly &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;). Raising loud cries of despair, they stand in front of Horonayim, which lay below, and was more exposed to the enemy. &#1497;&#1506;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is softened from &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (possibly to increase the resemblance to an echo), like &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;. The Septuagint renders it very well, &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; - an unaccustomed expression of intense and ever renewed cries at the threatening danger of utter destruction, and with the hope of procuring relief and assistance (sheber, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). From the farthest south the scene would suddenly be transferred to the extreme north of the territory of Moab, if Nimrim were the Nimra (Beth-Nimra, Talm. nimrin) which was situated near to the Jordan in Gilead, and therefore farther north than any of the places previously mentioned, and the ruins of which lie a little to the south of Salt, and are still called Nimrin. But the name itself, which is derived from the vicinity of fresh water (Arab. nemir, nem&#305;&#772;r, clear, pure, sound), is one of frequent occurrence; and even to the south of Moabitis proper there is a Wadi Numere, and a brook called Moyet Numere (two diminutives: "dear little stream of Nimra"), which flows through stony tracks, and which formerly watered the country (Burckhardt, Seetzen, and De Saulcy). In all probability the ruins of Numere by the side of this wady are the Nimrim referred to here, and the waters of the brook the "waters of Nimrim" (me Nimrim). The waters that flowed fresh from the spring had been filled up with rubbish by the enemy, and would now probably lie waste for ever (a similar expression to that in <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>). He had gone through the land scorching and burning, so that all the vegetation had vanished. On the miniature-like short sentences, see <a href="/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>; and on &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; ("it is not in existence," or "it has become not," i.e., annihilated), vid., <a href="/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>. </body></html>
