When the Lord, by his Spirit, made the world, none directed his Spirit, or gave advice what to do, or how to do it. The nations, in comparison of him, are as a drop which remains in the bucket, compared with the vast ocean; or as the small dust in the balance, which does not turn it, compared with all the earth. This magnifies God's love to the world, that, though it is of such small account and value with him, yet, for the redemption of it, he gave his only-begotten Son, Joh 3:16. The services of the church can make no addition to him. Our souls must have perished for ever, if the only Son of the Father had not given himself for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the nations - All the nations of the earth. This is designed to show the greatness of God, in comparison with that which strikes man as great - a mighty nation; and the main object seems to be, to show that God could accomplish his purposes without their aid, and that they could not resist him in the execution of his plans. If they were as nothing in comparison with him, how easily could he execute his purposes! If they were as nothing, how little could they resist the execution of his plans!<p>Are as a drop of a bucket - In comparison with him; or are so esteemed by him. The drop that falls from the bucket in drawing water is a trifle. It has no power, and compared with the waters of the ocean it is as nothing. So small is the power of the nations in comparison with God. "And are counted." Are thought of, regarded, esteemed by him, or in comparison with him.<p>As the small dust of the balance - The small, fine dust which collects on the best finished and most accurate balance or scales, and which has no effect in making the scales uneven, or making either side preponderate. Nothing can be a more striking representation of the fact that the nations are regarded as nothing in comparison with God.<p>Behold, he taketh up the isles - Or he is able to do it; he could remove the isles as the fine dust is driven before the whirlwind. A more literal translation of this passage would be, 'Lo, the isles are as the dust which is taken up,' or which one takes up; that is, which is taken up, and carried away by the wind. There is something unusual in the expression that God takes up the isles, and the idea is rather that the isles in his sight are regarded as the fine dust which the wind sweeps away. So the Chaldee renders it, 'Lo, the isles are like ashes which the wind drives away.' The word 'isles,' Vitringa and Jerome regard as denoting not the small portions of land in the sea that are surrounded by water, but lands which are encompassed and enclosed Mesopotamia. But there is no reason why it should not be taken here in its usual signification, as denoting the islands of the sea. They would serve well to be used in connection with mountains and hills in setting forth the vast power of God.<p>As a very little thing - (&#1499;&#1491;&#1511;  keddaq). The word &#1491;&#1511;  daq means theft which is beaten small, or fine; and then fine dust, chaff, or any light thing which the wind easily sweeps away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. of&#8212;rather, (hanging) from a bucket [Maurer].<p>he taketh up &#8230; as a very little thing&#8212;rather, "are as a mere grain of dust which is taken up," namely, by the wind; literally, "one taketh up," impersonally (Ex 16:14) [Maurer].<p>isles&#8212;rather, "lands" in general, answering to "the nations" in the parallel clause; perhaps lands, like Mesopotamia, enclosed by rivers [Jerome] (so Isa 42:15). However, English Version, "isles" answers well to "mountains" (Isa 40:12), both alike being lifted up by the power of God; in fact, "isles" are mountains upheaved from the bed of the sea by volcanic agency; only that he seems here to have passed from unintelligent creatures (Isa 40:12) to intelligent, as nations and lands, that is, their inhabitants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The nations, </span> all the nations of the world, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">are as a drop of a bucket, </span> compared with all the water in the bucket, wherein are innumerable drops: such are they if compared with God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And are counted</span> by him, and in comparison of him, as the small dust of the balance; which accidentally cleaves to the balance, but makes no alteration in the weight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The isles; </span> those numerous and vast countries to which they went from Judea by sea, which are commonly called isles, as hath been oft observed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket,.... Not only the Chaldeans and Babylonians, and other nations most known, and most troublesome to the Jews, but all the nations of the world; these, in comparison of God, of his infinite and immense Being, are but as a drop of water that hangs upon the bucket, or falls from it, when water is drawn by it, or is left in it, when poured out of it; which is nothing in comparison of the well out of which the water is drawn, or even of the water in the bucket drawn out of it: <p>and are accounted as the small dust of the balance; that is, they are accounted nothing of with God, comparatively speaking, any more than the small dust which hangs upon the balance, and gives it no weight, nor turn one way or another, and so is of no consideration. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "as the turn of the scale"; and so the Targum; but the other version more strongly expresses the sense: <p>behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing; by which are meant not merely islands, properly so called, which are encompassed by the sea, but all such countries which the Jews used to go to by sea, for all such they called isles; these the Lord can take up, or cast away (u), as some render the word; toss them about, overturn and destroy, as a man may take up the most minute thing and cast it from him. The Targum renders it, <p>"as chaff which flies away;'' <p>or, as others translate it, <p>"as the ashes of a coal which fly away.'' <p>The word may signify any light thing, as chaff, straw, stubble, feathers, down of thistles, which are easily carried away with the least force; and so Vitringa renders the words, "behold, the isles are as some little thing which flies away". <p>(u) "projiciet", Pagninus, Tigurine version; so R.

Etymologically it probably means simply “habitable lands”; and this prophet uses it with great laxity, hardly distinguishing it from “lands” (see esp. ch. <a href="/isaiah/42-15.htm" title="I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.">Isaiah 42:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as a very little thing</span>] “a grain of powder,” used of the manna, <a href="/exodus/16-14.htm" title="And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.">Exodus 16:14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket</span>. "From nature," as Mr. Cheyne says, "we pass to history." If God is so great, so apart and by himself in relation to the material universe, what is he in relation to man? What are nations, compared to him, but "as a drop from a bucket," which drips from it, and is of no account? What are they, but as the small dust of the balance, which lies on it but does not disturb its equilibrium? They are absolutely "as nothing" (ver. 17) - vanity and emptiness, <span class="cmt_word">He taketh up the isles as a very little thing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he taketh up islands</span>, or perhaps <span class="accented">lands</span> generally. As he weighs mountains and hills in his balance (ver. 15), so he can take up in his own hands "lands," or "countries" (Cheyne), with all their inhabitants, and do with them as seemeth him good. They are no burden to him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet accordingly now takes, as his standpoint, the time when Jehovah will already have come. "Upon a high mountain get thee up, O evangelistess Zion; lift up they voice with strength, evangelistess Jerusalem: lift up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God." Knobel and others follow the lxx and Targum, and regard Zion and Jerusalem as accusatives of the object, viz., "preacher of salvation (i.e., a chorus of preachers) to Zion-Jerusalem;" but such parallels as <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a> are misleading here. The words are in apposition (A. S. Th. &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;). Zion-Jerusalem herself is called an evangelistess: the personification as a female renders this probable at the outset, and it is placed beyond all doubt by the fact, that it is the cities of Judah (the daughters of Zion-Jerusalem) that are to be evangelized. The prophet's standpoint here is in the very midst of the parousia. When Jerusalem shall have her God in the midst of her once more, after He has broken up His home there for so long a time; she is then, as the restored mother-community, to ascend a high mountain, and raising her voice with fearless strength, to bring to her daughters the joyful news of the appearance of their God. The verb bisse&#772;r signifies literally to smooth, to unfold, then to make glad, more especially with joyful news.<p>(Note: The verb bisse&#772;r signifies primarily to stroke, rub, shave, or scratch the surface of anything; then to stroke off or rub off the surface, or anything which covers it; then, suggested by the idea of "rubbing smooth" (glatt), "to smooth a person" (jemanden gltten; compare the English, to gladden a person), i.e., vultum ejus diducere, to make him friendly and cheerful, or "to look smoothly upon a person," i.e., to show him a friendly face; and also as an intransitive, "to be glad," to be friendly and cheerful; and lastly, in a general sense, aliquid attingere, tractare, attrectare, to grasp or handle a thing (from which comes ba&#770;sa&#770;r, the flesh, as something tangible or material). In harmony with the Hebrew bisse&#772;r (<a href="/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15</a>), they say in Arabic basarahu (or intensive, bassarahu) bi-maulu&#770;din, he has gladdened him with the news of the birth of a son.)<p>It lies at the root of the New Testament &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (evangelize), and is a favourite word of the author of chapters 40-66, that Old Testament evangelist, though it is no disproof of Isaiah's authorship (cf., <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a>). Hitherto Jerusalem has been in despair, bowed down under the weight of the punishment of her sins, and standing in need of consolation. But now that she has Jehovah with her again, she is to lift up her voice with the most joyful confidence, without further anxiety, and to become, according to her true vocation, the messenger of good tidings to all Judaea. </body></html>
