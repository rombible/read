A “wind of Jehovah” would be a mighty storm-blast, tearing up the grass and hurling it to destruction.

Troubles are removed in love, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death of Christ, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. In Christ, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's hand double for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by his death was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to the return of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, compared with that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when John the Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princes marched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, and hinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by the teaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high and proud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked and rugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderance removed, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared for his heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or all that he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what will all the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leave him under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, which all flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to be sent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; but our Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that he purposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for young converts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his word he requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd's voice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The grass withereth - Soon withers. Its beauty is soon gone.<p>The flower fadeth - Soon fades; or fades when the wind of Yahweh passes over it. So is also with man. He loses his vigor, and dies at once when Yahweh takes away his strength and beauty.<p>Because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it - This should be rendered, undoubtedly, 'When the wind of Yahweh bloweth upon it.' The word 'spirit' here does not suit the connection, and does not express the idea of the prophet. The word &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach means, properly, "breath" - a breathing, or blowing; and is often used indeed to denote spirit, soul, life. But it often means a breath of wind; a breeze; air in motion <a href="/job/41-8.htm">Job 41:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>. It is applied to the cool breeze which springs up in the evening (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; compare Sol 2:17; Sol 4:6). It sometimes means a strong and violent wind <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; and also a tempest, or hurricane <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>. The 'wind of Yahweh' means that which Yahweh sends, or causes; and the expression here refers, doubtless, to the hot or poisonous east winds which blow in Oriental countries, and which wither and dry up everything before them (compare <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>).<p>Surely the people is grass - Lowth reads this, 'this people;' referring to the Jewish nation. So the Syriac. Perhaps it refers to the people of Babylon (so Rosenmuller), and means that mighty people would fade away like grass. But the more probable interpretation is that which regards it as referring to all people, and of course including the Jews and the Babylonians. The sense, according to this view, is, 'all nations shall fade away. All human power shall cease. But the promise of Yahweh shall survive. It shall be unchanging amidst all revolutions; it shall survive all the fluctuations which shall take place among people. It may, therefore, be trusted with unwavering reliance.' To produce that reliance was the object of the proclamation. On this passage, descriptive of the state of man, the reader will at once be reminded of the beautiful language of Shakespeare:<p>This is the state of man! Today he puts forth<p>The tender leaves of hope: to-morrow blossoms,<p>And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;<p>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,<p>And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely<p>His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,<p>And then he falls - <p> - Never to hope again.<p>Hen.

The words at best are a flat repetition of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm" title="The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?

Either a mere repetition of "all flesh is grass" (ver. 6) with an asseveration, or an intimation that "the people" of Israel is not exempt from the lot of mankind in general, but shares it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this first address the prophet vindicates his call to be the preacher of the comfort of the approaching deliverance, and explains this comfort on the ground that Jehovah, who called him to this comforting proclamation, was the incomparably exalted Creator and Ruler of the world. The first part of this address (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-11</a>) may be regarded as the prologue to the whole twenty-seven. The theme of the prophetic promise, and the irresistible certainty of its fulfilment, are here declared. Turning of the people of the captivity, whom Jehovah has neither forgotten nor rejected, the prophet commences thus in <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> : "Comfort ye, comfort ye may people, saith your God." This is the divine command to the prophets. Nacha&#774;mu&#772; (piel, literally, to cause to breathe again) is repeated, because of its urgency (anadiplosis, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, etc.). The word &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, which does not mean "will say" here (Hofmann, Stier), but "saith" (lxx, Jerome) - as, for example, in <a href="/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> - affirms that the command is a continuous one. The expression "saith your God" is peculiar to Isaiah, and common to both parts of the collection (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>). The future in all these passages is expressive of that which is taking place or still continuing. And it is the same here. The divine command has not been issued once only, or merely to one prophet, but is being continually addressed to many prophets. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people," is the continual charge of the God of the exiles. who has not ceased to be their God even in the midst of wrath, to His messengers and heralds the prophets. </body></html>
