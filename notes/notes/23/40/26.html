He that is so poor, that he has scarcely a sacrifice to offer, yet will not be without a god of his own. They spared no cost upon their idols; we grudge what is spent in the service of our God. To prove the greatness of God, the prophet appeals to all ages and nations. Those who are ignorant of this, are willingly ignorant. God has the command of all creatures, and of all created things. The prophet directs us to use our reason as well as our senses; to consider who created the hosts of heaven, and to pay our homage to Him. Not one fails to fulfil his will. And let us not forget, that He spake all the promises, and engaged to perform them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up your eyes on high - Direct your eyes toward heaven, and in the contemplation of the wonders of the starry world, and of God's power there, learn the evidence of his ability to destroy his foes and to save his friends. Lowth connects this verse with the former, and renders it:<p>'Saith the Holy One,<p>Lift up your eyes on high.'<p>The words 'on high' here are evidently synonymous with heaven, and refer to the starry worlds. The design of the passage is to convince them of the folly of idolatry, and of the power and majesty, of the true God. It is proof of man's elevated nature that he can thus look upward, and trace the evidences of the power and wisdom of God in the heavens; that he can raise his eyes and thoughts above the earth, and fix his attention on the works of God in distant worlds; and in the number, the order, the greatness, and the harmony of the heavenly bodies, trace the proofs of the infinite greatness and the wisdom of God. This thought was most beautifully expressed by one of the ancient poets.<p>Pronaque cum spectent animalia caetera terram;<p>Os homini sublime dedit: ccelumque tueri,<p>Jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus.<p>Ovid, Met. i.-84-86.<p>In the Scriptures, God not unfrequently appeals to the starry heavens in proof of his existence and perfections, and as the most sublime exhibition of his greatness and power (see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-6</a>). And it may be remarked, that this argument is one that increases in strength, in the view of people, from age to age, just in proportion to the advances which are made in the science of astronomy. It is now far more striking than it was in the times of Isaiah; and, indeed, the discoveries in astronomical science in modern times have given a beauty and power to this argument which could have been but imperfectly understood in the times of the prophets. The argument is one that accumulates with every new discovery in astronomy; but is one - such is the vastness and beauty of the system of the universe - which can be contemplated in its fall power only amidst the more sublime contemplations of eternity. Those who are disposed to contemplate this argument more fully, may find it presented with great eloquence and beauty in Dr. Chalmers' Astronomical Discourses, and in Dick's Christian Philosopher.<p>Who hath created these things - These heavens. This is the first evidence of the power of God in the contemplation of the heavens, that God is their Creator. The other demonstrations referred to are the fact, that he brings out their armies as if they were a marshalled host, and understands and calls all their names.<p>That bringeth out their hosts - Their armies, for so the word 'hosts' means (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>). The word here alludes to the fact that the heavenly bodies seem to be marshalled, or regularly arrayed as an array; that they keep their place, preserve their order, and are apparently led on from the east to the west, like a vast army under a mighty leader:<p>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?<p>Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. bringeth out &#8230; host&#8212;image from a general reviewing his army: He is Lord of Sabaoth, the heavenly hosts (Job 38:32).<p>calleth &#8230; by names&#8212;numerous as the stars are. God knows each in all its distinguishing characteristics&#8212;a sense which "name" often bears in Scripture; so in Ge 2:19, 20, Adam, as God's vicegerent, called the beasts by name, that is, characterized them by their several qualities, which, indeed, He has imparted.<p>by the greatness &#8230; faileth&#8212;rather, "by reason of abundance of (their inner essential) force and firmness of strength, not one of them is driven astray"; referring to the sufficiency of the physical forces with which He has endowed the heavenly bodies, to prevent all disorder in their motions [Horsley]. In English Version the sense is, "He has endowed them with their peculiar attributes ('names') by the greatness of His might," and the power of His strength (the better rendering, instead of, "for that He is strong").<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Lift up your eyes on high; </span> to the high and starry heaven as appears from the following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">These things</span> which you see on high, the host of heaven, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That bringeth out; </span> that at first brought them out of nothing, and from day to day brings them forth, making them to rise and set in their appointed and fixed times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their host by number, </span> as a general brings forth his army into the field, and there musters them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He calleth them all by names, </span> as a master calleth all the members of his family. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For that he is strong in power; </span> which work is a certain and evident proof of God’s infinite power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not one faileth, </span> either to appear when he calleth them, or to do the work to which he sends them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Lift up your eyes on high,....

Kimchi gives the sense thus, that according to the virtue and efficacy that there is in every star, so is its name; and because of the strength and power that is in everyone of them, they remain unchangeably and unalterably the same as when they were first created; which not only holds true of the sun and moon, but of the stars lesser and greater. The Targum is, <p>"because of the multitude of strength, and the power of might, not one is hindered from its order;'' <p>wherefore, as there is no likeness on earth, so none in heaven, with which the Lord is to be likened, or to which he can be equalled. This may respect not the might and power of the Lord, in supporting and maintaining these creatures in their being and usefulness; but the strength and power of the mightiest creatures, to hinder their influence and service: for the words may be rendered, "through the multitude of strength", or anyone being "strong in power, not one indeed fails (d)"; or is wanting, that is, through the strength or power of the mightiest creatures, angels or men, the hosts of heaven cannot be stopped in their course, or hindered in their work appointed to do, or be deprived of their being. <p>(d)       "prae multitudine virium, et robore virtutis, ut ne unum quidem deesset", Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these <i>things</i>, that bringeth <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that <i>he is</i> strong in power; not one faileth.</span><p>(b) Who has set in order the infinite number of the stars.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">and behold who hath created</span>] Better as R.V. marg.: <span class="bld">and see: who hath created these?</span> The word “create” occurs fifteen times in ch. 40–55 and five times in the chapters which follow; perhaps not more than nine times in the whole of the <span class="ital">earlier</span> literature.
