Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man according to his works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For so the Lord said unto me - So Yahweh has revealed his purpose, that is, to execute punishment on the people who have been described in the previous verses. Their state as there described is that of a fierce people making ready for war, and probably designing an alliance with the enemies of Judea, and marshalling their armies for that purpose. Yahweh here reveals to the prophet that they shall be discomfited, and shows the manner in which it will be done. He says he will sit calm while these preparations are going on - as the sun shines serenely on the earth while the harvest is growing, and the dew falls gently on the herb; but that "before" their plans are completed, he will interpose and destroy them, as if one should appear suddenly before the harvest is ripe and cut it down. The "design," therefore, of this part of the prophecy is to comfort the Jews, and to assure them that there is no danger to them from the preparations which were made against them - for Yahweh calmly beholds the proud rage of the enemy.<p>I will take my rest - I will not interpose. I will remain calm - not appearing to oppose them, but keeping as calm, and as still, as if I seemed to favor their plans - as the sun shines on the herb, and the gentle dew falls on the grass, until the proper time for me to interpose and defeat them shall arise <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5-6</a>.<p>I will consider - I will look on; that is, I will not now interpose and disarrange their plans before they are complete. We learn here,<p>(1) That God sees the plans of the wicked;<p>(2) That he sees them "mature" them without attempting then to interpose to disarrange them;<p>(3) That he is calm and still, because he designs that those plans shall be developed; and<p>(4) That the wicked should not indulge in any dreams of security and success because God does not interpose to thwart their plans while they are forming them. He will do it in the proper time.<p>In my dwelling-place - In heaven. I will sit in heaven and contemplate leisurely the plans that are going forward.<p>Like a clear heat - A serene, calm, and steady sunshine, by which plants and herbs are made to grow. There seem to be two ideas blended here: the first, that of the "stillness" with which the sun shines upon the herbs; and the other, that of the fact that the sun shines that the herbs "may grow."<p>Upon herbs - Margin, 'After rain' (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#774;le&#772;y 'o&#770;ry). The word &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;  'o&#770;r usually signifies "light," or "fire." The plural form (&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;  o&#770;'o&#770;ro&#770;th) is used to denote herbs or vegetables in two places, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>. For in the Shemitic languages the ideas of "sprouting, being grown, growing" etc., are connected with that of the shining of the sun, or of light; that which grows in the light; that is, vegetables. But in the singular phorm the word is not thus used, unless it be in this place. That it may have this signiphication cannot be doubted; and this interpretation makes good sense, and suits the connection. The rabbis generally interpret it as it is in the margin - 'rain.' In proof of this they appeal to <a href="/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30</a>; <a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>; but the word in these passages more properly denotes a cloud of light or of lightning, than rain. The common interpretation is probably correct, which regards the word &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;  'o&#770;r here as the same as &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  'o&#770;ra&#770;h - 'herbs' (see Vitringa). The Syriac reads it &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;  &#8219;al-yeor - 'upon the river.' The parallelism seems to require the sense of "herb," or something that shall answer to 'harvest' in the corresponding member.<p>And like a cloud of dew - Such a dew was still, and promoted the growth of vegetables. The idea is that of stillness and rest where there is no storm or tempest to dissipate the gently-falling dew. This is an emblem of the perfect quietness with which God would regard the preparations for war until the proper time would come for him to interpose. The whole passage is similar to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4-5</a> :<p>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh;<p>Jehovah shall have them in derision.<p>Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. take &#8230; rest &#8230; consider&#8212;I will calmly look on and not interpose, while all seems to promise success to the enemy; when figuratively, "the sun's heat" and "the night dews" ripen their "harvest"; but "before" it reaches its maturity I will destroy it (Isa 18:5; Ec 8:11, 12).<p>like a clear heat&#8212;rather, "at the time of the clear (serene) heat" [Maurer].<p>upon herbs&#8212;answering to "harvest" in the parallel clause. Maurer translates, "in the sunlight" (Job 31:26; 37:21; Hab 3:4).<p>like &#8230; dew&#8212;rather, "at the time of the dew cloud." God's "silence" is mistaken by the ungodly for consent; His delay in taking vengeance for forgetfulness (Ps 50:21); so it shall be before the vengeance which in the last day shall usher in the restoration of the Jews (Isa 34:1-8; 57:11, end of the verse, 2Pe 3:3-10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will take my rest, </span> I will sit still, and not bestir myself, either to help this people, or to hinder their enemies.

It is the destruction of Asshur that the prophet is predicting here (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-8</a>, etc.), though not of Asshur as Asshur, but of Asshur as the imperial kingdom, which embraced a multitude of nations (<a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-26.htm">Isaiah 14:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>) all gathered together under the rule of one will, to make a common attack upon the church of God.

In the expression "it" (bo) in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>, the many surging nations are kneaded together, as it were, into one mass. It costs God simply a threatening word; and this mass all flies apart (mimmercha&#770;k like me&#772;ra&#770;cho&#772;k, <a href="/isaiah/23-7.htm">Isaiah 23:7</a>), and falls into dust, and whirls about in all directions, like the chaff of threshing-floors in high situations, or like dust whirled up by the storm. The judgment commences in the evening, and rages through the night; and before the morning dawns, the army of nations raised by the imperial power is all destroyed (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>, and the fulfilment in <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>). The fact that the oracle concerning Damascus in its fourth stage takes so comprehensive and, so far as Israel is concerned, so promising a form, may be explained on the ground that Syria was the forerunner of Asshur in the attack upon Israel, and that the alliance between Israel and Syria became the occasion of the complications with Asshur. If the substance of the massa&#770; Dammesek (the oracle concerning Damascus) had been restricted to the prophecy contained in the name Mahershalal, the element of promise so characteristic of the prophecies against the nations of the world would be entirely wanting. But the shout of triumph, "This is the portion," etc., supplied a terminal point, beyond which the massa could not go without the sacrifice of its unity. We are therefore warranted in regarding <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-7</a> as an independent prophecy, notwithstanding its commencement, which apparently forms a continuation of the fourth strophe of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-14</a>. </body></html>
