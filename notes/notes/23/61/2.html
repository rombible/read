The clause seems to have an especial reference to the time in which God punished the unbelieving and disobedient Jews by the destruction of Jerusalem, and the unparalleled calamities that came upon their nation. We find Christ, in several of his discourses, threatening them with the judgments of God for their rejecting him. And he calls the destruction of Jerusalem <span class="ital">the days of vengeance, </span><a href="/luke/21-22.htm" title="For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.">Luke 21:22</a>, the very expression made use of here. <span class="ital">To comfort all that mourn </span>— Either on account of their sins, or their sufferings, or the desolations and miseries of the spiritual Zion, his church; and who, mourning, seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. He not only provides comfort for them, and proclaims it, but he applies and bestows it by giving them the Comforter. There is enough in him to comfort all that mourn, whatever their afflictions or sorrows may be; but this comfort is sure to them that <span class="ital">mourn in Zion, </span>that is, that <span class="ital">sorrow after a godly sort, </span>and apply by faith and prayer to God in Christ for relief and consolation. <span class="ital">To appoint unto them beauty </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">ornament, </span>(as the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">פאר</span>more properly signifies,) <span class="ital">for ashes. </span>Bishop Lowth renders the clause, <span class="ital">To give them a beautiful crown instead of ashes; the oil of gladness instead of sorrow; </span>observing, “In times of mourning the Jews put on sackcloth, or coarse and sordid raiment; and spread dust and ashes on their heads: on the contrary, splendid clothing, and ointment poured on the head, were the signs of joy.” <span class="ital">The oil of joy </span>— Which makes the face to shine, instead of that mourning which disfigures the countenance, and makes it unlovely.

The poor are commonly best disposed to receive the gospel, Jas 2:5; and it is only likely to profit us when received with meekness. To such as are poor in spirit, Christ preached good tidings when he said, Blessed are the meek. Christ's satisfaction is accepted. By the dominion of sin in us, we are bound under the power of Satan; but the Son is ready, by his Spirit, to make us free; and then we shall be free indeed. Sin and Satan were to be destroyed; and Christ triumphed over them on his cross. But the children of men, who stand out against these offers, shall be dealt with as enemies. Christ was to be a Comforter, and so he is; he is sent to comfort all who mourn, and who seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. He will do all this for his people, that they may abound in the fruits of righteousness, as the branches of God's planting. Neither the mercy of God, the atonement of Christ, nor the gospel of grace, profit the self-sufficient and proud. They must be humbled, and led to know their own character and wants, by the Holy Spirit, that they may see and feel their need of the sinner's Friend and Saviour. His doctrine contains glad tidings indeed to those who are humbled before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord - (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). There is probably an allusion here to the year of Jubilee, when the trumpet was blown, and liberty was proclaimed throughout all the land (so <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9-10</a>). In like manner the Messiah would come to proclaim universal liberty - liberty to all the world from the degrading servitude of sin. The time of his coming would be a time when Yahweh would be pleased to proclaim through him universal emancipation from this ignoble bondage, and to restore to all the privilege of being the freedmen of the Lord.<p>And the day of vengeance of our God - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>). This is language adapted to the deliverance from Babylon. The rescue of his people would be attended with vengeance on their enemies. This was not quoted by the Saviour in his discourse at Nazareth, or if quoted, the fact is not recorded by Luke (see <a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>). The text which the Saviour took then as the foundation of his discourse <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>, seems to have ended with the clause before this, It is not to be inferred, however, that he did not consider the subsequent expressions as referring to himself, but it was not necessary to his purpose to quote them. Regarded as applicable to the Redeemer and his preaching, this doubtless refers to the fact that his coming would be attended with vengeance on his foes. It is a great truth, manifest everywhere, that God's coming forth at any time to deliver his people is attended with vengeance on his enemies. So it was in the destruction of Idumea - regarded as the general representative of all the foes of God (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1-10</a>); so it was in the deliverance from Egypt - involving the destruction of Pharaoh and his host; so in the destruction of Babylon and the deliverance of the captives there. So in like manner it was in the destruction of Jerusalem; and so it will be at the end of the world <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-10</a>.<p>To comfort all that mourn - The expression, 'all that mourn,' may refer either to those who mourn over the loss of earthly friends and possessions, or to those who mourn over sin.

Not an exact year, but time in general; for such are wrong, who from hence conclude that Christ's public ministry lasted but a year, since it is certain, by the passovers he kept, that it must be at least three or four years; the whole time of Christ on earth was an acceptable and desirable time, what many great personages desired to see, and did not: this time may take in the whole Gospel dispensation, which was ushered in by Christ: the allusion, as before observed, is to the year of jubilee, when there was a proclamation of liberty; of release of debts; of restoration of inheritances, and of cessation from work; all which must make it an acceptable year: and this proclamation was made on the day of atonement; and Jarchi interprets the phrase here of a "year of reconciliation"; or "the year of atonement to the Lord", as it maybe rendered (s); this was made by the sacrifice of Christ, and is proclaimed in the Gospel, and makes a most considerable part of it. It may be rendered, "the year of the good will of the Lord" (t); and such was the time of Christ's coming on earth, to save men, and make peace and reconciliation for them, <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a> and was an "acceptable time" indeed; acceptable to the Lord himself; as were the incarnation of Christ, his obedience and righteousness, his sufferings and death, his sacrifice and satisfaction; since hereby the perfections of God were glorified, his purposes fulfilled, his covenant confirmed, and his people saved: acceptable to men; as were the birth of Christ; the things done by him; peace made, pardon procured, righteousness brought in, and salvation wrought out; all which must be acceptable to such who are lost, and know it, and are sensible that nothing of their own can save them; see <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>. <p>the day of vengeance of our God; when vengeance was taken on sin, in the person of Christ; when he destroyed the works of the devil, the devil himself, and spoiled principalities and powers; when he abolished death, and was the plague and destruction of that and the grave; when he brought wrath to the uttermost on the Jews for the rejection of him, who would not have him to reign over them; and who will take vengeance on antichrist at his spiritual coming, and upon all the wicked at the day of judgment.

An "acceptable year," or "year of acceptance," is a space of time during which God would be pleased to accept such as repented and turned to him. It is, of course, not intended to limit the space to a "year." The space is rather the term of our sojourn here below. <span class="cmt_word">The day of</span> <span class="cmt_word">vengeance.</span> The "day" of vengeance is contrasted with the "year" of acceptance, to indicate God's long-suffering and patience towards sinners (comp. <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>; and see also <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To comfort all that mourn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who "sorrow after a godly sort" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>) - all who mourn their transgressions and shortcomings, their "sins, negligences, and ignorances," with a hearty desire to be rid of them, and to serve God truly in the future. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The outward and inward beauty of the new Jerusalem is now depicted by the materials of her structure, and the powers which prevail within her. "For copper I bring gold, and for iron I bring silver, and for wood copper, and for stones iron, and make peace thy magistracy, and righteousness thy bailiffs. Injustice is no more seen in thy land, wasting and destruction in thy borders; and thou callest salvation thy walls, and renown thy gates." Wood and stone are not used at all in the building of the new Jerusalem. Just as in the time of Solomon silver was counted as nothing (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>) and had only the value of stones (<a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>), so here Jehovah gives her gold instead of copper, silver instead of iron; whilst copper and iron are so despised with this superabundance of the precious metals, that they take the place of such building materials as wood and stones. Thus the city will be a massive one, and not even all of stone, but entirely built of metal, and indestructible not only by the elements, but by all kinds of foes. The allegorical continuation of the prophecy shows very clearly that the prophet does not mean his words to be taken literally. The lxx, Saad., and others, are wrong in adopting the rendering, "I make thy magistracy peace," etc.; since sha&#770;lo&#772;m and tseda&#770;qa&#770;h are not accusatives of either the predicate or the object, but such personifications as we are accustomed to in Isaiah (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>; cf., <a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). Jehovah makes peace its pequdda&#770;h, i.e., its "overseership" (like gebhu&#772;ra&#770;h, heroship, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>, and &#8219;ezra&#770;h, helpership, in <a href="/isaiah/31-2.htm">Isaiah 31:2</a>), or magistracy; and righteousness its bailiffs. The plural &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; is no disproof of the personification; the meaning is, that tseda&#770;qa&#770;h (righteousness) is to Jerusalem what the whole body of civil officers together are: that is to say, righteousness is a substitute for the police force in every form. Under such magistracy and such police, nothing is ever heard within the land, of which Jerusalem is the capital, of either cha&#770;ma&#770;s, i.e., a rude and unjust attack of the stronger upon the weaker, or of sho&#772;d, i.e., conquest and devastation, and shebher, i.e., dashing to pieces, or breaking in two. It has walls (<a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>); but in truth "salvation," the salvation of its God, is regarded as its impregnable fortifications. It has gates (<a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>) but tehilla&#770;h, the renown that commands respect, with which Jehovah has invested it, is really better than any gate, whether for ornament or protection. </body></html>
