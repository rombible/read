In like manner, vice and wickedness are sometimes represented as so closely adhering to a man as to be a part of his very clothing; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18-19</a> :<p>He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a garment.<p>Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him,<p>And for a girdle, wherewith he is girded continually.<p>The Chaldee renders this, 'And the just shall be round about him on every side - &#1505;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; &#1505;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; seho&#770;r seho&#770;r - and the servants of truth shall come near to him.' The idea is, that he shall be distinguished for justice and truth, and that a zeal for these shall make him strong and active in executing the purposes of his reign. This closes the description of the "personal" qualities of the Messiah. The account of the effects of his reign follows in the subsequent verses. <p><a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>I wilt greatly rejoice in the Lord - This is the language of the prophet in the name of the church; or, as Vitringa supposes, the language of a chorus introduced here by the prophet. The Chaldee regards it as the language of Jerusalem, and renders it, 'Jerusalem said, I will surely rejoice in the Lord.' The sentiment is, that the prosperity and enlargement of Zion is an occasion of joy, and should lead to thanksgiving and praise. The phrase, 'I will rejoice in the Lord,' means that the joy would arise from the view of the faithfulness and perfections of Yahweh manifested in the redemption of his people.

These are not the words of the prophet spoken in his own person, rejoicing in the goodness of the Lord to his people and countrymen; nor of Christ; but of the church, especially the Jewish church, expressing her joy for benefits received, as declared in the preceding verses. The Targum is, <p>"Jerusalem said, rejoicing I will rejoice in the Word of the Lord;'' <p>not in his word of promise, but in his essential Word, his Son the Messiah; in his person, offices, fulness, righteousness, and salvation: <p>my soul shall be joyful in my God; in Christ, in that he is God, and so able to save to the uttermost, and keep from a final and total falling, and to preserve safe to his kingdom and glory: hence his person is excellent; his blood precious; his righteousness valuable; and his sacrifice efficacious; and all matter of joy to the believer: and who also rejoices in that he is his God, "my God"; God in our nature; Immanuel, God with us; the God-man and Mediator, through whom there is access to God and acceptance with him; and who stands in near relation to his people, and has all fullness to supply their wants, and makes all he has theirs; so that, they have great reason to rejoice in him indeed. The Targum is, <p>"my soul shall rejoice in the salvation of my God;'' <p>the nature of this joy may be collected from the text itself: it is not a carnal one, or the joy of a carnal man in carnal things, it is spiritual; nor a pharisaical joy, a rejoicing in a man's self, in his own works of righteousness, for this "is in the Lord"; nor is it a hypocritical one, or only externally, for it is the soul that rejoices; and it is the joy of faith, or in the Lord, as "my God"; and a very great one it is, joy unspeakable, and full of glory; and is what continues, as the matter and ground of it always does, as follows: "for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation"; with salvation as garments; the salvation of Christ, which, like garments, is without men, being wrought out by Christ; and is brought near, and applied by the spirit of Christ; and is all around, and encompasses the saints as such, and like them beautifies and adorns them, and keeps them warm and comfortable, when they have the joys of it; and which secures them from the storms of divine wrath and vengeance; and the plural number being used may denote the fulness and completeness of this salvation, from all sin, from wrath, hell, and damnation, and from every enemy: and this is matter of joy to the believer interested in it, and clothed with it; since it is a salvation so great; a garment so fitting and suitable, and had at free cost; and in which the glory of all the divine perfections is so conspicuous, as well as it being so full, complete, and perfect, and an everlasting one: <p>he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness: not with her own, that is a rag, and not a robe, and a filthy one too, <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a> and no covering, and is indeed no righteousness, properly speaking; but the righteousness of Christ, the best robe, the wedding garment, and change of raiment, which, like a robe, is upon believers, but not in them; it in Christ, and imputed to them; it covers their persons and their nakedness, and all their sins, so as not to be seen with the eye of avenging justice: to clothe and cover with it is God's act of imputation, and Christ's application of it by his Spirit, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>, which, perceived by the believer, causes great joy; it being all of a piece, like Christ's seamless robe, and so pure and spotless, so perfect and complete, and so rich and glorious: <p>as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments; or, "adorns" himself <p>in a princely or priestly manner (d); for the word used signifies both. The sense is, as a bridegroom puts on the best clothes he has on his wedding day, and makes the appearance of a prince in his richest robes, or as the high priest when he had on all his sacerdotal garments; so the Targum, <p>"as a bridegroom that flourishes in his bridechamber, and as the high priest who is adorned with his garments:'' <p>and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels; or "implements" (e); and makes herself as fine as she can, to recommend herself to her spouse and her friends: thus richly and magnificently arrayed is the church of Christ, and every believer, being clothed with his righteousness; he and they are in the same relation; he is the bridegroom, they the bride; and they are clothed alike with the garment down to the foot; and are righteous as he is righteous; and are herewith as a bride adorned and made ready for her husband; and the joy at such a solemnity fitly expresses the mutual joy of Christ and his church; see <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> so Christ's righteousness is compared to a wedding garment, <a href="/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>. <p>(d) "sacerdotali more ornabit", Tigurine version; "qui sacerdotem refert ornatu", Piscator.

According to the Targum and some critics the speaker here is the Zion of the future; while Delitzsch and others, who assign the preceding words to the Servant of Jehovah, suppose that he is still the speaker.

God clothes Israel with "righteousness" derived from himself (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>), and then with its natural consequence - "salvation." The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/61.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Even in <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a> with &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; a perfect was introduced in the place of the infinitives of the object, and affirmed what was to be accomplished through the mediation of the Servant of Jehovah. The second turn in the address, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4-9</a>, continues the use of such perfects, which afterwards pass into futures. But the whole is still governed by the commencement in <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The Servant of Jehovah celebrates the glorious office committed to him, and expounds the substance of the gospel given him to proclaim. It points to the restoration of the promised land, and to the elevation of Israel, after its purification in the furnace of judgment, to great honour and dignity in the midst of the world of nations. "And they will build up wastes of the olden time, raise up desolations of the forefathers, and renew desolate cities, desolations of former generations. And strangers stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners become your ploughmen and vinedressers. But ye will be called priests of Jehovah; Servants of our God, will men say to you: ye will eat the riches of the nations, and pride yourselves in their glory." The desolations and wastes of &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m and do&#772;r va&#770;do&#772;r, i.e., of ages remote and near (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>), are not confined to what had lain in ruins during the seventy years of the captivity. The land will be so thickly populated, that the former places of abode will not suffice (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-20</a>); so that places must be referred to which are lying waste beyond the present bounds of the promised land (<a href="/isaiah/54-3.htm">Isaiah 54:3</a>), and which will be rebuilt, raised up, and renewed by those who return from exile, and indeed by the latest generations (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>, &#1502;&#1501;&#1468;; cf., <a href="/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>). Cho&#772;rebh, in the sense of desolation, is a word belonging to the alter period of the language (Zeph., Jer., and Ezek.). The rebuilding naturally suggests the thought of assistance on the part of the heathen (<a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>). But the prophet expresses the fact that they will enter into the service of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5</a>), in a new and different form. They "stand there" (viz., at their posts ready for service, &#8219;al-mish-marta&#770;m, <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>), "and feed your flocks" (&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; singularetantum, cf., <a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>), and foreigners are your ploughmen and vinedressers. Israel is now, in the midst of the heathen who have entered into the congregation of Jehovah and become the people of God (ch <a href="/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>), what the Aaronites formerly were in the midst of Israel itself. It stands upon the height of its primary destination to be a kingdom of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). They are called "priests of Jehovah," and the heathen call them "servants of our God;" for even the heathen speak with believing reverence of the God, to whom Israel renders priestly service, as "our God." This reads as if the restored Israelites were to stand in the same relation to the converted heathen as the clergy to the laity; but it is evident, from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a>, that the prophet has no such hierarchical separation as this in his mind. All that we can safely infer from his prophecy is, that the nationality of Israel will not be swallowed up by the entrance of the heathen into the community of the God of revelation. The people created by Jehovah, to serve as the vehicle of the promise of salvation and the instrument in preparing the way for salvation, will also render Him special service, even after that salvation has been really effected. At the same time, we cannot take the attitude, which is here assigned to the people of sacred history after it has become the teacher of the nations, viz., as the leader of its worship also, and shape it into any clear and definite form that shall be reconcilable with the New Testament spirit of liberty and the abolition of all national party-walls. The Old Testament prophet utters New Testament prophecies in an Old Testament form. Even when he continues to say, "Ye will eat the riches of the Gentiles, and pride yourselves in their glory," i.e., be proud of the glorious things which have passed from their possession into yours, this is merely colouring intended to strike the eye, which admits of explanation on the ground that he saw the future in the mirror of the present, as a complete inversion of the relation in which the two had stood before. The figures present themselves to him in the form of contrasts. The New Testament apostle, on the other hand, says in <a href="/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a> that the conversion of all Israel to Christ will be "the riches of the Gentiles." But if even then the Gentile church should act according to the words of the same apostle in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>, and show her gratitude to the people whose spiritual debtor she is, by ministering to them in carnal things, all that the prophet has promised here will be amply fulfilled. We cannot adopt the explanation proposed by Hitzig, Stier, etc., "and changing with them, ye enter into their glory" (hithyamme&#772;r from ya&#770;mar  equals  mu&#772;r, Hiph.: he&#772;m&#305;&#772;r, <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; lit., to exchange with one another, to enter into one another's places); for ya&#770;mar  equals  &#8219;a&#770;mar (cf., ya&#770;chad  equals  'a&#770;chad; ya&#770;sham  equals  'a&#770;sham; ya&#770;laph  equals  'a&#770;laph), to press upwards, to rise up (related to ta&#770;mar, see at <a href="/isaiah/17-9.htm">Isaiah 17:9</a>; sa&#770;mar, Symm. &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, possibly also &#8219;a&#770;mar with the hithpael hith&#8219;amme&#772;r, lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), yields a much simpler and more appropriate meaning. From this verb we have hith'amme&#772;r in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, "to lift one's self up (proudly)," and here hithyamme&#772;r; and it is in this way that the word has been explained by Jerome (superbietis), and possibly by the lxx (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;, in the sense of spectabiles eritis), by the Targum, and the Syriac, as well as by most of the ancient and modern expositors. </body></html>
