The meaning of this prediction seems to be, that though the first Christians should have a large share of shame or ignominy thrown upon them, yet their descendants should, in return, receive a double share of honour and glory. This accordingly came to pass: Christianity, from being considered as the greatest infamy, and being loaded with the greatest shame, came into the highest repute when Constantine became emperor, and received the highest honours that could possibly be paid, and was, as it were, loaded with glory, riches, and honour.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>61:4-9 Promises are here made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual thraldom. An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, through the Spirit. When, by the grace of God, we attain to holy indifference as to the affairs of this world; when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts are not entangled with them, but preserved entire for God and his service, then the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and vine-dressers. Those whom He sets at liberty, he sets to work. His service is perfect freedom; it is the greatest honour. All believers are made, to our God, kings and priests; and always ought to conduct themselves as such. Those who have the Lord for their portion, have reason to say, that they have worthy portion, and to rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we shall receive more than double for all our services and sufferings. God desires truth, and therefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify any man's robbery to say, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery is most hateful which is under this pretence. Let the children of godly parents be such, that all may see the fruits of a good education; an answer to the prayers for them, in the fruit of God's blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye shall be named - The idea here literally is, 'There will be no need of your engaging in the business of agriculture. All that will be done by others; and you, as ministers of God, may engage wholly in the duties of religion. The world shall be tributary to you, and you shall enjoy the productions of all lands; and you may, therefore, devote yourselves exclusively to the service of Yahweh, as a kingdom of priests.' A similar promise occurs in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a> : 'And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.' The idea is, that there would be a degree of spiritual prosperity, as great as if they were permitted to enjoy all the productions of other climes; as if all menial and laborious service were performed by others; and as if they were to be entirely free from the necessity of toil, and were permitted to devote themselves exclusively to the services of religion.<p>Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles - (See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-11</a>).<p>And in their glory - In what constitutes their glory, or what they regard as valuable; that is, their wealth, their talents, and their power.<p>Shall you boast yourselves? - There has been considerable variety of interpretation in regard to the meaning of the word used here. Jerome renders it, Et in gloria earum superbietis. The Septuagint, 'In their wealth ye shall be admired' (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;  thaumasthe&#772;sesthe). The Chaldee and Syriac render it, 'In their splendor ye shall glory.' The word used is &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;  ya&#770;mar. It occurs nowhere else, it is believed, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>, twice, where it is tendered 'changed.' 'Hath a nation changed (&#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;  hahe&#772;ymiyr) their gods, which are yet no gods? But my people have changed (        &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;  he&#772;miyr) their glory for that which doth not profit.' In the passage before us, it is used in Hithpael, and means properly to exchange oneself with anyone. Here it means, 'In their splendor we shall take their places,' that is, we shall enjoy it in their stead. We shall avail ourselves of it as if we were to enter into their possessions, and as if it were our own. The sense is, it shall come to enrich and adorn the church. It shall cleavage places, and shall all belong to the penple of God - in accordance with that which has been so often said by Isaiah, that the wealth of the world would become tributary to the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

"The smallest one will become thousands, and the meanest one a powerful nation." "The small and mean one," or, as the idea is a relative one, "the smallest and meanest one" (Ges. 119, 2), is either a childless one, or one blessed with very few children. At the same time, the reference is not exclusively to growth through the blessing of children, but also to growth through the extension of fellowship. We have a similar expression in <a href="/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), where 'eleph is employed, just as it is here, in the sense of &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, "to thousands (or chiliads)." <p>The whole of the prophetic address is now sealed with this declaration: "I Jehovah, will hasten it in His time." The neuter &#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (as in <a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>) refers to everything that has been predicted from <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a> downwards. Jehovah will fulfil it rapidly, when the point of time (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) which He has fixed for it shall have arrived. As this point of time is known to Him only, the predicted glory will burst all at once with startling suddenness upon the eyes of those who have waited believingly for Him. <p>This chapter forms a connected and self-contained whole, as we may see very clearly from the address to Zion-Jerusalem, which is sustained throughout. If we compare together such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17-23</a> ("Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem"), <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1-2</a> ("Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion"), and chapter 54 ("Sing, O barren"), which are all closely related so far as their contents are concerned, we shall find that these addresses to Zion form an ascending series, chapter 60 being the summit to which they rise, and that the whole is a complete counterpart to the address to the daughter of Babylon in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-15</a>. </body></html>
