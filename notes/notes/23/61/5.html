The implied thought of the whole passage is, as in the next verse, that all Israel is raised to the dignity of a priestly caste, leaving the rough work of the world to be done by foreigners, who stood on a lower level.

An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, through the Spirit. When, by the grace of God, we attain to holy indifference as to the affairs of this world; when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts are not entangled with them, but preserved entire for God and his service, then the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and vine-dressers. Those whom He sets at liberty, he sets to work. His service is perfect freedom; it is the greatest honour. All believers are made, to our God, kings and priests; and always ought to conduct themselves as such. Those who have the Lord for their portion, have reason to say, that they have worthy portion, and to rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we shall receive more than double for all our services and sufferings. God desires truth, and therefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify any man's robbery to say, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery is most hateful which is under this pretence. Let the children of godly parents be such, that all may see the fruits of a good education; an answer to the prayers for them, in the fruit of God's blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And strangers shall stand - (See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>).<p>And feed your flocks - The keeping of flocks constituted a very considerable part of the husbandry of those who dwelt in Palestine. Of course, any considerable prosperity of a spiritual nature would be well represented by an accession of foreigners, who should come to relieve them in their toil. It is not necessary to suppose that this is to be taken literally, nor that it should be so spiritualized as to suppose that the prophet refers to churches and their pastors, and to the fact, that those churches would be put under the care of pastors from among the pagan. The idea is, that it would be a time of signal spiritual prosperity, and when the accession would be as great and important as if foreigners were to come in among a people, and take the whole labor of attending their flocks and cultivating their fields.<p>Your plowmen - Hebrew, &#1488;&#1499;&#1512;  'ikka&#770;r, from which probably is derived the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  agros; the Gothic akr; the German acker; and the English acre.

And whereas the church of God is compared to a vineyard, and particular churches of Christ to vines; such men as are called by grace from among the Gentiles, and have received gifts from Christ, shall be the keepers and dressers of these vines, plant, and prune, and water them, and do everything requisite unto them; see Sol 2:15. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/61.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And foreigners shall <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <i>shall be</i> your plowmen and your vinedressers.</span><p>(i) They will be ready to serve you in all your needs.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/61.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the sons of the alien</span>] Render with R.V. <span class="bld">aliens</span> (as ch. <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5, 6</span>. Israel’s priesthood among the nations, and the services rendered to it by the latter.

The fundamental idea of priesthood in the O.T. being the right of approach to God, this idea is conceived as realised in a system which may be likened to a series of concentric circles,—priests, Levites, ordinary Israelites, Gentiles,—each grade standing nearer to God than the next. It was Israel’s calling to be a “kingdom of priests” (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>), and in the latter days this destiny will be fulfilled in their mediatorial relation to the outer world. Although prophecy in general accords a position of supremacy to Israelites in the future kingdom of God, the distinction is perhaps nowhere so definitely formulated as here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1, 2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>). The Gentiles who join themselves with the Jews, and form with them one community, are constantly represented in the writings of Isaiah as occupying a subordinate position. In the New Testament, Jew and Gentile are put upon a par. Is the explanation that Isaiah assumes that the Jews generally will accept the gospel, and therefore, to some extent, retain their privileges in the new community, whereas, in fact, they rejected the gospel, and so lost their natural position (see <a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7-20</a>)? Or does Isaiah look onward to a later date? And is there to be a restoration of "Israel according to the flesh" upon their conversion, and a reinstatement of them in a position of privilege?

The church of the new Jerusalem consists of none but righteous ones, who have been cleansed from guilt, and keep themselves henceforth pure from sinning, and therefore possess the land of promise for ever, without having to fear repeated destruction and banishment: a "sprout" (ne&#772;tser as in <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; Arab. nadr, the green branch) "of my plantations" (&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; chethib, erroneously &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493; or &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;), i.e., of my creative acts of grace (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>), a "work of my hands" (cf., <a href="/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>), "to glorify me," i.e., in which I possess that in which I glory (&#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; as in <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>). </body></html>
