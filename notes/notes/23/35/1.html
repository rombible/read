We have more than once had occasion to observe, that by <span class="ital">the wilderness </span>is generally meant the Gentile world: now, it is here foretold, that, through the influence of the gospel and the grace of God, it should put on a new face, and become like a pleasant and fruitful garden; that multitudes of converts to the true religion should be made therein, and a vast number of spiritual and holy worshippers should be raised up to God in it. Some, indeed, would interpret this chapter as referring merely to the flourishing state of Hezekiah’s kingdom in the latter part of his reign, or to the cultivation of Judea again after the return of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon. But, as Bishop Lowth observes, that it has a view beyond any such events as these, “is plain from every part, especially from the middle of it, where the miraculous works wrought by our blessed Saviour are so clearly specified that we cannot avoid making the application. And our Saviour himself has, moreover, plainly referred to this very passage, as speaking of him and his works, <a href="/context/matthew/11-4.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again those things which you do hear and see:...">Matthew 11:4-5</a>. He bids the disciples of John to go and report to their Master the things which they heard and saw; that the blind receive their sight, &c., and leaves it to him to draw the conclusion in answer to his inquiry, whether he, who performed the very works which the prophets foretold should be performed by the Messiah, was not indeed the Messiah himself. And where are these works so distinctly marked by any of the prophets as in this place? And how could they be marked more distinctly? To these the strictly literal interpretation of the prophet’s words directs us. According to the allegorical interpretation, they may have a further view; and this part of the prophecy may run parallel with the former, and relate to the future advent of Christ; to the conversion of the Jews, and their restitution to their land; to the extension and purification of the Christian faith, events predicted in Scripture as preparatory to it.” We may conclude, therefore, with certainty, that as the slaughters and desolations foretold in the former chapter look far beyond the calamities brought on Idumea and the neighbouring nations, by the Assyrians or Chaldeans; so does the bright and pleasant picture of the prosperity and happiness of God’s people, drawn in this chapter, look far beyond any felicity experienced by the Jews, either in any part of Hezekiah’s reign, or after the return from Babylon. It is undoubtedly the flourishing state of the kingdom of Christ, or of the gospel church, composed of Jews and Gentiles, which is here predicted, and especially as it shall exist in the latter days, after the destruction of all the anti-christian powers, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and all Israel shall be saved.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-4 Judea was prosperous in the days of Hezekiah, but the kingdom of Christ is the great subject intended. Converting grace makes the soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and to blossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. This is the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and he that says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who is mighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to take vengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundant comforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will come again at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people; and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full reward for all their troubles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wilderness and the solitary place - This is evidently figurative language, such as is often employed by the prophets. The word rendered 'solitary place' (&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;  ts&#305;&#770;ya&#770;h), denotes properly a dry place, a place without springs and streams of water; and as such places produce no verdure, and nothing to sustain life, the word comes to mean a desert. Such expressions are often used in the Scriptures to express moral or spiritual desolation; and in this sense evidently the phrase is used here. It does not refer to the desolations of Judea, but to all places that might be properly called a moral wilderness, or a spiritual desert; and thus aptly expresses the condition of the world that was to be benefited by the blessings foretold in this chapter. The parallel expressions in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3-4</a>, show that this is the sense in which the phrase is here used; and that the meaning is, that every situation which might be appropriately called a moral wilderness - that is, the whole pagan world - would ultimately be made glad. The sense is, that as great and happy changes would take place in regard to those desolations as if the wilderness should become a vast field producing the lily and the rose; or as if <a href="/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a> there should be imparted to such places the glory of Lebanon, and the beauty of Sharon and Carmel.<p>Shall be glad for them - This is evidently a personification, a beautiful poetic figure, by which the wilderness is represented as expressing joy. The sense is, the desolate moral world would be filled with joy on account of the blessings which are here predicted. The phrase 'for them,' expressed in Hebrew by the affix &#1502;  (m) means, doubtless, on account of the blessings which are foretold in this prophecy. Lowth supposes, however, that the letter has been added to the word 'shall be glad' (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;  yes'us'u&#770;), by mistake, because the following word (&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  midba&#770;r) begins with a &#1502;  (m). The reading of the present Hebrew text is followed by none of the ancient versions; but it is nevertheless probably the correct reading, and there is no authority for changing it. The sense is expressed above by the phrase 'shall rejoice on account of the things contained in this prophecy;' to wit, the destruction of all the foes of God, and the universal establishment of his kingdom. Those who wish to see a more critical examination of the words used here, may find it in Rosenmuller and Gesenius.<p>And blossom as the rose - The word rendered 'rose' (&#1495;&#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;  cha&#774;b&#305;&#770;tsa&#770;leth) occurs only here and in Sol 2:1, where it is also rendered a 'rose.' The Septuagint renders it, &#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Krinon 'Lily.' The Vulgate also renders it, Lilium - the lily. The Syriac renders it also by a word which signifies the lily or narcissus; or, according to the Syriac lexicographers, 'the meadow-saffron,' an autumnal flower springing from poisonous bulbous roots, and of a white and violet color. The sense is not, however, affected materially whatever be the meaning of the word. Either the rose, the lily, or the saffron, would convey the idea of beauty compared with the solitude and desolation of the desert. The word 'rose' with us, as being a flower better known, conveys a more striking image of beauty, and there is no impropriety in retaining it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 35<p>Isa 35:1-10.

"And pelican and hedgehog take possession of it, and eared-owl and raven dwell there; and he stretches over it the measure of Tohu and the level of Bohu. Its nobles - there is no longer a monarchy which they elected; and all its princes come to nought." The description of the ruin, which commences in <a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> with a list of animals that frequent marshy and solitary regions, is similar to the one in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, which is founded upon this). Isaiah's was the original of all such pictures of ruin which we meet with in the later prophets. The qippo&#772;d is the hedgehog, although we find it here in the company of birds (from qa&#770;phad, to draw one's self together, to roll up; see <a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>). &#1511;&#1488;&#1514; is written here with a double kametz, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, according to codd. and Kimchi, W.B. (Targ. qa&#770;th, elsewhere qa&#770;q; Saad. and Abulwalid, qu&#770;q: see at <a href="/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>). According to well-established tradition, it is the long-necked pelican, which lives upon fish (the name is derived either from &#1511;&#1493;&#1488;, to vomit, or, as the construct is &#1511;&#1488;&#1514;, from a word &#1511;&#1488;&#1492;, formed in imitation of the animal's cry). Yanshu&#772;ph is rendered by the Targum q&#305;&#772;ppo&#772;ph&#305;&#772;n (Syr. kafu&#770;fo), i.e., eared-owls, which are frequently mentioned in the Talmud as birds of ill omen (Rashi, or Berachoth 57b, chouette). As the parallel to qa&#770;v, we have &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (stones) here instead of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;, the level, in <a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>. It is used in the same sense, however - namely, to signify the weight used in the plumb or level, which is suspended by a line. The level and the measure are commonly employed for the purpose of building up; but here Jehovah is represented as using these fore the purpose of pulling down (a figure met with even before the time of Isaiah: vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7-9</a>, cf., <a href="/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-8.htm">Lamentations 2:8</a>), inasmuch as He carries out this negative reverse of building with the same rigorous exactness as that with which a builder carries out his well-considered plan, and throws Edom back into a state of desolation and desert, resembling the disordered and shapeless chaos of creation (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>, where to&#772;hu&#772; va&#770;bho&#772;hu&#772; represents, as it does here, the state into which a land is reduced by fire). &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; has no dagesh lene; and this is one of the three passages in which the opening mute is without a dagesh, although the word not only follows, but is closely connected with, one which has a soft consonant as its final letter (the others are <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>). Thus the primeval kingdom with its early monarchy, which is long preceded that of Israel, is brought to an end (<a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>). &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; stands at the head as a kind of protasis. Edom was an elective monarchy; the hereditary nobility electing the new king. But this would be done no more. The electoral princes of Edom would come to nothing. Not a trace would be left of all that had built up the glory of Edom. </body></html>
