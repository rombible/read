The dreary wilderness stretches before us, monotonous, treeless, in some parts bearing a scanty vegetation which flourishes in early spring and dies before fierce summer heats, but for the most part utterly desolate, the sand blinding the eyes, the ground cracked and gaping as if athirst for the rain that will not fall; over it the tantalising mirage dancing in mockery, and amid the hot sand the yelp of the jackals. What does this dead land want? One thing alone-water. Could that be poured upon it, all would be changed; nothing else will do any good. And it comes. Suddenly it bursts from the sand, and streams bring life along the desert. It gathers into placid lakes, with their whispering reeds and nodding rushes, and the thick cool grass round their margins. The foul beasts that wandered through dry places seeking rest are drowned out. So full of blessed change will be the coming of the Lord, of which all this context speaks. Mark that this burst of waters is when ‘the Lord shall come,’ and that it is the reason for the restoration of lost powers in men, and especially for a chorus of praise from dumb lips. This, then, is the central blessing. It is not merely a joyful transformation, but it is the reason for a yet more joyful transformation {<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>}. Recall Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman and in the Temple on the great day of the Feast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then this is pre-eminently a description of the work of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Christ brings the Supernatural Communication of a New Life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We may fairly regard this metaphor as setting forth the very deepest characteristic of the gospel. Consider man’s need, as typified in the image of the desert. Mark that the supply for that need must come from without; that coming from without, it must be lodged in the heart of the race; that the supernatural communication of a new life and power is the very essence of the work of Christ; that such a communication is the only thing adequate to produce these wondrous effects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. This new life slakes men’s thirst.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The pangs and tortures of the waterless wilderness. The thirst of human souls; they long, whether they know it or not, for-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Truth for Understanding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Love for Heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Basis and Guidance for Will and Effort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cleansing for Conscience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Adequate objects for their powers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>They need that all these should be in One.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The gnawing pain of our thirst is not a myth; it is the secret of man’s restlessness. We are ever on the march, not only because change is the law of the world, nor only because effort and progress are the law for civilised men, but because, like caravans in the desert, we have to search for water.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In Christ it is slaked; all is found there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The Communication of this New Life turns Illusions into Realities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘The mirage shall become a pool.’ Life without Christ is but a long illusion. ‘Sin makes a mock of fools.’ How seldom are hopes fulfilled, and how still less frequently are they, when fulfilled, as good as we painted them! The prismatic splendours of the rain bow, which gleam before us and which we toil to catch, are but grey rain-drops when caught. Joys attract and, attained, have incompleteness and a tang of bitterness. The fish is never so heavy when landed on the sward as it felt when struggling on our hook. ‘All is vanity’-yes, if creatures and things temporal are pursued as our good. But nothing is vanity, if we have the life in us which Jesus comes to give. His Gospel gives solid, unmingled joys, sure promises which are greater when fulfilled than when longed for, certain hopes whose most brilliant colours are duller than those of the realities. The half has not been told of the ‘things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sure Promises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A certain Hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. This New Life gives Fruitfulness.</span> It stimulates all our nature. A godless life is in a very tragic sense barren, and a wilderness. There is in it nothing really worth doing, nor anything that will last. Christ gives Power, Motive, Pattern, and makes a life of holy activity possible. The works done by men apart from Him are, if measured by the whole relations and capacities of the doers, unfruitful works, however they may seem laden with ruddy clusters. It is only lives into which that river of God which is full of water flows that bring forth fruit, and whose fruit remains. The desert irrigated becomes a garden of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, too, how this river drowns out wild beasts. The true way of conquering evil is to turn the river into it. Cultivate, and weeds die. The expulsive power of a new affection is the most potent instrument for perfecting character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What is the use of water if we do not drink? We may perish with thirst even on the river’s bank. ‘If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:5-10 When Christ shall come to set up his kingdom in the world, then wonders, great wonders, shall be wrought on men's souls. By the word and Spirit of Christ, the spiritually blind were enlightened; and those deaf to the calls of God were made to hear them readily. Those unable to do any thing good, by Divine grace were made active therein. Those that knew not how to speak of God or to God, had their lips opened to show forth his praise. When the Holy Ghost came upon the Gentiles that heard the word, then were the fountains of life opened. Most of the earth is still a desert; neither means of grace, spiritual worshippers, nor fruits of holiness, are to be found in it. But the way of religion and godliness shall be laid open. The way of holiness is the way of God's commandment; it is the good old way. And the way to heaven is a plain way. Those knowing but little, and unlearned, shall be kept from missing the road. It shall be a safe way; nothing can do them any real hurt. Christ, the way to God, shall be clearly made known; and the way of a believer's duty shall be plainly marked out. Let us then go forward cheerfully, assured that the end of this way shall be everlasting joy, and rest for the soul. Those who by faith are made citizens of the gospel Zion, rejoice in Christ Jesus; and their sorrows and sighs are made to flee away by Divine consolations. Thus these prophecies conclude. Our joyful hopes and prospects of eternal life should swallow up all the sorrows and all the joys of this present time. But of what avail is it to admire the excellence of God's word, unless we can call its precious promises our own? Do we love God, not only as our Creator, but because he gave his only Son to die for us? And are we walking in the ways of holiness? Let us try ourselves by such plain questions, rather than spend time on things that may be curious and amusing, but are unprofitable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shall the lame man leap - This was literally fulfilled after the coming of the Messiah <a href="/acts/14-10.htm">Acts 14:10</a>; <a href="/acts/3-8.htm">Acts 3:8</a>.

The world, in regard to its real comforts without the gospel, may be not unaptly compared to g vast waste of pathless sands and arid plains. Nothing will more strongly express the blessings of the gospel than the idea of cool, refreshing, abundant fountains and streams bursting forth in such pathless wastes. This is an image which would be very expressive to those who were accustomed to cross such deserts, and it is one which is frequently employed by the sacred writers, and especially by Isaiah (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19-20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>). 'Lameness and dumbness are the uniform effects of long walking in a desert; the sand and gravel produce the former, fatigue the latter. In such cases some of us have walked hours together without uttering a sentence; and all walked as if crippled, from the sand and gravel getting into the shoes; but the sight of water, especially if unexpected, unloosed every tongue, and gave agility to every limb; men, oxen, goats, sheep, and dogs, ran with speed and expressions of joy to the refreshing element.' (Campbell's Travels in Africa.) The Chaldee Paraphrast understands this as referring entirely to the return from the captivity at Babylon. 'Then shall they see the exiles of Israel assembled, ascend to their own land as the swift stags, so that they shall not be hindered.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. leap&#8212;literally, "fulfilled" (Ac 3:8; 14:10).<p>sing&#8212;joyful thanksgiving.<p>in &#8230; wilderness &#8230; waters&#8212;(Isa 41:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then shall the lame man leap</span> for joy, or go nimbly and readily.

Kimchi interprets all this of the Israelites, who were in captivity as blind, deaf, lame, and dumb. So the Targum of this and the preceding verse <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, <p>"then shall the eyes of the house of Israel be opened, who were as blind men as to the law; and the ears of them that are as deaf men, to attend to the words of the prophets shall hear; then when they shall see the captives of Israel gathered to go up to their own land as the swift harts, and not tarry,'' &amp;c.; <p>but it may be better applied to their present state, and to their case when they shall be turned to the Lord in the latter day: <p>for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert; not literally, but mystically; and may be understood both of the doctrines of the Gospel breaking out in the ministry of them, in such places as were like unto the wilderness and desert, quite barren, and destitute of the knowledge, grace, and fear of God; see <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> and of the abundance of grace, and the efficacy of it, making the word effectual to the conversion and fruitfulness of multitudes of souls, bringing along with it a vast variety of spiritual blessings; see <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a> to both which, the one as the means, and the other as the cause, all the above wonderful things are owing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then shall the lame <i>man</i> leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing: for in the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</span><p>(g) They who were barren and destitute of the graces of God, will have them given by Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in the wilderness shall waters break out</span>.

"Search in the book of Jehovah, and read! Not one of the creatures fails, not one misses the other: for my mouth - it has commanded it; and His breath - it has brought them together. And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has assigned it (this land) to them by measure: they will possess it for ever; to generation and generation they will dwell therein." The phrase &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; is used for entering in a book, inasmuch as what is written there is placed upon the page; and &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; for searching in a book, inasmuch as a person leans over the book when searching in it, and gets the object of his search out of it. The prophet applied the title "The Book of Jehovah" to his collection of the prophecies with which Jehovah had inspired him, and which He had commanded him to write down. Whoever lived to see the time when the judgment should come upon Edom, would have only to look inquiringly into this holy scripture; and if he compared what was predicted there with what had been actually realized, he would find the most exact agreement between them. The creatures named, which loved to frequent the marshes and solitary places, and ruins, would all really make their homes in what had once been Edom. But the satyrs and the l&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;th, which were only the offspring of the popular belief - what of them? They, too, would be there; for in the sense intended by the prophet they were actual devils, which he merely calls by well-known popular names to produce a spectral impression. Edom would really become a rendezvous for all the animals mentioned, as well as for such unearthly spirits as those which he refers to here. The prophet, or rather Jehovah, whose temporary organ he was, still further confirms this by saying, "My mouth hath commanded it, and His breath has brought them (all these creatures) together." As the first creating word proceeded from the mouth of Jehovah, so also does the word of prophecy, which resembles such a word; and the breath of the mouth of Jehovah, i.e., His Spirit, is the power which accomplishes the fiat of prophecy, as it did that of creation, and moulds all creatures and their history according to the will and counsel of God (<a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>). In the second part of <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a> the prophet is speaking of Jehovah; whereas in the first Jehovah speaks through him - a variation which vanishes indeed if we read &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (Olshausen on <a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>), or, what would be better, &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but which may be sustained by a hundred cases of a similar kind. There is a shadow, as it were, of this change in the &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, which alternates with &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; in connection with the animals named. The suffix of chilleqatta&#770;h (without mappik, as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>) refers to the land of Edom. Edom is, as it were, given up by a divine lot, and measured off with a divine measure, to be for ever the horrible abode of beasts and demons such as those described. A prelude of the fulfilment of this swept over the mountainous land of Edom immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem (see Khler on <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-5</a>); and it has never risen to its previous state of cultivation again. It swarms with snakes, and the desolate mountain heights and barren table-lands are only inhabited by wild crows and eagles, and great flocks of birds. But the ultimate fulfilment, to which the appeal in <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a> refers, is still in the future, and will eventually fall upon the abodes of those who spiritually belong to that circle of hostility to Jehovah (Jesus) and His church, of which ancient Edom was merely the centre fixed by the prophet.  </body></html>
