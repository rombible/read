If we suppose this to be spoken with any reference to the state of the Jews in Babylon, God avenged them when he overthrew the Babylonish empire, and brought them back to their own land. But, undoubtedly, the words are primarily intended of the coming of the Messiah in the flesh, and of the redemption and deliverance of God’s people through him; that is, of such as embraced Christianity, whom God signally avenged for all the malice and cruelty which the Jews had exercised upon them, when, by the Romans, he laid Jerusalem even with the ground, and cut off many hundreds of thousands of them by the sword, by famine, and other ways, for their obstinate rejection of the gospel, and crucifying of their Messiah.

Converting grace makes the soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and to blossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. This is the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and he that says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who is mighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to take vengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundant comforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will come again at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people; and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full reward for all their troubles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Strengthen ye - That is, you who are the religious teachers and guides of the people. This is an address made by the prophet in view of what he had said and was about to say of the proraised blessings. The sense is, strengthen and sustain the feeble and the desponding by the promised blessings; by the assurances <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a> that all the enemies of God and his people will be destroyed; and that he will manifest himself as their Protector, and send upon them the promised blessings. Or it may be regarded as addressed to the officers and ministers of religion when these blessings should have come; and as being an exhortation to them to make use of the influences, the promises, and the consolations which would attend the coming of the Messiah, to strengthen the feeble, and confirm those who were faint-hearted.<p>The weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees - Strength resides mainly in the arms, and in the lower limbs, or the knees. If these are feeble, the whole frame is feeble. Fear relaxes the strength of the arms, and the firmness of the knees; and the expressions 'weak hands,' and 'feeble knees,' become synonymous with saying, of a timid, fearful, and desponding frame of mind. Such were to be strengthened by the assurance of the favor of God, and by the consolations which would flow from the reign of the Messiah. The Jews, who looked abroad upon the desolations of their country, were to be comforted by the hope of future blessings; those who lived in those future times were to be consoled by the assurances of the favor of God through the Messiah (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Strengthen &#8230; hands &#8230; confirm &#8230; knees&#8212;The Hebrew for "strengthen" refers to the strength residing in the hand for grasping and holding a thing manfully; "confirm," to the firmness with which one keeps his ground, so as not to be dislodged by any other [Maurer].

In the Church of the redeemed there will be "weak" brethren as well as strong, "feeble" as well as healthful (see <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>). God, by the mouth of his prophet, calls on the strong to impart of their strength to their weaker brethren, uplifting their "weak hands," as Aaron and Hur did those of Moses (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>), and "confirming" or sustaining their "feeble knees." So St. Paul: "We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves" (<a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The allusion to the monarchy and the lofty electoral dignity leads the prophet on to the palaces and castles of the land. Starting with these, he carries out the picture of the ruins in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13-15</a>. "And the palaces of Edom break out into thorns, nettles and thistles in its castles; and it becomes the abode of wild dogs, pasture for ostriches. And martens meet with jackals, and a wood-devil runs upon its fellow; yea, Liiliith dwells there, and finds rest for itself. There the arrow-snake makes its nest, and breeds and lays eggs, and broods in the shadow there; yea, there vultures gather together one to another." The feminine suffixes refer to Edom, as they did in the previous instance, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. On the tann&#305;&#772;m, tsiyy&#305;&#772;m, and 'iyy&#305;&#772;m, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>. It is doubtful whether cha&#770;ts&#305;&#772;r here corresponds to the Arabic word for an enclosure ( equals  &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;), as Gesenius, Hitzig, and others suppose, as elsewhere to the Arabic for green, a green field, or garden vegetable. We take it in the latter sense, viz., a grassy place, such as was frequented by ostriches, which live upon plants and fruits. The word tsiyyim (steppe animals) we have rendered "martens," as the context requires a particular species of animals to be named. This is the interpretation given by Rashi (in loc.) and Kimchi in <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a> to the Targum word tamva&#770;n. We do not render 'iyy&#305;&#772;m "wild cats" (chattu&#772;ilin), but "jackals," after the Arabic. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; we take in the sense of &#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (as in <a href="/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>). L&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;th (Syr. and Zab. lelitho), lit., the creature of the night, was a female demon (she&#772;da&#770;h) of the popular mythology; according to the legends, it was a malicious fairy that was especially hurtful to children, like some of the fairies of our own fairy tales. There is life in Edom still; but what a caricature of that which once was there! In the very spot where the princes of Edom used to proclaim the new king, satyrs now invite one another to dance (<a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>); and there kings and princes once slept in their palaces and country houses, the l&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;th, which is most at home in horrible places, finds, as though after a prolonged search, the most convenient and most comfortable resting-place. Demons and serpents are not very far distant from one another. The prophet therefore proceeds in <a href="/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a> to the arrow-snake, or springing-snake (Arabic qiffa&#770;ze, from qa&#770;phaz, related to qa&#770;phats, Sol 2:8, to prepare for springing, or to spring; a different word from qippo&#772;d, which has the same root). This builds its nest in the ruins; there it breeds (mille&#772;t, to let its eggs slide out) and lays eggs (ba&#770;qa&#8219;, to split, i.e., to bring forth); and then it broods in the shade (da&#770;gar is the Targum word in <a href="/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a> for chimme&#772;m (ithpael in <a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a> for &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1512;), and is also used in the rabbinical writings for fovere, as Jerome renders it here). The literal sense of the word is probably to keep the eggs together (Targum, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;), since &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512; (syn. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;) signifies "to collect." Rashi has therefore explained it in both passages as meaning glousser, to cluck, the noise by which a fowl calls its brood together. The dayya&#770;h is the vulture. These fowls and most gregarious birds of prey also collect together there. </body></html>
