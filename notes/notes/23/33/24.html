The prophet, seeing in such a pestilence the punishment of iniquity, couples together the two blessings of health and pardon. Healthy, because holy, was his report as to the restored Jerusalem. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the inhabitant - The inhabitant of Jerusalem.<p>Shall not say, I am sick - That is, probably, the spoil shall be so abundant, and the facility for taking it so great, that even the sick, the aged, and the infirm shall go forth nerved with new vigor to gather the spoil.<p>The people that dwell therein - In Jerusalem.<p>Shall be forgiven their iniquity - This is equivalent to saying that the calamities of the invasion would be entirely removed. This invasion is represented as coming upon them as a judgment for their sins. When the Assyrian should be overthrown, it would be a proof that the sin which had been the cause of the invasion had been forgiven, and that God was now disposed to show them favor and mercy. It is common in the Scriptures to represent any calamity as the consequence of sin, to identify the removal of the calamity and the forgiveness of the sin. Thus, the Saviour said <a href="/mark/2-5.htm">Mark 2:5</a> to the man afflicted with the palsy, 'Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.' And when the scribes complained, he urged that the power of forgiving sins and of healing disease was the same, or that the forgiveness of sin was equivalent to the removal of disease <a href="/mark/2-9.htm">Mark 2:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. sick&#8212;Smith thinks the allusion is to the beginning of the pestilence by which the Assyrians were destroyed, and which, while sparing the righteous, affected some within the city ("sinners in Zion"); it may have been the sickness that visited Hezekiah (Isa 38:1-22). In the Jerusalem to come there shall be no "sickness," because there will be no "iniquity," it being forgiven (Ps 103:3). The latter clause of the verse contains the cause of the former (Mr 2:5-9).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The inhabitant, </span> to wit, of Jerusalem, God’s people, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall not say, I am sick; </span> shall have no cause to complain of any sickness or calamity; shall be fully delivered from all their enemies and evil occurrents; shall enjoy perfect tranquillity and prosperity. <span class="bld">The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity:</span> this may be added, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That is, the inhabitant of Zion, or Jerusalem, the church of Christ, <a href="/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a> and such are they that are born again in Zion, and brought up there; who are made free thereof by Christ; are brought to dwell here by the Lord himself; and, under the influence of divine grace, ask their way hither, and come willingly and cheerfully, and settle here: these, at this time the prophecy refers to, even the latter day, shall not be heard to say, not one of them, "I am sick"; either with the sickness of sin, so as to say there is no cure for them, or that they shall die of it, or even to complain of it; for all their sicknesses and diseases of this kind will be healed by the rising of the sun of righteousness upon them, with healing in his wings; or with the sickness of affliction, especially outward affliction of persecuting enemies, which will be at an end; and such joy will attend them, on account of their deliverance from them, that all their former sorrows and sufferings will be forgot; and in the New Jerusalem church state there will be neither one sickness nor another; no more sorrow, pain, or death; the leaves of the tree of life will be for the healing of the nations, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, <p>the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity; this shows that sin is the sickness meant; the manner in which such a disease is cured, by forgiveness; and the perfect health and soundness, as well as joy, and peace, and comfort, which follows upon an application of pardoning grace and mercy. The Targum refers this to the time when the Israelites shall return to their own land; and Kimchi owns that some of their interpreters apply it to the times of the Messiah. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

To the Old Testament saints sickness was the proof of God’s displeasure and of sin unforgiven. Hence in the conception of the Messianic community, the abolition of sickness, the chief evil of life, is the indispensable pledge that guilt is taken away.

"Thy heart meditates upon the shuddering. Where is the valuer? where the weigher? where he who counted the towers? The rough people thou seest no more, the people of deep inaudible lip, of stammering unintelligible tongue." The dreadful past is so thoroughly forced out of mind by the glorious present, that they are obliged to turn back their thoughts (ha&#770;ga&#770;h, meditari, as Jerome renders it) to remember it at all. The so&#772;phe&#772;r who had the management of the raising of the tribute, the sho&#772;qe&#772;l who tested the weight of the gold and silver, the so&#772;pher 'eth hammigda&#770;l who drew up the plan of the city to be besieged or stormed, are all vanished. The rough people (&#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1494; &#1506;&#1501;, the niphal of &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, from &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;), that had shown itself so insolent, so shameless, and so insatiable in its demands, has become invisible. This attribute is a perfectly appropriate one; and the explanation given by Rashi, Vitringa, Ewald, and Frst, who take it in the sense of lo&#772;&#8219;e&#772;z in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/114-1.htm">Psalm 114:1</a>, is both forced and groundless. The expressions &#8219;imke&#772; and nil&#8219;ag refer to the obscure and barbarous sound of their language; misshemo&#772;a&#774; to the unintelligibility of their speech; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; to the obscurity of their meaning. Even if the Assyrians spoke a Semitic language, they were of so totally different a nationality, and their manners were so entirely different, that their language must have sounded even more foreign to an Israelite than Dutch to a German. </body></html>
