Thus we learn from this period, that when the calamity of the people, as well as the insolence of their enemies, should be come to the height, God would delay no longer, but immediately interpose and severely punish the oppressors, and thereby exalt his glory before the eyes of the nations, whom he calls upon, in the next words, to consider his doings. <span class="ital">Hear, ye afar off, </span>&c. — So remarkable a judgment as this deserves to be known, and laid to heart, by all men, both far and near. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:1-14 Here we have the proud and false destroyer justly reckoned with for all his fraud and violence. The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now - This verse commences another transition. In the previous verses, the desolation of the land had been described, and the hopelessness of obtaining any terms of favor from Sennacherib, or of binding him to any compact, bad been stated. In this state of things, when inevitable ruin seemed to be coming upon the nation, God said that he would interpose.<p>Will I rise - To vengeance; or to punish the invading host. The emphasis in this passage should be placed on 'I,' indicating that Yahweh would himself do what could not be effected by people.<p>Now will I be exalted - That is, God would so interpose that it should be manifest that it was his hand that brought deliverance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

At the last extremity, when things are come to a crisis; his interest at the lowest, and the kingdom of antichrist at its highest pitch; the whore of Rome triumphing over the slain witnesses, and boasting she was a queen, and knew no sorrow: this will be God's fit time to exert himself, and get him honour and glory: he before was as one lain down and asleep, as if quite negligent and careless about his honour and interest; but now he determines to arise, and show himself strong on the behalf of it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>, <p>now will I be exalted; that is, in his power, by the destruction of the enemies of his church; and in the hearts and mouths of his people, on account of their deliverance and salvation: <p>now will I lift up myself; show himself above his enemies, higher and greater than they, and reduce them to a low estate and condition. The repetition of the word "now" has its emphasis; and is designed to observe the time of God's appearing in the cause of his people, and the fitness and propriety of it; and to quicken their attention to it, as well as to express the certainty of it, and the firmness of his resolution to do it without delay, and the vehemence and ardour with which he would set about it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now will I <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</span><p>(p) To help and deliver my Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10–13</span>.

Judah's extremity is Jehovah's opportunity. "Now" at length the time is come for God to show himself, tic will rise from his throne, and actively display his power; he will exalt himself above the heathen - lift himself up above the nations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>While the prophet is praying thus, he already sees the answer. "At the sound of a noise peoples pass away; at Thy rising nations are scattered. And your booty is swept away as a swarm of locusts sweeps away; as beetles run, they run upon it." The indeterminate ha&#770;mo&#772;n, which produces for that very reason the impression of something mysterious and terrible, is at once explained. The noise comes from Jehovah, who is raising Himself judicially above Assyria, and thunders as a judge. Then the hostile army runs away (&#1504;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1504;&#1508;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, from the niphal &#1504;&#1508;&#1509;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a>, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1509;  equals  &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1509;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;); and your booty (the address returns to Assyria) is swept away, just as when a swarm of locusts settles on a field, it soon eats it utterly away. Jerome, Cappellus, and others follow the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. The figure is quite as appropriate, but the article in hecha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l makes the other view the more natural one; and <a href="/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a> places this beyond all doubt. Sha&#770;qaq, from which the participle sho&#772;qe&#772;q and the substantive massha&#770;q are derived, is sued here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>, to signify a busy running hither and thither (discursitare). The syntactic use of sho&#772;qe&#772;q is the same as that of &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (they call) in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>, and so&#772;phed&#305;&#772;m (they smite) in <a href="/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>. The inhabitants of Jerusalem swarm in the enemy's camp like beetles; they are all in motion, and carry off what they can. </body></html>
