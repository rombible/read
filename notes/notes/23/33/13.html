The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, ye that are far off - This is an address of Yahweh, indicating that the destruction of the Assyrian army would be so signal that it would be known to distant nations, and would constitute an admonition to them.<p>Ye that are near - Ye Jews; or the nations immediately adjacent to Judea.

The prophet's first thought <span class="accented">is</span>, how wonderfully the overthrow has manifested the might of God (ver. 13). Next, how it must thrill with fear the hearts of the wicked among his people (ver. 14). Thirdly, how the righteous are by it placed in security, and can look back with joy to their escape, and can with confidence look forward to a future of happiness and tranquil lily (vers. 15-24). Messianic ideas intermingle with these latter thoughts (vers. 17, 23), the image of a happy, tranquil Judah melting into that of Messiah's glorious kingdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye that are far off</span>, etc. Jehovah speaks by the mouth of his prophet, and calls on the nations of the earth, far and near, to consider and acknowledge his might, as shown in his judgment on <span class="accented">Assyria</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet has thus run through the whole train of thought with a few rapid strides, in accordance with the custom which we have already frequently noticed; and now he commences afresh, mourning over the present miserable condition of things, in psalm-like elegiac tones, and weeping with his weeping people. "Behold, their heroes weep without; the messengers of peace weep bitterly. Desolate are roads, disappeared are travellers; he has broken covenant, insulted cities, despised men. The land mourns, languishes; Lebanon stands ashamed, parched; the meadow of Sharon has become like a steppe, and Bashan and Carmel shake their leaves." &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is probably chosen with some allusion to 'Ariel, the name of Jerusalem in chapter 29; but it has a totally different meaning. We have rendered it "heroes," because &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is here synonymous with &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in the Nibelung-like piece contained in <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>. This 'a&#774;r&#305;&#772;'e&#772;l, which is here contracted into 'er'el (compare the biblical name 'Ar'e&#772;l&#305;&#772; and the post-biblical name of the angels, 'Er'ell&#305;&#772;m), is compounded of 'ar&#305;&#772; (a lion) and &#8219;El (God), and therefore signifies "the lion of God," but in this sense, that El (God) gives to the idea of leonine courage merely the additional force of extraordinary or wonderful; and as a composite word, it contents itself with a singular, with a collective sense according to circumstances, without forming any plural at all. The dagesh is to be explained from the fact that the word (which tradition has erroneously regarded as a compound of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;) is pointed in accordance with the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; (&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;). The heroes intended by the prophet were the messengers sent to Sennacherib to treat with him for peace. They carried to him the amount of silver and gold which he had demanded as the condition of peace (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>). But Sennacherib broke the treaty, by demanding nothing less than the surrender of Jerusalem itself. Then the heroes of Jerusalem cried aloud, when they arrived at Jerusalem, and had to convey this message of disgrace and alarm to the king and nation; and bitterly weeping over such a breach of faith, such deception and disgrace, the embassy, which had been sent off, to the deep self-humiliation of Judah and themselves, returned to Jerusalem. Moreover, Sennacherib continued to storm the fortified places, in violation of his agreement (on ma&#770;'as &#8219;ar&#305;&#772;m, see <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>). The land was more and more laid waste, the fields were trodden down; and the autumnal aspect of Lebanon, with its faded foliage, and of Bashan and Carmel, with their falling leaves, looked like shame and grief at the calamities of the land. It was in the autumn, therefore, that the prophet uttered these complaints; and the definition of the time given in his prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>) coincides with this. &#1511;&#1502;&#1500; is the pausal form for &#1511;&#1502;&#1500;, just as in other places an e&#772; with the tone, which has sprung from i, easily passes into a in pause; the sharpening of the syllable being preferred to the lengthening of it, not only when the syllable which precedes the tone syllable is an open one, but sometimes even when it is closed (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;). Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; we should read &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (without the article), as certain codd. and early editions do.<p>(Note: We find the same in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>, whereas we invariably have &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (see Michlol, 45b), just as we always find &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, and on the other hand &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;.)<p>Isaiah having mourned in the tone of the Psalms, now comforts himself with the words of a psalm. Like David in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>, he hears Jehovah speak. The measure of Asshur's iniquity is full; the hour of Judah's redemption is come; Jehovah has looked on long enough, as though sitting still (<a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>). <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a> "Now will I arise, saith Jehovah, now exalt myself, now lift up myself." Three times does the prophet repeat the word &#8219;atta&#770;h (now), which is so significant a word with all the prophets, but more especially with Hosea and Isaiah, and which always fixes the boundary-line and turning-point between love and wrath, wrath and love. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (in half pause for &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1488; is contracted from &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (Ges. 54, 2, b). Jehovah would rise up from His throne, and show Himself in all His greatness to the enemies of Israel. </body></html>
