The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt not see a fierce people - Or, rather, 'this fierce and boasting people you shall not see.' They shall not enter the city; but though they are advancing with so much confidence, they shall be suddenly cut, off and destroyed. The word rendered "fierce," (&#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1494;  no&#770;&#8219;a&#770;z from &#1504;&#1506;&#1494;  ya&#770;&#8219;az), probably means strong, or wicked. Lowth renders it, 'barbarous people,' as if it were &#1500;&#1493;&#1506;&#1494;  lo&#770;&#8219;e&#772;z. Michaelis also adopts this reading by supposing an error in transcribing, a change of the Hebrew letter &#1504;  (n) into the Hebrew letter &#1500;  (l). Such a change might have easily occurred, but there is no authority from the manuscripts for making an alteration in the text The word strong, or mighty, agrees well with the connection.<p>A people of a deeper speech - A people whose language is so deep, that is, so dark, or obscure, that it cannot be understood by you. This refers to the army of the Assyrians, who spoke the Syrian language, which was understood by some of the Jews, but which was unintelligible to the mass (see <a href="/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11</a>).<p>Than thou canst perceive - Than you can understand.<p>Of a stammering tongue - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11</a>).

The judgment upon Asshur is an alarming lesson, not only for the heathen, but for Israel also; for there is no respect of persons with Jehovah. "Hear, ye distant ones, what I have accomplished; and perceive, ye near ones, my omnipotence! The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the hypocrites: who of us can abide with devouring fire? who of us abide with everlasting burnings?" Even for the sinners in Jerusalem also there is no abiding in the presence of the Almighty and Just One, who has judged Asshur (the act of judgment is regarded by the prophet as having just occurred); they must either repent, or they cannot remain in His presence. Jehovah, so far as His wrath is concerned, is "a consuming fire" (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>); and the fiery force of His anger is "everlasting burnings" (mo&#772;kede&#772; &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m), inasmuch as it consists of flames that are never extinguished, never burn themselves out. And this God had His fire and His furnace in Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>), and had just shown what His fire could do, when once it burst forth. Therefore do the sinners inquire in their alarm, whilst confessing to one another (la&#770;nu&#772;; cf., <a href="/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>) that none of them can endure it, "Who can dwell with devouring fire?" etc. (gu&#772;r with the acc. loci, as in <a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>). </body></html>
