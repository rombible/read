This will have a further accomplishment, in the deliverance of the Lord's people from the mighty and terrible beast of Rome: <p>for I will contend with them that contend with thee; the Babylonians literally; Satan and his principalities figuratively; and also antichrist, and the antichristian kings and states, that quarrel with, fight against, and oppress the Lord's people: <p>and I will save thy children; regenerate persons, the members of the church, be they where they will; these the Lord will save with a temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation, Deliverance from the Romish yoke and oppression seems to be here chiefly designed, when Jezebel's children will be killed with death, as follows; see <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>. <p>(u)  "captura violenti", Moutanus Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "turba captiva violenti", Vitringa. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But thus saith the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</span><p>(e) This is the answer to their objection, that no one is stronger than the Lord, neither has a more just title to them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>.

The answer to the questions of ver. 24 is that, if Babylon is mighty, God is mightier. God will "take away" the captives, and "save" his "children." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus will Zion shine forth once more with the multitude of her children as with a festal adorning. "For thy ruins and thy waste places and thy land full of ruin - yea, now thou wilt be too narrow for the inhabitants, and thy devourers are far away. Thy children, that were formerly taken from thee, shall say in thine ears, The space is too narrow for me; give way for me, that I may have room." The word "for" (k&#305;&#772;) introduces the explanatory reason for the figures just employed of jewellery and a bridal girdle. Instead of the three subjects, "thy ruins," etc., the comprehensive "thou" is employed permutatively, and the sentence commenced afresh. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is repeated emphatically in &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (for now, or yea now); this has essentially the same meaning as in the apodosis of hypothetical protasis (e.g., <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>), except that the sense is more decidedly affirmative than in the present instance, where one sees it spring out of the confirmative. Zion, that has been hitherto desolate, now becomes too small to hold her inhabitants; and her devourers are far away, i.e., those who took forcible possession of the land and cities, and made them untenable. &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; is to be understood in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>, and &#1489;&#1506;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; in accordance with <a href="/psalms/54-2.htm">Psalm 54:2</a> (see at <a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>). It will even come to this, that the children of which Zion was formerly robbed will call to one another, so that she becomes a witness with her ears to that which they have so clearly seen: the space is too narrow, give way (gesha&#770;h, from na&#770;gash, to advance, then to move generally, also to move in an opposite direction, i.e., to fall back, as in <a href="/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>) for me, that I may be able to settle down. </body></html>
