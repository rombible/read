Man, whom he came to save, put contempt upon him. To this he submitted for our salvation. He is a pledge for all the blessings of the covenant; in him God was reconciling the world to himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law; renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin: both are from Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves. Not only see, but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts. Though there are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace of God will carry us over them, and make even the mountains a way.

The sense is, that Yahweh had promised to him who was despised and rejected, that kings and princes should yet rise up and honor him.<p>The Redeemer of Israel - (See the note at <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>To him whom man despiseth - On the construction of the Hebrew here, see Gesenius, Vitringa, and Hengstenberg. The phrase &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  libezoh-nephesh (to the despised of soul), means evidently one who is despised, rejected, contemned by people. The word 'soul' here (&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh) means the same as man; that is, every man. It was a characteristic of him that he was despised and rejected by all; and the prophet, in this verse, has given a summary of all that be has said respecting him in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>.<p>To him whom the nation abhorreth - The word 'nation' here refers doubtless to the Jewish people, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. The word rendered 'abhorreth' means "for an abomination" (&#1500;&#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;  limeta&#770;&#8219;e&#772;b), Piel participle, from &#1514;&#1506;&#1489;  ta&#770;&#8219;ab), and the idea is, that he was regarded as an abomination by the people. The same idea is more fully expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-4</a>, that the Messiah would be rejected and treated with abhorrence by the nation as such - a statement which the slightest acquaintance with the New Testament will lead anyone to see has been literally fulfilled. No being ever excited more abhorrence; no man was ever regarded with so much abomination by any people as Jesus of Nazareth was, and still is, by the Jewish people. He was condemned by the Sanhedrim; publicly rejected by the nation; and at the instigation and by the desire of the assembled people at Jerusalem, he was executed as a malefactor in the most shameful and ignominious manner then known (see <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18-23</a>). To this day, his name excites the utmost contempt among Jews, and they turn from him and his claims with the deepest abhorrence. The common name by which he is designated in the Jewish writings is Tolvi - 'the crucified;' and nothing excites more deep abhorrence and contempt than the doctrine that they, and all others, can be saved only by the merits of 'the crucified.' The Chaldee renders all this in the plural, 'To those who are contemned among the people, to those who have migrated to ether kingdoms, to those who serve other lords.'<p>To a servant of rulers - This probably means that the Messiah voluntarily submitted himself to human power, and yielded obedience to human rulers. The idea, if interpreted by the facts as recorded in the New Testament, is, that though he was the ruler of all worlds, yet he voluntarily became subject to human laws, and yielded submission and obedience to human rulers. For this purpose he conformed to the existing institutions of his country at the time when he lived; he paid the customary tax or tribute that was laid for the support of religion <a href="/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a>; he submitted to a trial before the Sanhedrim, and before Pilate, though both were conducted in a manner that violated all the principles of justice; and he submitted to the unjust decree which condemned him to die. He was, therefore, all his life, subject to rulers. He was not only exemplary and strict in obeying the laws of the land; but he became, in a more strict sense, their servant, as he was deprived of his liberty, comfort, and life at their caprice. He refrained himself from exerting his divine power, and voluntarily became subject to the will of others.<p>Kings shall see and arise - That is, kings shall see this, and shall rise up with demonstrations of respect and reverence. They shall see the fulfillment of the divine promises by which he is destined to be the light of the nations, and they shall render him honor as their teacher and Redeemer. To rise up, or to prostrate themselves, are both marks of respect and veneration.<p>Princes also shall worship - The word used here, (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;  y&#305;&#770;shettacha&#774;vu&#770;), from     &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;  sha&#770;cha&#770;h) means "to bow down, to incline oneself"; it then means "to prostrate oneself" before anyone, in order to do him honor or reverence. This was the customary mode of showing respect or reverence in the East. It consisted generally in falling upon the knees, and then touching the forehead to the ground, and is often alluded to in the Bible (see <a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>). This honor was paid not only to kings and princes as superior <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>, but also to equals <a href="/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm">Genesis 37:9-10</a>. It was the customary form of religious homage, as it is still in the East, and denoted sometimes religious worship <a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; but not necessarily, or always (see the note at <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>; compare <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-25.htm">Matthew 15:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-26.htm">Matthew 18:26</a>; <a href="/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a>). Here it does not mean that they would render to him religious homage, but that they would show him honor, or respect.<p>Because of the Lord that is faithful - It is because Yahweh is faithful in the fulfillment of his promises, and will certainly bring this to pass. The fact that he shall be thus honored shall be traced entirely to the faithfulness era covenant-keeping God.<p>And he shall choose thee - Select thee to accomplish this, and to be thus a light to the pagan world. It is needless to say that this has been fulfilled. Kings and princes have bowed before the Redeemer; and the time will yet come when in far greater numbers they shall adore him. It is as needless to say, that these expressions can be applied to no other one than the Messiah. It was not true of Isaiah that he was the light of the pagan, or for salvation to the ends of the earth; nor was it true of him that kings arose and honored him, or that princes prostrated themselves before him, and did him reverence. Of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus alone, was all this true; and the assurance is thus given, that though he was rejected by his own nation, yet the time will come when the kings and princes of all the world shall do him homage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. whom man despiseth&#8212;Hebrew, "the despised of soul," that is, by every soul, by all men (Isa 52:14, 15; 53:3; 50:6-9; Ps 22:6).

According to a tradition  - which, however, cannot be traced back to any very ancient source - the Magi who came to worship our Lord at Bethlehem   were "kings."

And He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand hath He hid me, and made me into a polished shaft; in His quiver hath He concealed me. And He said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, thou in whom I glorify myself." Although the speaker is called Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>, he must not be regarded as either a collective person representing all Israel, or as the collective personality of the kernel of Israel, which answered to its true idea. It is not the former, because in <a href="/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a> he is expressly distinguished from the nation itself, which is the immediate object of his special work as restorer and (according to <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>) covenant-mediator also; not the latter, because the nation, whose restoration he effects, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>, was not something distinct from the collective personality of the "servant of Jehovah" in a national sense, but rather the entire body of the "servants of Jehovah" or remnant of Israel (see, for example, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8-16</a>). Moreover, it cannot be either of these, because what he affirms of himself is expressed in such terms of individuality, that they cannot be understood as employed in a collective sense at all, more especially where he speaks of his mother's womb. In every other case in which Israel is spoken of in this way, we find only "from the womb" (mibbeten, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>, along with minn&#305;&#772;-racham; also <a href="/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>), without the addition of &#1488;&#1501; (mother), which is quite unsuitable to the collective body of the nation (except in such allegorical connections as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1-2</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>). Is it then possibly the prophet, who is here speaking of himself and refers in <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a> to his own mother (compare &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17</a>)? This is very improbable, if only because the prophet, who is the medium of the word of God in these prophecies, has never placed himself in the foreground before. In <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a> he merely speaks of himself indirectly; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>, even if he refer to himself at all (which we greatly doubt), it is only objectively; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a>, the other person, into whose words the words of Jehovah pass, cannot be the prophet, for the simple reason that the transition of the words of Jehovah into those of His messenger is essentially different in this instance from the otherwise frequent interchange of the words of Jehovah and those of His prophet, and also because the messenger of Jehovah speaks of himself there, after the "former things" have come to pass, as the mediator (either in word or deed) of the "new things" which were never heard of before, but are to be expected now; whereas the author of these addresses was also the prophet of the "former things," and therefore the messenger referred to rises up within the course of sacred history predicted by the author of these prophecies. Moreover, what the speaker in this case (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-2</a>) says of himself is so unique, so glorious, that it reaches far beyond the vocation and performance of any single prophet, or, in fact, of any individual man subject to the limitations of human life and human strength.<p>There is nothing else left, therefore, than to suppose that the idea implied in the expression "servant of Jehovah" is condensed in this instance, as in <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>., into that of a single person. When it is expanded to its widest circumference, the "servant of Jehovah" is all Israel; when it only covers its smaller and inner circle, it is the true people of Jehovah contained within the entire nation, like the kernel in the shell (see the definition of this at <a href="/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-10.htm">Isaiah 65:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>); but here it goes back to its very centre. The "servant of Jehovah," in this central sense, is the heart of Israel. From this heart of Israel the stream of salvation flows out, first of all through the veins of the people of God, and thence through the veins of the nations generally. Just as Cyrus is the world-power in person, as made subservient to the people of God, so the servant of Jehovah, who is speaking here, is Israel in person, as promoting the glorification of Jehovah in all Israel, and in all the world of nations: in other words, it is He in whom the true nature of Israel is concentrated like a sun, in whom the history of Israel is coiled up as into a knot for a further and final development, in whom Israel's world-wide calling to be the Saviour of mankind, including Israel itself, is fully carried out; the very same who took up the word of Jehovah in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a>, in the full consciousness of His fellowship with Him, declaring Himself to be His messenger who had now appeared. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that throughout these prophecies the breaking forth of salvation, not for Israel only, but for all mankind, is regarded as bound up with the termination of the captivity; and from this its basis, the restoration of the people who were then in exile, it is never separated. This fact is of great importance in relation to the question of authorship, and favours the conclusion that they emanated from a prophet who lived before the captivity, and not in the midst of it. Just as in chapter 7 Isaiah sees the son of the virgin grow up in the time of the Assyrian oppressions, and then sees his kingdom rising up on the ruins of the Assyrian; so does he here behold the servant of Jehovah rising up in the second half of the captivity, as if born in exile, in the midst of the punishment borne by his people, to effect the restoration of Israel. At the present time, when he begins to speak, coming forward without any further introduction, and speaking in his own name (a unique instance of dramatic style, which goes beyond even <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a>), he has already left behind him the commencement of his work, which was directed towards the salvation of mankind. His appeal is addressed to the "isles," which had been frequently mentioned already when the evangelization of the heathen was spoken of (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a>; cf., <a href="/isaiah/24-15.htm">Isaiah 24:15</a>), and to the "nations from afar," i.e., the distant nations (as in <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; compare, on the other hand, <a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>). They are to hear what he says, not merely what he says in the words that follow, but what he says generally. What follows is rather a vindication of his right to demand a hearing and obedience, then the discourse itself, which is to be received with the obedience of faith; at the same time, the two are most intimately connected. Jehovah has called him ab utero, has thought of his name from the bowels of his mother (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497; as in <a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>), i.e., even before he was born; ever since his conception has Jehovah assigned to him his calling, viz., his saving calling. We call to mind here <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>, but above all the name Immanuel, which is given by anticipation to the Coming One in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, and the name Jesus, which God appointed through the mouth of angels, when the human life of Him who was to bear that name was still ripening in the womb of the Virgin (<a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20-23</a>). It is worthy of notice, however, that the great Coming One, though he is described in the Old Testament as one who is to be looked for "from the seed of David," is also spoken of as "born of a woman," whenever his entrance into the world is directly referred to. In the Protevangelium he is called, though not in an individual sense, "the seed of the woman;" Isaiah, in the time of Ahaz, mentions "the virgin" as his mother; Micah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>) speaks of his &#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492;; even the typical psalms, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10-11</a>, give prominence to the mother. And is not this a sign that prophecy is a work of the Spirit, who searches out the deep things of the counsel of God? <p>In <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a> the speaker says still further, that Jehovah has made his mouth kecherebh chadda&#770;h (like a sharp sword), namely, that he may overcome everything that resists him as if with a sharp sword, and sever asunder things that are bound up together in a pernicious bond (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>); also that He has made him into che&#772;ts ba&#770;ru&#772;r (not &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, lxx, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, cleaned,<p>(Note: The comparison to purus is one that naturally suggests itself; but this, like putus, is derived from a root pu&#772;.)<p>polished, sharpened, pointed), namely, to pierce the hearts (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>), and inflict upon them the most wholesome wounds; and again, that Jehovah has hidden him under the shadow of His almighty hand, and kept him concealed in the quiver of His loving counsel, just girt as men keep their swords and arrows in sheaths and quivers ready for the time when they want to use them, in order that in the fulness of time He might draw out this His sword, and put this His arrow to the bow. The question whether the allusion here is to the time preceding the foreknown period of his coming, or whether it is to eternity that the words refer, does not present any great dilemma; at the same time, the prophecy in this instance only traces back the being of the person, who now appears, to the remotest point of his historical coming. <a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a> describes, without any figure, what Jehovah has made him. He has said to him (cf., <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>): Thou art my servant; thou art Israel, in whom (in quo, as in <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>) I glorify myself. Schenkel's exposition is grammatically impossible: "(It is) in Israel that I will glorify myself through thee." The servant himself is called Israel. We call to mind here the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>, "Thou art Peter;" and the use of the name "Israel," as the individuation of a generic name, reminds us of the fact that the kings of a nation are sometimes called by the name of the nation itself (e.g., Asshur, <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>.). But Israel was from the very first the God-given name of an individual. Just as the name Israel was first of all given to a man, and then after that to a nation, so the name which sprang from a personal root has also a personal crown. The servant of Jehovah is Israel in person, inasmuch as the purpose of mercy, upon the basis of which and for the accomplishment of which Jehovah made Jacob the father of the twelve-tribed nation, is brought by him into full and final realization. We have already seen that Israel, as an entire nation, formed the basis of the idea contained in the term "servant of Jehovah;" Israel, regarded as a people faithful to its calling, the centre; and the personal servant of Jehovah its apex. In the present instance, where he is called distinctly "Israel," the fact is clearly expressed, that the servant of Jehovah in these prophecies is regarded as the kernel of the kernel of Israel, as Israel's inmost centre, as Israel's highest head. He it is in whom (i.e., on whom and through whom) Jehovah glorifies Himself, inasmuch as He carried out through him the counsels of His love, which are the self-glorification of His holy love, its glory and its triumph. </body></html>
