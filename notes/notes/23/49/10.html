Man, whom he came to save, put contempt upon him. To this he submitted for our salvation. He is a pledge for all the blessings of the covenant; in him God was reconciling the world to himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law; renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin: both are from Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves. Not only see, but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts. Though there are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace of God will carry us over them, and make even the mountains a way.

In the book of Revelation, this entire passage is applied <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16-17</a> to the happiness of the redeemed in heaven, and the use which is made of it there is not foreign to the sense in Isaiah. It means that the Messiah as a shepherd shall abundantly satisfy all the needs of his people; and it may with as much propriety be applied to the joys of heaven, as to the happiness which they will experience on earth. Their longing desires for holiness and salvation; their hungering and thirsting after righteousness <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, shall be abundantly satisfied.<p>Neither shall the heat nor sun smite them - In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a>, this is, 'Neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat;' that is, the burning heat of the sun shall not oppress them - an image of refreshment, protection, and joy, as when the traveler in burning sands finds the grateful shade of a rock or of a grove (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-3.htm">Isaiah 14:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>). The word rendered here 'heat' (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;  sha&#770;ra&#770;b), denotes properly heat, burning; and then the heated vapor which in burning deserts produces the phenomenon of the mirage (see it explained in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>). It is equivalent here to intense heat; and means that they shall not be exposed to any suffering like that of the intense heat of the burning sun reflected from sandy wastes.<p>For he that hath mercy on them - That God and Saviour who shall have redeemed them shall be their shepherd and their guide, and they shall have nothing to fear.<p>Even by the springs of water - In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, 'Shall lead them unto living fountains of waters' (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>). The whole figure in this verse is taken from the character of a faithful shepherd who conducts his flock to places where they may feed in plenty; who guards them from the intense heat of a burning sun on sandy plains; and who leads them beside cooling and refreshing streams. It is a most beautiful image of the tender care of the Great Shepherd of his people in a world like this - a world in its main features, in regard to real comforts, not unaptly compared to barren hills, and pathless burning sands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Being fed in the ways and high places of Gospel ordinances with the love of God, with covenant mercies and precious promises, with Christ, the bread of life, and his grace the water of life, and with the doctrines of the Gospel; they do not desire carnal things, as formerly, but spiritual ones, which they have and are satisfied with, and desire no other food: it signifies that there shall be no famine of the word, nor want of spiritual provisions; it is applied to the New Jerusalem state, <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a> and so the following clause, <p>neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; not the sun of persecution, nor the heat of fiery trials and afflictions, particularly in the latter day; nor the heat of a fiery law and divine wrath, or of Satan's fiery darts; not however in the above mentioned state, or in the ultimate glory: <p>for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them; Christ, the great and good Shepherd of the sheep, who had mercy on them in eternity, and therefore undertook to feed them; and in time, and therefore laid down his life for them; and now in heaven, and sympathizes with him; and at the last day they shall find mercy with him: these he leads out of a state of nature, from the wilderness, where he finds them; out of their sinful ways, and from the pastures of their own righteousness; and he leads them in paths they had not known, in which they should go, in the way of truth, faith, and holiness; in right, though sometimes rough ways; he leads them to himself, his blood, righteousness, and fulness; into his Father's presence, and to his house and ordinances; into Gospel truths, and from one degree of grace to another, and at last to eternal glory; all which he does gradually, softly, gently, in proportion to their strength, and as they are able to bear: <p>even by the springs of water shall he guide them; or "fountains of water" (d); even of living water; which are no other than God himself, and the plenty of his grace and mercy; Christ, and the fulness of grace that is in him; the covenant of grace, and the blessings of it; the Gospel, and its ordinances; see <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>. <p>(d)  , Sept.

"And I, I said, I have wearied myself in vain, and thrown away my strength for nothing and to no purpose; yet my right is with Jehovah, and my reward with my God." The Vav with which the v. opens introduces the apparent discrepancy between the calling he had received, and the apparent failure of his work. &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, however, denotes the conclusion which might be drawn from this, that there was neither reality nor truth in his call. The relation between the clauses is exactly the same as that in <a href="/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a> and <a href="/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a> (where we find &#1488;&#1498;, which is more rarely used in this adversative sense); compare also <a href="/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a> (but I said), and the psalm of Hezekiah in <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a> with the antithesis in <a href="/psalms/38-15.htm">Psalm 38:15</a>. In the midst of his activity no fruit was to be seen, and the thought came upon him, that it was a failure; but this disturbance of his rejoicing in his calling was soon quieted in the confident assurance that his mishpa&#770;t (i.e., his good right in opposition to all contradiction and resistance) and his "work" (i.e., the result and fruit of the work, which is apparently in vain) are with Jehovah, and laid up with Him until the time when He will vindicate His servant's right, and crown his labour with success. We must not allow ourselves to be led astray by such parallels as <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>. The words are not spoken in a collective capacity any more than in the former part of the verse; the lamentation of Israel as a people, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>, is expressed very differently. </body></html>
