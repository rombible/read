Be assured that God has a tender affection for his church and people; he would not have them to be discouraged. Some mothers do neglect their children; but God's compassions to his people, infinitely exceed those of the tenderest parents toward their children. His setting them as a mark on his hand, or a seal upon his arm, denotes his being ever mindful of them.

The idea in this verse is, that it was an occasion on which the heavens and the earth would have cause to exult together. It is common in Isaiah thus to interpose a song of praise on the announcement of any great and glorious truth, and to call on the heavens and the earth to rejoice together (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

While the future is thus glorious, both for the "Servant of the Lord" and for his people Israel, the present is gloom and misery. Zion - not here the city, but the people of God - desponds and says, "Jehovah has forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me" (ver. 14). This burst of grief, though arising from weakness of faith, is forgiven by the compassion of God,   and "afflicted" Israel is "comforted" and consoled through the remainder of the chapter (vers. 15-26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O heavens</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>).

He expects them to be especially ready to sympathize with man. Such a feeling would be natural to one accustomed to the hill-country of Palestine and the lofty heights of Hermon and Lebanon, but could scarcely have been developed in an exile of the time of Cyrus, born and brought up in the dead level of Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">comforted...  will have mercy.</span> Both verbs designate the same action, which is really future, but in God's counsels is already accomplished.

His present condition is one of the deepest humiliation. "Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to him of contemptible soul, to the abhorrence of the people, to the servant of tyrants: kings shall see and arise; princes, and prostrate themselves for the sake of Jehovah, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, that He hath chosen thee." As ba&#770;zo&#772;h with a changeable kamtez (cf., cha&#770;mo&#772;ts, <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>) has, if not exactly a passive force, yet something very like a passive circumstantial meaning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; must mean the man who is contemptible as regards his soul, i.e., held in contempt, or, as Hofmann explains it, whom men do not think worthy to live (though he follows Ewald, and takes bezo&#772;h as an infinitive treated as a substantive). Accordingly &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; is also to be taken personally. The meaning abhorring is unsuitable; but &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; is also used in a causative sense, to cause to abhor, i.e., to make a thing an abomination (<a href="/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a>), or to excite abhorrence: hence, "to him who excites the people's abhorrence," which is the same, so far as the sense is concerned, as "to the object of their abhorrence." But even as a participial substantive &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; would literally mean the thing exciting abhorrence, i.e., the abhorrence, just as mekhasseh in <a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a> signifies the thing covering, i.e., the covering. All these participial substantives of the piel indicate the thing, place, or instrument accomplishing that which the piel affirms. We need not raise the question whether go&#772;i refers to Israel or to the heathen. It signifies the mass of men, the people, like &#8219;a&#770;m in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>, and in those passages in which it is used by our prophet for the human race generally. The mo&#772;sheilim, of whom the person here addressed is the servant or enslaved one, are obviously heathen tyrants. What is here affirmed of the "one servant of Jehovah" was no doubt also applicable to the nation generally, and more especially to that portion of the nation which was true to its calling and confession. He in whom Israel's relation of servant to Jehovah was fully realized, did indeed spring out of His own nation, when it was under the oppression of the powers of this world; and all the shame and persecution which those who remained faithful among His people had to endure from the heathen oppressors, and also from the ungodly among their own countrymen (see, for example, <a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>), discharge their force like a violent storm upon Him as an individual. When, therefore, we find the sufferings of the people and the glory of which they became partakers described in other passages in just the same terms, we must not infer from this that "servant of Jehovah" is a collective epithet in the passage before us. The person addressed here is the Restorer of Israel, the Light of the Gentiles, the Salvation of Jehovah for all mankind. When kings and princes shall behold Him who was once brought so low, delivered from His humiliation, and exalted to the glorious height of the work to which He has been called, they will rise up with reverence from their thrones, and prostrate themselves upon the ground in worship for the sake of Jehovah, as before Him who (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; emphatic, utpote qui) is faithful, showing Himself sincere in His promises, and for the sake of the Holy One of Israel, in that, as is now made manifest, "He hath chosen thee." The fut. consec. particularizes the general motive assigned, and carries it still further. </body></html>
