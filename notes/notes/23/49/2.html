But even the Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry, often seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought back to God, and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious. This promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Men perish in darkness.

The mouth here, by an obvious figure, stands for discourse. The comparison of words that are pungent, penetrating, powerful, to a sword, is common. Indeed the very terms that I have incidentally used, 'pungent,' 'penetrating,' are instances of the same kind of figure, and are drawn from a needle, or anything sharp and pointed, that penetrates. Instances of this occur in the following places in the Scriptures: 'The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies' <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>. 'The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow' <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, probably in reference to this passage, the Redeemer is represented as seen by John as having a 'sharp two-edged sword' proceeding out of his mouth. So in <a href="/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> : 'And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword.' The bold and striking metaphor of the sword and arrow applied to powerful discourse, has been used also by pagan writers with great elegance and force. In the passages quoted by Lowth, it is said of Pericles by Aristophanes:<p>'His powerful speech<p>Pierced the hearer's soul, and left behind<p>Deep in his bosom its keen point infixt.'<p>So Pindar, Olym. ii.:160:<p>'Come on! thy brighest shafts prepare,<p>And bend, O Muse, thy sounding bow:<p>Say, through what paths of liquid air<p>Our arrows shall we throw?'<p>West<p>A similar expression occurs in a fragment of Eupolis, in Diod. Sic. xii. 40, when speaking of Pericles:<p> - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;<p>&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;.<p> - kai monos to&#772;n re&#772;toro&#772;n<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. my mouth &#8230; sword&#8212;(Isa 11:4; Re 19:15).

Or, <p>"he hath put his words in my mouth as a sharp sword,'' <p>as the Targum; namely, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and is sharper than a twoedged sword, and is said to come out of the mouth of Christ, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, with which he pierces into and cuts the hearts of men, and lays open all their sin and unrighteousness, and cuts down the worst and best in men, and slays all his enemies; so his mouth was as a sharp sword in the days of his flesh, to inveigh against the sins and to refute the errors of the Scribes and Pharisees; as it will be, in the latter day, to smite the nations of the earth, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, "in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me"; in his counsels and purposes of old, and in his providence; <p>"in the shadow of his power hath he protected me,'' <p>as the Targum; thus he hid, and protected him from Herod's cruelty in his infancy; and from the rage and malice of the Scribes and Pharisees, who sought often to lay hands on him, and take away his life before his time. The Jews talk very much of the Messiah's being hid under the throne of glory. Aben Ezra's remark, that the phrase, "he hath hid me", answers to the scabbard of a sword, before mentioned, is not amiss: <p>and made me a polished shaft; or, "choice arrow" (s); which being polished at the point, or well oiled, and shining, pierces the deeper, So the doctrines of Christ, the words of his mouth, are compared to bright and sharp arrows, which make cutting work, and give great pain where they come; as they sometimes do like arrows, swiftly, suddenly, and with great force and power, <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>. Kimchi observes, that he speaks of a sharp sword with respect to the Jews that were near, where a sword could reach them; and of a polished shaft or arrow with respect to the Gentiles afar off, which must be cast after them: <p>in his quiver hath he hid me, meaning his secret purposes, and his powerful protection, as before; which he compares to a quiver, a case in which arrows are put, because mention had been made of a polished shaft or arrow before. <p>(s)   Sept.

The Servant is described as one prepared in secret for his great work. He compares himself to a weapon fashioned by Jehovah for His own use, but kept in reserve till the fulness of time. As the ideal prophet, he speaks of his <span class="ital">mouth</span>, the organ of prophetic utterance (see <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm" title="Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm" title="And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.">Isaiah 6:7</a>), as made <span class="ital">like a sharp sword</span> in virtue of the “word” which Jehovah puts in it (ch. <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm" title="And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are my people.">Isaiah 51:16</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me</span>] (ch. <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm" title="And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are my people.">Isaiah 51:16</a>).

The fundamental thought, translated into modern language, would be that prophecy is the highest expression of the genius of Israel; and the idealised nation is naturally identified with what is best and most characteristic in its history, and invested with the character of the ideal prophet. And again, Jehovah’s hiding of His Servant may express the truth that Israel had been providentially preserved through long ages for the sake of the spiritual endowments which made it the mouthpiece of revelation. The further idea that the real mission of Israel was concealed both from the world and from the nation itself is no doubt true, but is perhaps hardly contained in the figure.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword</span>. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that "the Word of God" generally "is... sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow" (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Christian experience testifies that tiffs keen, searching, cutting power attaches in an especial way to the sayings of Jesus, which pierce the heart as no other words can do, and rankle in the soul, which is quite unable to forget them. The imagery recurs in the Revelation of St. John (<a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>; <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the shadow of his hand hath he hid me</span>.

And made me a polished shaft</span>, A weapon even keener than a sword, smoothed and polished, so as to make it pierce the deeper, and kept hid in God's quiver until the time came when it could be launched with most effect against the hearts of ungodly men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The exhortation is now continued. Israel is to learn the incomparable nature of Jehovah from the work of redemption thus prepared in word and deed. The whole future depends upon the attitude which it henceforth assumes to His commandments. "Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I, Jehovah thy God, am He that teacheth thee to do that which profiteth, and leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldst go. O that thou hearkenedst to my commandments! then thy peace becomes like the river, and thy righteousness like waves of the sea; and thy seed becomes like the sand, and the children of thy body like the grains thereof: its name will not be cut off nor destroyed away from my countenance." Jehovah is Israel's rightful and right teacher and leader. &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-10.htm">Isaiah 44:10</a>, to furnish what is useful, to produce what is beneficial or profitable. The optative &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is followed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>, by the preterite utinam attenderis, the idea of reality being mixed up with the wish. Instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in the apodosis, we should expect &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; (so would), as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>. The former points out the consequence of the wish regarded as already realized. Sha&#770;lo&#772;m, prosperity or health, will thereby come upon Israel in such abundance, that it will, as it were, bathe therein; and tseda&#770;qa&#770;h, rectitude acceptable to God, so abundantly, that it, the sinful one, will be covered by it over and over again. Both of these, sha&#770;lo&#772;m and tseda&#770;qa&#770;h, are introduced here as a divine gift, not merited by Israel, but only conditional upon that faith which gives heed to the word of God, especially to the word which promises redemption, and appropriates it to itself. Another consequence of the obedience of faith is, that Israel thereby becomes a numerous and eternally enduring nation. The play upon the words in &#1499;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; is very conspicuous. Many expositors (e.g., Rashi, Gesenius, Hitzig, and Knobel) regard &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; as synonymous with &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, and therefore as signifying the viscera, i.e., the beings that fill the heart of the sea; but it is much more natural to suppose that the suffix points back to cho&#772;l. Moreover, no such metaphorical use of viscera can be pointed out; and since in other instances the feminine plural (such as kena&#770;pho&#772;th, qera&#770;no&#772;th) denotes that which is artificial as distinguished from what is natural, it is impossible to see why the interior of the sea, which is elsewhere called le&#772;bh (lebhabh, the heart), and indirectly also beten, should be called &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. To all appearance &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; signifies the grains of sand (lxx, Jerome, Targ.); and this is confirmed by the fact that &#1502;&#1506;&#1488; (Neo-Heb. &#1502;&#1506;&#1492; numulus) is the Targum word for &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, and the Semitic root &#1502;&#1506;, related to &#1502;&#1490;; &#1502;&#1511;, melted, dissolved, signifies to be soft or tender. The conditional character of the concluding promise has its truth in the word &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. Israel remains a nation even in its apostasy, but fallen under the punishment of kareth (of cutting off), under which individuals perish when they wickedly transgress the commandment of circumcision, and others of a similar kind. It is still a people, but rooted out and swept away from the gracious countenance of God, who no more acknowledges it as His own people. </body></html>
