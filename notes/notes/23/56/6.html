But there can be no doubt that this verse alludes particularly to the conversion of the Gentiles. This truth could not be told the Jewish people otherwise than by using terms taken from rites familiar to them, unless the nature of the Christian dispensation had been previously explained; a matter evidently unfit for their information, when they were yet to live so long under the Jewish law. For though the prophets speak of the little value of their regard to the ceremonial law, they easily make themselves understood, that they mean, when it was observed without the moral law; which they describe in the purity and perfection of the gospel. So admirable was this conduct, that while it hid the future dispensation it prepared men for it.” — Bishop Warburton’s <span class="ital">Div.

Spiritual blessings are unspeakably better than having sons and daughters; for children are a care, and may prove a grief and shame, but the blessings we partake of in God's house, are comforts which cannot be made bitter. Those who love the Lord truly, will serve him faithfully, and then his commandments are not grievous. Three things are promised. Assistance: I will not only bid them welcome, but incline them to come. Acceptance, and comfort: though they came mourning to the house of prayer, they shall go away rejoicing. They shall find ease by casting their cares and burdens upon God. Many a sorrowful spirit has been made joyful in the house of prayer. The Gentiles shall be one body with the Jews, that, as Christ says, Joh 10:16, there may be one fold and one Shepherd. Thanks be to God that none are separated from him except by wilful sin and unbelief; and if we come to him, we shall be accepted through the sacrifice of our great High Priest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/56.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also the sons of the stranger - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>).

Assuredly and irresistibly will the word of redemption be fulfilled. "For ye will go out with joy, and be led forth in peace: the mountains and the hills will break out before you into shouting, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. Instead of the thorn will cypresses shoot up, and instead of the fleabane will myrtles shoot up: and it will be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting memorial that will not be swept away." "With joy," i.e., without the hurry of fear (<a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>); "in peace," i.e., without having to fight their way through or flee. The idea of the sufferer falls back in &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; behind that of a festal procession (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-15.htm">Psalm 45:15-16</a>). In applying the term kaph (hand) to the trees, the prophet had in his mind their kippo&#772;th, or branches. The psalmist in <a href="/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a> transfers the figure created by our prophet to the waves of the streams. Na&#8219;a&#774;tsu&#772;ts (from na&#770;&#8219;ats, to sting) is probably no particular kind of thorn, such, for example, as the fuller's thistle, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-19.htm">Isaiah 7:19</a>, briers and thorns generally. On sirpad, see Ges. Thes.; we have followed the rendering, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;, of the lxx. That this transformation of the vegetation of the desert is not to be taken literally, any more than in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-20</a>, is evident from the shouting of the mountains, and the clapping of hands on the part of the trees. On the other hand, however, the prophet says something more than that Israel will return home with such feelings of joy as will cause everything to appear transformed. Such promises as those which we find here and in <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1-2</a>, and such exhortations as those which we find in <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-9.htm">Isaiah 52:9</a>, arise from the consciousness, which was common to both prophets and apostles, that the whole creation will one day share in the liberty and glory of the children of God (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). This thought is dressed up sometimes in one for, and sometimes in another. The psalmists after the captivity borrowed the colours in which they painted it from our prophet (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1-9</a>). &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is construed as a neuter (cf., &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>), referring to this festal transformation of the outer world on the festive return of the redeemed. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is treated in the attributive clause as a masculine, as if it came from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to make an incision, to crimp, as we have already indicated; but the Arabic a&#770;yat, shows that it comes from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, to point out, and is contracted from a&#774;wa&#774;yat, and therefore was originally a feminine. </body></html>
