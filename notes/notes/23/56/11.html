They were greedy and insatiable in that which the soul or the appetite demands. The idea here is, that the prophets to whom reference is here made were sensual, and disposed to gorge themselves; living only for carnal indulgence, insensible to the rights of others, and never satisfied.<p>And they are shepherds that cannot understand - Who are ignorant of the needs of the people, and who cannot be made to comprehend what is needed by them (see <a href="/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>).<p>They all look to their own way - That is, they are all selfish.

The charge of cupidity and of selling oracles for gain is one frequently brought against the false prophets (<a href="/micah/3-5.htm" title="Thus said the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that puts not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.">Micah 3:5</a>; <a href="/micah/3-11.htm" title="The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean on the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come on us.">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm" title="For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm" title="And will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-25.htm" title="There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 22:25</a>); a contemporary instance may be the incident of Shemaiah (<a href="/nehemiah/6-10.htm" title="Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.">Nehemiah 6:10</a> ff.). That the priesthood was infected with the same vice of covetousness is shown by <a href="/malachi/1-12.htm" title="But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.">Malachi 1:12</a>; on the upper classes generally see <a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm" title="Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, every one of his brother.

Cheyne renders “and these, pastors as they are,” taking “pastors” in the figurative sense of rulers. Dillmann with a slight change of the text reads “and even these, the shepherds,” supposing that a class of persons different from the “watchmen” (prophets) are now spoken of, viz., the nobles and elders. On any view the sentence is awkward; it adds nothing to the thought, and may originally have been a marginal gloss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they all look to their own way</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">they have all turned to their own way</span>; all pursue their selfish interests (cf. <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm" title="All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from his quarter</span>] Render, <span class="bld">without exception</span>, as <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,">Ezekiel 25:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-4.htm" title="But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:">Genesis 19:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they are greedy dogs</span>. Another defect is noted. Not only do they fail in the way of neglect of duty, but they are actively culpable. Being worldly and not spiritually minded, they are "greedy" after gain. Anciently, the taking of a gift, or fee, from those who came to consult them was regarded as no dishonour to the prophetic office (<a href="/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>); but the nobler class of prophets declined to make a profit of their spiritual powers, and would receive no fee (<a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>; <a href="/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>).
