Yahweh states what was necessary to prepare themselves for it, and what was the character which he demanded of those who were disposed to embrace its offers, and who would be admitted to its privileges.<p>Keep ye judgment - Margin, 'Equity.' Break off your sins, and be holy. A somewhat similar declaration was made by John the Baptist when he announced the coming of the Messiah: 'Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand' <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>. The general idea is, that it was not only appropriate that the prospect of his coming and his near approach should lead them to a holy life, but it was necessary in order that they might escape his indignation.<p>My salvation is near to come - It is to be borne in mind that this was regarded as addressed to the Jews in exile in Babylon, and there is probably a primary reference in the words to the deliverance which they were about to experience from their long and painful captivity. But at the same time the language is appropriate to the coming of the kingdom of God under the Messiah, and the whole scope of the passage requires us to understand it of that event. Language similar to this occurs frequently in the New Testament, where the sacred writers seem to have had this passage in their eye (see <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="/luke/21-31.htm">Luke 21:31</a>; <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-11</a>). It is to be regarded, therefore, as having a reference to the future coming of the Messiah - perhaps as designed to describe the series of deliverances which were to close the painful bondage in Babylon, and to bring the people of God to perfect freedom, and to the full fruition of his favor. Though the actual coming of the Messiah at the time of the exile was at a period comparatively remote, yet the commencement of the great work of their deliverance was near at hand. They were soon to be rescued, and this rescue was to be but the first in the train of deliverances that would result in the entire redemption of the people of God, and was to be the public pledge that all that he had promised of the redemption of the world should be certainly effected.<p>To be revealed - To be made known; to be publicly manifested. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/56.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 56<p>Isa 56:1-12.

Observe the word of the Lord, which comes from the God of judgment, is the best informer of the judgment, and the only rule of faith and practice; and which should be kept in the heart, mind, and memory, be held fast, and abode by; and so likewise all the ordinances of the Lord, which are his statutes and judgments; these should be all of them kept as they were delivered, in faith, from love, and with a view to the glory of God and Christ; all matters of judgment and justice between man and man, whether public or private, should be observed and done; all that you would have men to do to you, do to them; all works of righteousness required by the Lord, though not to be depended upon for justification in his sight, but regarded as fruits and evidences of faith and repentance; for works of righteousness cannot be done but by regenerated persons. The reasons enforcing a regard to these things follow: <p>for my salvation is near to come; which are either the words of God the Father concerning Christ and his salvation, whom he appointed, called, and sent to effect it; who, when this prophecy was given out, was to come, and was to come as a Saviour, and was near at hand; and whose salvation, as to the efficacy of it, was come, all the Old Testament saints being saved by it; and, as to the impetration of it, was near at hand, he being ready to come, and in a short time, comparatively speaking, did come, and work out this salvation God had resolved upon, chosen his people to, and in which his glory was greatly concerned; and therefore calls it his own: or they are the words of Christ, who is the sole author of spiritual and eternal salvation, and in whom alone it is, and from him alone to be had; and which was near, being performed by himself, published in his Gospel, applied by his Spirit, and enjoyed by his people here and to all eternity: <p>and my righteousness to be revealed; and which also are either the words of God the Father concerning his faithfulness in the performance of his promise of Christ, and good things by him; concerning his justice, which was glorified in the work of redemption by Christ; or concerning the righteousness of Christ, called his, because he sent him to bring it in, he approves of it, imputes it to his people, and justifies them by it; or they are the words of Christ concerning his own righteousness, which he has wrought out, and brought in, in the room and stead of his people, and for their sakes; and which is revealed, not by the light of nature, nor by the law of Moses, but by the Gospel of Christ, and that from faith to faith, or only to believers. Now these being used as arguments to engage to the keeping and doing judgment and justice, show that the doctrines of salvation by Christ, and justification by his righteousness, are no licentious doctrines. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/56.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation <i>is</i> near to come, and my <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> righteousness to be revealed.</span><p>(a) God shows what he requires of them after he has delivered them: that is, the works of charity by which true faith is declared.<p>(b) Which I will declare toward you, and pour into your hearts by my Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/56.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1, 2</span>. The exhortation to righteousness is based on the nearness of Jehovah’s salvation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/46-13.htm" title="I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.">Isaiah 46:13</a>, <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm" title="Seek you the LORD while he may be found, call you on him while he is near:">Isaiah 55:6</a>). <span class="ital">justice</span> should be <span class="bld">righteousness</span> (as in R.V.), the same word as in the last line of the verse, but in a different sense. In the first case righteousness means conformity to the law of God (cf. <a href="/isaiah/58-2.htm" title="Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.">Isaiah 58:2</a>), in the second it is, as often, equivalent to salvation. The thought that salvation is near is as characteristic of the later chapters of this book as of chs. 40–55. (see <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm" title="And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.">Isaiah 57:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm" title="Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health shall spring forth speedily: and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.">Isaiah 58:8</a> ff., <a href="/isaiah/59-15.htm" title="Yes, truth fails; and he that departs from evil makes himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.">Isaiah 59:15</a> ff., <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a> ff., <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm" title="I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: you that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,">Isaiah 62:6</a> &c.), but it is equally prominent in the post-Exilic prophecies of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. The establishment of the Jews in their own land had not realised the glorious predictions connected with it in 40–55; yet the conviction remained immoveable that the final act of redemption was at hand, and was retarded only by the sin of the people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - AN EXHORTATION TO OBSERVE THE LAW, ESPECIALLY THE LAW OF THE SABBATH, COMBINED WITH PROMISES. There was much of the Law which it was impossible to observe during the Captivity. Sacrifice had ceased, the temple was destroyed, almost all the ceremonial law must have been suspended; even the command to do no work on the sabbath day cannot have been kept by a nation of slaves, whose masters would certainly not have permitted them to be idle one day in seven. Still, the spirit of the ordinance might be kept by devoting the day, so far as was possible, to religious observance, as to prayer and to meditation upon holy things. This is now enjoined on the captive Jews, with the promise of a blessing - a blessing in which even the most despised part of the nation, the proselytes and the eunuchs, might participate. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep ye judgment, and do justice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">keep ye Law</span>, <span class="accented">and observe righteousness.</span> The exhortation is general, and has no special bearing on trials or law-courts. It is a call on the Jews, in their captivity, to keep, so far as was possible, the whole Law given on Sinai. My salvation is near to come. The nearer the time of deliverance approaches, the more faithful and exact ought Israel to be in life and conduct. God's "salvation" and his "righteousness" go hand-in-hand. It is as his righteous people, "a holy seed" (<a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>), that he is about to vindicate and rescue them. If they are no holier than others, why should he do more for them than for those others? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/55.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The appeal, to leave their own way and their own thoughts, and yield themselves to God the Redeemer, and to His word, is now urged on the ground of the heaven-wide difference between the ways and thoughts of this God and the despairing thoughts of men (<a href="/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>), and their aimless labyrinthine ways. "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah: no, heaven is high above the earth; so high are my ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts." The k&#305;&#772; (imo) introduces the undeniable statement of a fact patent to the senses, for the purpose of clearly setting forth, by way of comparison, the relation in which the ways and thoughts of God stand to those of man.
