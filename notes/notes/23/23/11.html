Tyre exceeded Zidon in this respect, as Strabo testifies, and sent forth colonies into Africa and Spain, unto and beyond the pillars of Hercules: and Quintus Curtius says that her colonies were diffused almost over the whole world. The Tyrians, therefore, having planted colonies at Tarshish, and upon the coasts of Chittim, it was natural for them, when they were pressed with dangers and difficulties at home, to flee to their friends and countrymen abroad for protection. That they really did so, St. Jerome asserts, upon the authority of Assyrian histories, which are now lost. But,” it is here foretold, that, “though they should pass over to Chittim, yet even there they should find no quiet settlement; <span class="ital">There also shalt thou have no rest </span>— Megasthenes (an historian who lived about 300 years before Christ) is quoted by several ancient authors, for saying that Nebuchadnezzar subdued a great part of Africa and Spain, and proceeded as far as the pillars of Hercules. After he had subdued Tyre and Egypt, we may suppose he carried his arms further westward; and if he proceeded as far as Megasthenes reports, the Tyrians might well be said to <span class="ital">have no rest, </span>their conqueror pursuing them from one country to another. But besides this, and after this, the Carthaginians, and other colonies of the Tyrians, lived in a very unsettled state. Their history is made up of little but wars and tumults, even before their three fatal wars with the Romans, in every one of which their affairs grew worse and worse. Sicily and Spain, Europe and Africa, the land, and their own element, the sea, were theatres of their calamities and miseries; till, at last, not only the new, but old Carthage too, was utterly destroyed. As the Carthaginians sprung from the Tyrians, and the Tyrians from the Zidonians, and Zidon was the firstborn of Canaan, (<a href="/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15</a>,) so the curse upon Canaan seems to have pursued them to the most distant parts of the earth.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory.

To stretch out the hand is indicative of punishment (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>), and means that God has resolved to inflict exemplary punishment on Tyre and its dependent colonies.<p>Over the sea - That is, over the sea coast of Phenicia; or over the cities that were built on the coast.

That is, the Lord of hosts, who had purposed to destroy Tyre, stretched out his hand of power over it, called the sea, as in <a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a> because situated in it, supported by it, and had the sovereignty of it; in like manner as he stretched out his hand on the Red Sea, and destroyed Pharaoh and the Egyptians in it; to which the allusion may be: <p>he shook the kingdoms; of Tyre and Zidon, which were both kingdoms, and distinct ones; and also made other neighbouring kingdoms shake and tremble when these fell, fearing it would be their case next. Some understand this of the moving of Nebuchadnezzar, and of the kings of the provinces under him, to come against Tyre: <p>the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city; the city of Tyre, so famous for merchandise, that it was the mart of nations, as in <a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a> or "against Canaan", in which country Tyre and Zidon were, being originally built and inhabited by the posterity of Canaan, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>, <p>to destroy the strong holds thereof; either of the merchant city Tyre, whose fortifications were strong, both by nature and art; or "of Canaan", whose strong holds, or fortified cities, the principal of them were Tyre and Zidon; so Jarchi: and if the Lord of hosts gives a commandment to destroy it and its strong holds, as he did to Nebuchadnezzar and his army, and afterwards to Alexander and his, who could save them? that is, God said it, who gave commandment to destroy it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">He stretched out his hand, &c.</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">he hath stretched out … hath shaken</span>.

The sea, or more closely considered, the fortress of the sea, i.e., the rock-island on which Neo-tyrus stood with its strong and lofty houses, lifts up its voice in lamentation. Sidon, the ancestress of Canaan, must hear with overwhelming shame how Tyre mourns the loss of her daughters, and complains that, robbed as she has been of her children, she is like a barren women. For the war to have murdered her young men and maidens, was exactly the same as if she had never given birth to them or brought them up. Who is there that does not recognise in this the language of Isaiah (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>)? - Even in Egypt the fate of Phoenicia produces alarm. <a href="/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a> "When the report cometh to Egypt, they tremble at the report from Tzor." In the protasis (<a href="/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>) lemitzraim (to Egypt) the verb "cometh" is implied; the Caph in <a href="/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a> signifies simultaneousness, as in <a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a> (Ges. Thes. p. 650). The news of the fall of Tyre spreads universal terror in Egypt, because its own prosperity depended upon Tyre, which was the great market for its corn; and when such a bulwark had fallen, a similar fate awaited itself. </body></html>
