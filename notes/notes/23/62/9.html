Nothing is a more certain indication of liberty and prosperity than this - that every man may securely enjoy the avails of his own labor. Nothing more certainly marks the advance of civilization, and nothing so much tends to encourage industry and to promote prosperity. When a man has no security that what he sows shall be reaped by himself; when there is danger that it will be destroyed or consumed by foreign invaders; or, when it is liable to be taken by arbitrary power to minister to the needs and luxuries of the great, there will be no industry, no incitement to labor. Such is the condition always in war. Such is the condition now in the Turkish dominions; and such is the state in savage life, and in all uncivilized communities. And as the tendency of true religion is to repress wars, to establish order, and to diffuse just views of the rights of man, it everywhere promotes prosperity by furnishing security that a man shall enjoy the avails of his own productive industry. Wherever the Christian religion prevails in its purity, there is seen the fulfillment of this prophecy; and the extension of that religion everywhere would promote universal industry, order, and law.<p>And praise the Lord - They shall not consume it on their lusts, nor shall they partake of it without gratitude.

The idea is, that the effect of true religion would be to produce security and liberty, and to make people feel that all their blessings came from God; to partake of them with gratitude, and to make them the occasion of praise and thanksgiving. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/62.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. eat &#8230; and praise&#8212;not consume it on their own lusts, and without thanksgiving.<p>drink it in &#8230; courts&#8212;They who have gathered the vintage shall drink it at the feasts held in the courts surrounding the temple (De 12:17, 18; 14:23, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They that have gathered it, </span> i.e. the wine mentioned in the former verse, that have brought it from their several vineyards, and laid it in their cellars, every one shall eat the fruit of his own labours; thou shalt not sow, and another reap, as formerly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And praise the Lord; </span> they themselves shall praise him, viz. for his bounty and goodness; and others also that shall be partakers with them; <span class="ital">God will be bountiful</span>, and they shall be thankful.

This is not to be understood literally, at any rate, of the whole produce of the laud.

Having given himself up to praying to Jehovah and preaching to the people, he will not rest or hold his peace till the salvation, which has begun to be realized, has been brought fully out to the light of day. It is, however, really Jehovah who commences thus: "For Zion's sake I shall not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I shall not rest, till her righteousness breaks forth like morning brightness, and her salvation like a blazing torch. And nations will see they righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and men will call thee by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will determine. And thou wilt be an adorning coronet in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the lap of thy God." It is evident that Jehovah is the speaker here, both from <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a> and also from the expression used; for cha&#770;sha&#770;h is the word commonly employed in such utterances of Jehovah concerning Himself, to denote His leaving things in their existing state without interposing (<a href="/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-11.htm">Isaiah 64:11</a>). Moreover, the arguments which may be adduced to prove that the author of chapters 40-66 is not the speaker in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-11</a>, also prove that it is not he who is continuing to speak of himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-12</a> Jehovah, having now begun to speak and move on behalf of Zion, will "for Zion's sake," i.e., just because it is Zion, His own church, neither be silent nor give Himself rest, till He has gloriously executed His work of grace. Zion is now in the shade, but the time will come when her righteousness will go forth as no&#772;gah, the light which bursts through the night (<a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-9.htm">Isaiah 59:9</a>; here the morning sunlight, <a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; compare shachar, the morning red, <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>); or till her salvation is like a torch which blazes. &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; belongs to &#1499;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (mercha) in the form of an attributive clause  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, although it might also be assumed that &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; stands by attraction for &#1514;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; (cf., <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; Ewald, 317, c). The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, which is generally applied to wrath (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), is here used in connection with salvation, which has wrath towards the enemies of Zion as its obverse side: Zion's tsedeq (righteousness) shall become like the morning sunlight, before which even the last twilight has vanished; and Zion's yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h is like a nightly torch, which sets fire to its own material, and everything that comes near it. The force of the conjunction &#1506;&#1491; (until) does not extend beyond <a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>. From <a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a> onwards, the condition of things in the object indicated by &#1506;&#1491; is more fully described. The eyes of the nations will be directed to the righteousness of Zion, the impress of which is now their common property; the eyes of all kings to her glory, with which the glory of none of them, nor even of all together, can possibly compare. And because this state of Zion is a new one, which has never existed before, her old name is not sufficient to indicate her nature. She is called by a new name; and who could determine this new name? He who makes the church righteous and glorious, He, and He alone, is able to utter a name answering to her new nature, just as it was He who called Abram Abraham, and Jacob Israel. The mouth of Jehovah will determine it (&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;, to pierce, to mark, to designate in a signal and distinguishing manner, nuncupare; cf., <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17</a>). It is only in imagery that prophecy here sees what Zion will be in the future: she will be "a crown of glory," "a diadem," or rather a tiara (tsen&#305;&#772;ph; Chethib tsenu&#772;ph  equals  mitsnepheth, the head-dress of the high priest, <a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-5.htm">Zechariah 3:5</a>; and that of the king, <a href="/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a>) "of regal dignity," in the hand of her God (for want of a synonym of "hand," we have adopted the rendering "in the lap" the second time that it occurs). Meier renders &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1507;) Jovae sub praesidio, as though it did not form part of the figure. But it is a main feature in the figure, that Jehovah holds the crown in His hand. Zion is not the ancient crown which the Eternal wears upon His head, but the crown wrought out in time, which He holds in His hand, because He is seen in Zion by all creation. The whole history of salvation is the history of the taking of the kingdom, and the perfecting of the kingdom by Jehovah; in other words, the history of the working out of this crown. </body></html>
