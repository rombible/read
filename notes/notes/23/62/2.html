What the Gentiles are especially to see and admire is Israel's righteousness. This may point to those acknowledgments of the purity and excellence of the early Church which were made by the heathen (Plin., 'Epist.,' 10:97), and which culminated in the saying, "See how these Christians love one another!" The sceptic Gibbon acknowledges, among the causes of the success of Christianity, "the virtues of the early Christians." All kings (comp. <a href="/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7, 23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>:11). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called by a new name</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 12; and see also <a href="/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>). It is not altogether clear what the "new name" is, since in the remainder of the present chapter more than one name is suggested. Rosenmuller supposes" Hephzibah" to be meant. Dr. Kay suggests "the holy people," and notes that the title of "holy ones," or "saints," is given by St. Paul to all Christians (<a href="/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>; <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>, etc.). Mr. Cheyne thinks that it is some unknown title of honour, akin to that mentioned by Jeremiah "Jehovah our Righteousness" (<a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>). "New names" will be given to individual saints in the heavenly kingdom (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/61.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The shame of banishment will then be changed into an excess of joy, and honourable distinction. "Instead of shame ye will have double, and (instead) of insult they rejoice at their portion: thus in their land they will possess double; everlasting joy will they have. For I Jehovah love right, hate robbery in wickedness; and give them their reward in faithfulness, and conclude an everlasting covenant with them. And their family will be known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the nations: all who see them will recognise them, for they are a family that Jehovah hath blessed." The enigmatical first half of <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>, where mishneh is shown to consist of double possession in the land of their inheritance, which has not only been restored to them, but extended far beyond the borders of their former possession; and ya&#770;ro&#772;nnu&#772; chelqa&#770;m (cf., <a href="/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>) denotes excessive rejoicing in the ground and soil belonging to them (according to the appointment of Jehovah): chelqa&#770;m as in <a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; and mishneh as equivalent not to &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, but to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. Taking this to be the relation between <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, the meaning of la&#770;khe&#772;n is not, "therefore, because they have hitherto suffered shame and reproach;" but what is promised in <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is unfolded according to its practical results, the effects consequent upon its fulfilment being placed in the foreground; so that there is less to astonish us in the elliptically brief form of <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> which needed explanation. The transition from the form of address to that of declaration is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14-15</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is a concise expression for &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, just as &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a> is for &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;. Chelqa&#770;m is either the accusative of the object, according to the construction of &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, which occurs in <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; or what I prefer, looking at &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, and &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>, an adverbial accusative  equals  &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1501;. The lxx, Jerome, and Saad. render the clause, in opposition to the accents, "instead of your double shame and reproach;" but in that case the principal words of the clause would read &#1492;&#1500;&#1511;&#1499;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The explanation adopted by the Targum, Saad., and Jerome, "shame on the part of those who rejoice in their portion," is absolutely impossible. The great majority of the modern commentators adopt essentially the same explanation of <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> as we have done, and even A. E. Kimchi does the same. Hahn's modification, "instead of your shame is the double their portion, and (instead) of the insult this, that they will rejoice," forces a meaning upon the syntax which is absolutely impossible. The reason for the gracious recompense for the wrong endured is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>, "Jehovah loves the right," which the enemies of Israel have so shamefully abused. "He hates &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1490;&#1494;&#1500;, i.e., not rapinam in holocausto (as Jerome, Talmud b. Succa 30a, Luther, and others render it; Eng. ver. "robbery for burnt-offering") - for what object would there be in mentioning sacrifices here, seeing that only heathen sacrifices could be intended, and there would be something worse than ga&#770;ze&#772;l to condemn in them? - but robbery, or, strictly speaking, "something robbed in or with knavery" (lxx, Targ., Syr., Saad.), which calls to mind at once the cruel robbery or spoiling that Israel had sustained from the Chaldeans, its bo&#772;zez&#305;&#772;m (<a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>) - a robbery which passed all bounds. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is softened from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;), like &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a> and <a href="/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>; though it is doubtful whether the punctuation assumes the latter, as the Targum does, and not rather the meaning holocaustum supported by the Talmud. For the very reason, therefore, that Israel had been so grievously ill-treated by the instruments of punishment employed by Jehovah, He would give those who had been ill-treated their due reward, after He had made the evil, which He had not approved, subservient to His own salutary purposes. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the reward of work in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, of hardship in <a href="/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>; here it is the reward of suffering. This reward He would give &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, exactly as He had promised, without the slightest deduction. The posterity of those who have been ill-treated and insulted will be honourably known (&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>) in the world of nations, and men will need only to catch sight of them to recognise them (by prominent marks of blessing), for they are a family blessed of God. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, not quod (because), although it might have this meaning, but nam (for), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>, since hikk&#305;&#772;r includes the meaning agnoscere (to recognise). </body></html>
