This must relate to some happier condition than the Jews enjoyed after their return from captivity, when their enemies frequently invaded them, and, at last, the Romans destroyed both their temple and nation.” — Lowth. The passage is undoubtedly metaphorical; and is to be understood of the free and undisturbed enjoyment of the spiritual blessings of religion, which God will grant the Christian Church in the latter days: and “the oath which ushers in this promise proves that it will be exactly and punctually performed.” See <a href="/joel/2-24.htm" title="And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.">Joel 2:24</a>; and <a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm" title="Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-17.htm" title="For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.">Zechariah 9:17</a>.

It was usually done by lifting up the hand toward beaten and appealing to God. As God could swear by no greater <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, he is represented as swearing by himself (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>). Here he is represented as swearing by his right hand and by his arm - the strong instrument by which he would accomplish his purposes to defend and save his people. The sense is, that he solemnly pledged the strength of his arm to deliver them, and restore them to their own land.<p>Surely I will no more give - Margin, as in Hebrew, 'If I give.' That is, I will not give.<p>Thy corn to be meat - The word 'corn' in the Scriptures means all kinds of grain - especially wheat, barley, etc. The word 'meat' was formerly used to denote all kinds of food, and was not restricted as it is now usually to animal food.

In answer to the representations of the "remembrancers," God solemnly binds himself by an oath to come to the relief of the people, to restore them to their own land, and to give them the enjoyment of its fruits in peace. <span class="cmt_word">By his right hand</span>. God commonly swears "by himself" (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>), or "by his holiness" (<a href="/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>; <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). Once he swears "by his great Name" (<a href="/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>), and once "by the excellency of Jacob" (<a href="/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>). There is no other place in Scripture where he swears "by his right hand and arm" - emblems of his power to act. <span class="cmt_word">Thy corn...  thy wine;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of thy land. Hitherto, even when Israel was in possession of Palestine, its fruits were constantly destroyed, or carried off, by the raids of hostile neighbours. Henceforth this plundering should cease. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/62.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nearly all the more recent commentators regard the prophet himself as speaking here. Having given himself up to praying to Jehovah and preaching to the people, he will not rest or hold his peace till the salvation, which has begun to be realized, has been brought fully out to the light of day. It is, however, really Jehovah who commences thus: "For Zion's sake I shall not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I shall not rest, till her righteousness breaks forth like morning brightness, and her salvation like a blazing torch. And nations will see they righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and men will call thee by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will determine. And thou wilt be an adorning coronet in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the lap of thy God." It is evident that Jehovah is the speaker here, both from <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a> and also from the expression used; for cha&#770;sha&#770;h is the word commonly employed in such utterances of Jehovah concerning Himself, to denote His leaving things in their existing state without interposing (<a href="/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-11.htm">Isaiah 64:11</a>). Moreover, the arguments which may be adduced to prove that the author of chapters 40-66 is not the speaker in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-11</a>, also prove that it is not he who is continuing to speak of himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-12</a> Jehovah, having now begun to speak and move on behalf of Zion, will "for Zion's sake," i.e., just because it is Zion, His own church, neither be silent nor give Himself rest, till He has gloriously executed His work of grace. Zion is now in the shade, but the time will come when her righteousness will go forth as no&#772;gah, the light which bursts through the night (<a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-9.htm">Isaiah 59:9</a>; here the morning sunlight, <a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; compare shachar, the morning red, <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>); or till her salvation is like a torch which blazes. &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; belongs to &#1499;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (mercha) in the form of an attributive clause  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, although it might also be assumed that &#1497;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; stands by attraction for &#1514;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; (cf., <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; Ewald, 317, c). The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, which is generally applied to wrath (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), is here used in connection with salvation, which has wrath towards the enemies of Zion as its obverse side: Zion's tsedeq (righteousness) shall become like the morning sunlight, before which even the last twilight has vanished; and Zion's yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h is like a nightly torch, which sets fire to its own material, and everything that comes near it. The force of the conjunction &#1506;&#1491; (until) does not extend beyond <a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>. From <a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a> onwards, the condition of things in the object indicated by &#1506;&#1491; is more fully described. The eyes of the nations will be directed to the righteousness of Zion, the impress of which is now their common property; the eyes of all kings to her glory, with which the glory of none of them, nor even of all together, can possibly compare. And because this state of Zion is a new one, which has never existed before, her old name is not sufficient to indicate her nature. She is called by a new name; and who could determine this new name? He who makes the church righteous and glorious, He, and He alone, is able to utter a name answering to her new nature, just as it was He who called Abram Abraham, and Jacob Israel. The mouth of Jehovah will determine it (&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;, to pierce, to mark, to designate in a signal and distinguishing manner, nuncupare; cf., <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17</a>). It is only in imagery that prophecy here sees what Zion will be in the future: she will be "a crown of glory," "a diadem," or rather a tiara (tsen&#305;&#772;ph; Chethib tsenu&#772;ph  equals  mitsnepheth, the head-dress of the high priest, <a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-5.htm">Zechariah 3:5</a>; and that of the king, <a href="/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a>) "of regal dignity," in the hand of her God (for want of a synonym of "hand," we have adopted the rendering "in the lap" the second time that it occurs). Meier renders &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1507;) Jovae sub praesidio, as though it did not form part of the figure. But it is a main feature in the figure, that Jehovah holds the crown in His hand. Zion is not the ancient crown which the Eternal wears upon His head, but the crown wrought out in time, which He holds in His hand, because He is seen in Zion by all creation. The whole history of salvation is the history of the taking of the kingdom, and the perfecting of the kingdom by Jehovah; in other words, the history of the working out of this crown. </body></html>
