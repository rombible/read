How foolishly drunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan; and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates, and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of being undone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God's professing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And he is just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they were proud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soon as discovered, is plucked and eaten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one - The Hebrew of this passage is, 'Lo! there is to the Lord (&#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  la'dona&#772;y) mighty and strong.' Lowth renders it,<p>'Behold the mighty one, the exceedingly strong one,'<p>And supposes that it means the Lord himself. It is evident, however, that something must be understood as being that which the Lord 'hath,' for the Hebrew properly implies that there is something strong and mighty which is under his control, and with which, as with a tempest, he will sweep away and destroy Ephraim. Jarchi supposes that &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach ("wind") is understood; Kimchi thinks that the word is &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  yo&#770;m ("day"); others believe that &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  chayil ("an army") is understood. But I think the obvious interpretation is to refer it to the Assyrian king, as the agent by which Yahweh would destroy Samaria <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>. This power was entirely under the direction of Yahweh, and would be employed by him in accomplishing his purpose on that guilty people (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>As a tempest of hail - A storm of hail is a most striking representation of the desolation that is produced by the ravages of an invading army (compare <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>; the note at <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; also <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>A flood of mighty waters - This is also a striking description of the devastating effects of an invading army (compare <a href="/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>)<p>Shall cast down to the earth - To cast it to the earth means that it should be entirely humbled and destroyed (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>).<p>With the hand - Septuagint: &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  bia - 'Force,' 'violence.'

In the present ease the "mighty and strong one" is the Assyrian power. <span class="cmt_word">As a tempest of hail,</span> etc. The fearfully devastating force of an Assyrian invasion is set forth under three distinct images - a hailstorm, a furious tempest of wind, and a violent inundation - as though so only could its full horror be depicted. War is always a horrible scourge; but in ancient times, and with a people so cruel as the Assyrians, it was a calamity exceeding in terribleness the utmost that the modern reader can conceive. It involved the wholesale burning of cities and villages, the wanton destruction of trees and crops, the slaughter of thousands in battles and sieges, the subsequent massacre of hundreds in cold blood, the plunder of all classes, and the deportation of tens of thousands of captives, who were carried into hopeless servitude in a strange land. <span class="cmt_word">With the hand</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with force," "violently." So in Assyrian constantly (compare the use of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He was angry, but not without love; He punished, but only to be able to pardon again. "Therefore will the guilt of Jacob be purged thus: and this is all the fruit of the removal of his son: when He maketh all altar-stones like chalk-stones that are broken in pieces, Astarte images and sun-pillars do not rise up again." With the word "therefore" (la&#770;ce&#772;n) a conclusion is drawn from the expression "by measure." God punished Israel "by measure;" His punishment is a way to salvation: therefore it ceases as soon as its purpose is secured; and so would it cease now, if Israel would thoroughly renounce its sin, and, above all, the sin of all sins, namely idolatry. "Thus" (by this) refers to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; which follows; "by this," namely the breaking to pieces of the altars and images of the moon goddess; or possibly, to speak more correctly, the goddess of the morning-star, and those of the sun-god as well (see <a href="/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>). By the fact that Israel put away the fundamental cause of all mischief, viz., idolatry, the guilt for which it had yet to make atonement would be covered, made good, or wiped away (on cuppar, see at <a href="/isaiah/22-14.htm">Isaiah 22:14</a>). The parenthesis (cf., <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>) affirms that this very consequence would be all the fruit (co&#774;l-peri) desired by Jehovah of the removal of the sin of Israel, which the chastisement was intended to effect. </body></html>
