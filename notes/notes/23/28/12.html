Rather had he pointed the way to a time of repentance, and therefore of rest and refreshment. But to this also they closed their ears. They had but one formula of derision, whatever might be the subject of the prophet’s teaching; and the prophet, with all the scorn of irony, repeats that formula in the words that follow.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:5-15 The prophet next turns to Judah, whom he calls the residue of his people. Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom he said - To whom God had said; that is, to the Jews.

But spiritually, the "rest" meant is that to be found in obeying those very "precepts" of God (Isa 28:10) which they jeered at (compare Jer 6:16; Mt 11:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To whom he said, </span> to which people the Lord, by his minister, said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This, </span> this doctrine or precept, as it is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm" title="Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.">Isaiah 28:9</a>,10</span>, or the word of the Lord, as it follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/28-13.htm" title="But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.">Isaiah 28:13</a></span>, is the rest; the only way, in the observation of which you will find rest and satisfaction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cause the weary to rest, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">cause the weary</span> (understand either soul or country) rest.

The verse reproduces the tenor and aim of all Isaiah’s teaching (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a></span>; ch. <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a>). He had sought to point out the true way of rest for the exhausted nation by abstinence from the spirited foreign policy advocated by the anti-Assyrian faction. Two translations, however, are possible. Either: “This (Jerusalem) is the resting-place; give rest to the weary; and this is the place of refreshment”; or: <span class="bld">This</span> (<span class="bld">line of action</span>) <span class="bld">is the</span> (<span class="bld">true</span>) <span class="bld">rest … and this is the</span> (<span class="bld">true</span>) <span class="bld">refreshment</span>. The latter seems preferable. The word for “rest” (usually “resting-place”) is used in the same sense as here in <a href="/2_samuel/14-17.htm" title="Then your handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you.">2 Samuel 14:17</a>. “The weary” is the ordinary plebeian, who had everything to lose and nothing to gain, by the chances of war.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom he said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because he said to them</span>. God had from remote times offered to his people "rest" and "refreshing" - or a life of ease and peace in Palestine - but on condition of their serving him faithfully and observing his Laws (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). But they had re-jeered this "rest," since they had refused to observe the condition on which it was pro-raised. <span class="accented">Because</span> they had thus acted, God now brought upon them war and a conqueror. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The threat is now followed by a promise. This is essentially the same in character as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>. The place of the false glory thus overthrown is now filled by a glory that is divine and true. "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be the adorning crown and the splendid diadem to the remnant of His people; and the spirit of justice to them that sit on the judgment-seat, and heroic strength to them that drive back war at the gate." "The remnant of His people" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; with a fixed kametz, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>) is not Judah, as distinguished from Ephraim that had utterly perished; but Judah and the remaining portion of Ephraim, as distinguished from the portion which had perished. After the perishable thin in which they gloried had been swept away, the eternal person of Jehovah Himself would be the ornament and pride of His people. He, the Lord of the seven spirits (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), would be to this remnant of His people the spirit of right and heroic strength. There would be an end to unjust judging and powerless submission. The judges are called "those who sit &#8219;al-hammishpa&#770;t" in the sense of "on the seat of judgment" (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-5.htm">Psalm 122:5</a>); the warriors are called "those who press back milcha&#770;ma&#770;h sha&#770;&#8219;ra&#770;h" (war at the gate), i.e., either war that has reached their own gate (<a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a>), or war which they drive back as far as the gate of the enemy (<a href="/2_samuel/11-23.htm">2 Samuel 11:23</a>; 1 Macc. 5:22). The promise in this last passage corresponds to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4-5</a>. The athnach in <a href="/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a> ought to stand at hammishpa&#770;t; the second clause of the v. may be completed from the first, &#1493;&#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; being equivalent to &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; to &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1489;&#1497;. We might regard <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a> as a fulfilment of what is predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>, if the feast of passover there described really fell in the age succeeding the fall of Samaria; for this feast of passover did furnish a representation and awaken a consciousness of that national unity which had been interrupted from the time of Rehoboam. But if we read the account in the Chronicles with unprejudiced minds, it is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that this feast of passover took place in the second month of the first year of Hezekiah's reign, and therefore not after the depopulation of the northern kingdom by Shalmanassar, but after the previous and partial depopulation by Tiglath-pileser. In fact, the fulfilment cannot be looked for at all in the space between the sixth and fourteenth years of Hezekiah, since the condition of Judah during that time does not answer at all to the promises given above. The prophet here foretells what might be hoped for, when Asshur had not only humbled Ephraim, but Judah also. The address consists of two connected halves, the promising beginnings of which point to one and the same future, and lay hold of one another. </body></html>
