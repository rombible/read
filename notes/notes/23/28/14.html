You depend on your vain idols, or on your riches, or strength, or crafty devices, which will all fail you.

Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore ... - This verse commences a direct address to the scoffing and scornful nation, which is continued to the close of <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>.

It agrees best with the rulers of the Jewish people in the times of Christ, who mocked at him and his ministry, and that of his apostles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">ye scornful men</span>] Better: <span class="bld">scoffing men</span>. The “scoffer” (<span class="ital">lêç</span>, a word almost confined to Pss. and Prov.) represents the last degree of ungodliness,—open contempt of religion. The phrase here is applied to worldly politicians, who form their plans in defiance of Jehovah’s revealed will (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a></span>; ch. <a href="/isaiah/29-20.htm" title="For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:">Isaiah 29:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that rule this people</span>] The prophet’s antagonists are the party which has gained the upper hand in the councils of state; the king himself is tacitly acquitted of responsibility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15</span> is the protasis to <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a></span> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Because ye have said</span>] Isaiah no doubt clothes the thoughts of the conspirators in his own language; but the vagueness of the allusions corresponds to the air of mystery which shrouded their designs. The utmost secrecy was observed with regard to the negotiations with Egypt (ch. <a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm" title="Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?">Isaiah 29:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm" title="Woe to the rebellious children, said the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:">Isaiah 30:1</a>), and it is doubtful if at this time Isaiah knew exactly what project was on foot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with hell are we at agreement</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">with Sheôl we have made a vision</span>. The simplest explanation of this and the preceding expression is that the political plot had been ratified by a compact with the dreaded powers of the underworld. That those who had renounced the guidance of Jehovah should have recourse to necromancy and other superstitions was natural (ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>). At the same time the phrases may be proverbial, or they may merely express Isaiah’s abhorrence of the dark immorality which marked the proceedings. In any case the feeling attributed to the schemers is one of absolute security against the worst that fate could bring.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the overflowing scourge</span>]—a mixture of metaphors, which is still further increased in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/28-18.htm" title="And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.">Isaiah 28:18</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we have made lies our refuge</span>] The reference might be to conscious political treachery (towards Assyria), but more probably it is to false grounds of confidence, such as false oracles (<a href="/context/ezekiel/13-6.htm" title="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word....">Ezekiel 13:6-8</a>; <a href="/micah/2-11.htm" title="If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.">Micah 2:11</a>), Isaiah putting his own language into their mouth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">14–22</span>. There is again a <span class="ital">literary</span> connexion with what precedes; although the passage is probably a summary of an independent discourse. The prophet’s aim is to impress on his opponents the disastrous consequences of persisting in their scoffing attitude towards himself and his message.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-22.</span> - THE REBUKE OF JUDAH'S NOBLES. The power of the nobles under the later Jewish monarchy is very apparent throughout Isaiah's prophecy. It is they, and not the king, who are always blamed for bad government (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12-15</a>, etc.) or errors of policy (<a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15, 16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15-19</a>, etc.). Isaiah now turns from a denunciation of the priests and prophets, who especially opposed his teaching, to a threatening of the great men who guided the course of public affairs. He taxes them with being "men of scorn" (ver. 14), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> scorners of Jehovah, and with" a proud and insolent self-confidence" (Delitzsch). They have made, or are about to make, secret arrangements which will, they believe, secure Judaea against suffering injury at the hands of the Assyrians, and are quite satisfied with what they have done, and fear no evil. Isaiah is instructed that their boasted arrangements will entirely fail in the time of trial - their "refuge" (Egypt) will be found a refuge of lies (ver. 17), and the "overflowing scourge" (Assyria) will pass through the land, and carry all before it (ver. 18). There will then ensue a time of "vexation" and discomfort (vers. 19, 20) - God's anger will be poured out upon the land in strange ways (ver. 21). He therefore warns the rulers to lay aside their scorn of God, and humble themselves, lest a worse thing happen to them (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye scornful men</span>; literally, ye <span class="accented">men of scorn</span>. The word used is rare, but will be found in the same sense in <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a> and Proverbs 29:8. A cognate participle occurs in <a href="/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That rule this people</span>. (On the authority of the nobles at this period, see the introductory paragraph.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the words, "and they also," the prophet commences the second half of the address, and passes from Ephraim to Judah. "And they also reel with wine, and are giddy with meth; priest and prophet reel with meth, are swallowed up by wine: they are giddy with meth, reel when seeing visions, stagger when pronouncing judgment. For all tables are full of filthy vomit, without any more place." The Judaeans are not less overcome with wine than the Ephraimites, and especially the rulers of Judah. In wicked violation of the law of God, which prohibited the priests from drinking strong drink when performing priestly service, and that on pain of death (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>, cf., <a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>), they were intoxicated even in the midst of their prophetic visions (&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, literally "the thing seeing," then the act of seeing; equivalent to &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, like &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; Olshausen, 176, c), and when passing judicial sentences. In the same way Micah also charges the prophets and priests with being drunkards (<a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>., cf., <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>). Isaiah's indignation is manifested in the fact, that in the words which he uses he imitates the staggering and stumbling of the topers; like the well-known passage, Sta pes sta mi pes stas pes ne labere mi pes. Observe, for example, the threefold repetition of sha&#770;gu - ta&#770;ghu, sha&#770;gu - ta&#770;ghu, sha&#770;gu - pa&#770;qu. The hereditary priests and the four prophets represent the whole of the official personages. The preterites imply that drunkenness had become the fixed habit of the holders of these offices. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; indicates the cause ("through," as in <a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a> and <a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>), and min the effect proceeding from the cause (in consequence of wine). In v. 8 we can hear them vomit. We have the same combination of the and &#1510; in the verb kotzen, Gothic kozan. All the tables of the carousal are full, without there being any further room (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>); everything swims with vomit. The prophet paints from nature, here without idealizing. He receives their conduct as it were in a mirror, and then in the severest tones holds up this mirror before them, adults though they were. </body></html>
