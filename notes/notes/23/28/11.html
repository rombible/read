Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - This verse is to be understood as a response to what the complaining and dissatisfied people had said, as expressed in the previous verse. God says that he will teach them, but it should be by another tongue - a foreign language in a distant land. Since they refused to hearken to the messages which he sent to them, and which they regarded as adapted only to children, he would teach them in a manner that should be "much more" humiliating; he would make use of the barbarous language of foreigners to bring them to the true knowledge of God.<p>With stammering lips - The word which is used here is derived from a verb (&#1500;&#1506;&#1490;  la&#770;&#8219;a&#770;g), which means to speak unintelligibly: especially to speak in a foreign language, or to stammer; and then to mock, deride, laugh at, scorn (compare <a href="/isaiah/33-19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-9.htm">Psalm 59:9</a>; <a href="/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>). Here it means in a foreign or barbarous tongue; and the sense is, that the lessons which God wished to teach would be conveyed to them through the language of foreigners - the Chaldeans. They should be removed to a distant land, and there, in hearing a strange speech, in living long among foreigners, they should learn the lesson which they refused to do when addressed by the prophets in their own land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

This is essentially the same in character as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>. The place of the false glory thus overthrown is now filled by a glory that is divine and true. "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be the adorning crown and the splendid diadem to the remnant of His people; and the spirit of justice to them that sit on the judgment-seat, and heroic strength to them that drive back war at the gate." "The remnant of His people" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; with a fixed kametz, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>) is not Judah, as distinguished from Ephraim that had utterly perished; but Judah and the remaining portion of Ephraim, as distinguished from the portion which had perished. After the perishable thin in which they gloried had been swept away, the eternal person of Jehovah Himself would be the ornament and pride of His people. He, the Lord of the seven spirits (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), would be to this remnant of His people the spirit of right and heroic strength. There would be an end to unjust judging and powerless submission. The judges are called "those who sit &#8219;al-hammishpa&#770;t" in the sense of "on the seat of judgment" (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-5.htm">Psalm 122:5</a>); the warriors are called "those who press back milcha&#770;ma&#770;h sha&#770;&#8219;ra&#770;h" (war at the gate), i.e., either war that has reached their own gate (<a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a>), or war which they drive back as far as the gate of the enemy (<a href="/2_samuel/11-23.htm">2 Samuel 11:23</a>; 1 Macc. 5:22). The promise in this last passage corresponds to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4-5</a>. The athnach in <a href="/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a> ought to stand at hammishpa&#770;t; the second clause of the v. may be completed from the first, &#1493;&#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; being equivalent to &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; to &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1489;&#1497;. We might regard <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a> as a fulfilment of what is predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>, if the feast of passover there described really fell in the age succeeding the fall of Samaria; for this feast of passover did furnish a representation and awaken a consciousness of that national unity which had been interrupted from the time of Rehoboam. But if we read the account in the Chronicles with unprejudiced minds, it is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that this feast of passover took place in the second month of the first year of Hezekiah's reign, and therefore not after the depopulation of the northern kingdom by Shalmanassar, but after the previous and partial depopulation by Tiglath-pileser. In fact, the fulfilment cannot be looked for at all in the space between the sixth and fourteenth years of Hezekiah, since the condition of Judah during that time does not answer at all to the promises given above. The prophet here foretells what might be hoped for, when Asshur had not only humbled Ephraim, but Judah also. The address consists of two connected halves, the promising beginnings of which point to one and the same future, and lay hold of one another. </body></html>
