The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time.

The final winding up of the controversy between God and all enemies of Him and His people is also foreshadowed (Isa 61:2; 63:4; 66:14-16; Mal 4:1, 3; 2Th 1:7, 8, 9; Re 11:18; 18:20; 19:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is the time which God hath long since appointed and fixed, to avenge the cause of his oppressed and persecuted people against all their enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance,....

In all three places the "day" of God's vengeance is contrasted with the "year" of his recompense, to show how infinite is his mercy, how short-lived, comparatively speaking, his auger.

He therefore commences with the appeal in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-3</a> : "Come near, ye peoples, to hear; and he nations, attend. Let the earth hear, and that which fills it, the world, and everything that springs from it. For the indignation of Jehovah will fall upon all nations, and burning wrath upon all their host; He has laid the ban upon them, delivered them to the slaughter. And their slain are cast away, and their corpses - their stench will arise, and mountains melt with their blood." The summons does not invite them to look upon the completion of the judgment, but to hear the prophecy of the future judgment; and it is issued to everything on the earth, because it would all have to endure the judgment upon the nations (see at <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>). The expression qetseph layeho&#772;va&#770;h implies that Jehovah was ready to execute His wrath (compare yo&#772;m layeho&#772;va&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>). The nations that are hostile to Jehovah are slaughtered, the bodies remain unburied, and the streams of blood loosen the firm masses of the mountains, so that they melt away. On the stench of the corpses, compare <a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>. Even if cha&#770;sam, in this instance, does not mean "to take away the breath with the stench," there is no doubt that Ezekiel had this prophecy of Isaiah in his mind, when prophesying of the destruction of Gog and Magog (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>). </body></html>
