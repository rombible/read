All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their slain also shall be cast out - They would lie unburied.

Such treatment of the dead was regarded as a shame and a disgrace. It was on some occasions an intentional insult (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>); but here the idea is rather that it would be impossible to bury the slain on account of their number. In ancient times corpses often lay unburied on battle-fields (Herod., 3:12). <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall be molted with their blood</span>. When the feelings of the prophet are excited, he shrinks from no hyperbole. Here he represents the blood of God's enemies as shed in such torrents that mountains are melted by it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>No (No&#772;' 'Amo&#772;n in <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>) is the Egyptian nu-Amun  equals  &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (nu the spelling of the hieroglyphic of the plan of the city, with which the name of the goddess Nu&#775; t  equals  Rhea is also written). The ordinary spelling of the name of this city corresponds to the Greek &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;.<p><a href="/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>It is also a great Lord who dwells therein, a faithful and almighty defender. "No, there dwells for us a glorious One, Jehovah; a place of streams, canals of wide extent, into which no fleet of rowing vessels ventures, and which no strong man of war shall cross. For Jehovah is our Judge; Jehovah is our war-Prince; Jehovah is our King; He will bring us salvation." Following upon the negative clauses in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>, the next v. commences with k&#305;&#772; 'im (imo). Glorious ('add&#305;&#772;r) is Jehovah, who has overthrown Lebanon, i.e., Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>). He dwells in Jerusalem for the good of His people - a place of streams, i.e., one resembling a place of streams, from the fact that He dwells therein. Luzzatto is right in maintaining, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; point back to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, and therefore that meko&#772;m is neither equivalent to loco (tachath, instead of), which would be quite possible indeed, as <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, if not <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>, clearly proves (cf., <a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>), nor used in the sense of substitution or compensation. The meaning is, that, by virtue of Jehovah's dwelling there, Jerusalem had become a place, or equivalent to a place, or broad streams, like those which in other instances defended the cities they surrounded (e.g., Babylon, the "twisted snake," <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), and of broad canals, which kept off the enemy, like moats around a fortification. The word &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; was an Egyptian word, that had become naturalized in Hebrew; nevertheless it is a very natural supposition, that the prophet was thinking of the No of Egypt, which was surrounded by waters, probably Nile-canals (see Winer, R.W. <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>). The adjective in which ya&#770;daim brings out with greater force the idea of breadth, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a> ("on both sides"), belongs to both the nouns, which are placed side by side, &#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; (because permutative). The presence of Jehovah was to Jerusalem what the broadest streams and canals were to other cities; and into these streams and canals, which Jerusalem had around it spiritually in Jehovah Himself, no rowing vessels ventured &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, ingredi). Luzzatto renders the word "ships of roving," i.e., pirate ships; but this is improbable, as shu&#772;t, when used as a nautical word, signifies to row. Even a majestic ts&#305;&#772;, i.e., trieris magna, could not cross it: a colossal vessel of this size would be wrecked in these mighty and dangerous waters. The figure is the same as that in <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>. In the consciousness of this inaccessible and impenetrable defence, the people of Jerusalem gloried in their God, who watched as a sho&#772;phe&#772;t over Israel's rights and honour, who held as mechoqe&#772;q the commander's rod, and ruled as melekh in the midst of Israel; so that for every future danger it was already provided with the most certain help. </body></html>
