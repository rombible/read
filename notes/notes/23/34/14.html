What dismal changes sin can make! It turns a fruitful land into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let us compare all we discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings of providence around us, that we may be more diligent in seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord has commanded, his Spirit will perform. And let us observe how the evidences of the truth continually increase, as one prophecy after another is fulfilled, until these awful scenes bring in more happy days. As Israel was a figure of the Christian church, so the Edomites, their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of the kingdom of Christ. God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time, but the enemies of the church shall be desolate for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wild beasts of the desert - There is in the original here a paronomasia, which cannot be conveyed in a translation. The word rendered, 'wild beasts of the desert' (&#1510;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;  ts&#305;&#770;y&#305;&#770;ym), is rendered by the Septuagint, &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  daimonia, 'demons.' On the meaning of the word, see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>.<p>The wild beasts of the island - Margin, 'Ijim.' Hebrew, &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;  '&#305;&#770;yym (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). Probably the term denotes the jackal. Gesenius supposes it is so called from its howl, or nocturnal cry - from an Arabia word signifying to howl.<p>And the satyr - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>).<p>Shall cry to his fellow - A most striking description of the desolation, when all that is heard among the ruins shall be the doleful cry of wild beasts.<p>The screech-owl - Margin, 'Night-monster.' The word &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;  l&#305;&#770;yl&#305;&#770;yt (from &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;  layil, night) properly denotes a night-spectre - a creature of Jewish superstition. The rabbis describe it in the form of a female elegantly dressed that lay in wait for children at night - either to carry them off, or to murder them. The Greeks had a similar idea respecting the female &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  empouta, and this idea corresponds to the Roman fables respecting the Lamice, and Striges, and to the Arabic notions of the Ghules, whom they described as female monsters that dwell in deserts, and tear men to pieces (see Gesenius, Com. in loc; and Bochart, Hieroz. ii. 831). The margin in our version expresses the correct idea. All this is descriptive of utter and perpetual desolation - of a land that should be full of old ruins, and inhabited by the animals that usually make such ruins their abode. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. wild beasts of the desert &#8230; island&#8212;rather, "wild cats &#8230; jackals" (Isa 13:21).<p>screech owl&#8212;rather, "the night specter"; in Jewish superstition a female, elegantly dressed, that carried off children by night.

A Jewish legend made Lilith the first wife of Adam, and said that, having pronounced the Divine Name as a charm, she was changed into a devil. It was her special delight to murder young children (Buxtorf, 'Lex. Rabbin.,' <span class="accented">ad roe</span>.). The prophets, when they employ poetic imagery, are not tied down to fact, but are free to use the beliefs of their contemporaries in order to heighten the force of their descriptions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus does Jehovah avenge His church upon Edom. "For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense, to contend for Zion. And the brooks of Edom are turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land becomes burning pitch. Day and night it is not quenched; the smoke of Edom goes up for ever: it lies waste from generation to generation; no one passes through it for ever and ever." The one expression, "to contend for Zion," is like a flash of lightning, throwing light upon the obscurity of prophecy, both backwards and forwards. A day and a year of judgment upon Edom (compare <a href="/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-4.htm">Isaiah 63:4</a>) would do justice to Zion against its accusers and persecutors (r&#305;&#772;bh, vindicare, as in <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>). The everlasting punishment which would fall upon it is depicted in figures and colours, suggested by the proximity of Edom to the Dead Sea, and the volcanic character of this mountainous country. The unquenchable fire (for which compare <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>), and the eternally ascending smoke (cf., <a href="/revelation/19-3.htm">Revelation 19:3</a>), prove that the end of all things is referred to. The prophet meant primarily, no doubt, that the punishment announced would fall upon the land of Edom, and within its geographical boundaries; but this particular punishment represented the punishment of all nations, and all men who were Edomitish in their feelings and conduct towards the congregation of Jehovah. </body></html>
