What dismal changes sin can make! It turns a fruitful land into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let us compare all we discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings of providence around us, that we may be more diligent in seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord has commanded, his Spirit will perform. And let us observe how the evidences of the truth continually increase, as one prophecy after another is fulfilled, until these awful scenes bring in more happy days. As Israel was a figure of the Christian church, so the Edomites, their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of the kingdom of Christ. God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time, but the enemies of the church shall be desolate for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he hath cast the lot for them - He hath assigned to them the land of Edom to be occupied by them as their portion.

"And pelican and hedgehog take possession of it, and eared-owl and raven dwell there; and he stretches over it the measure of Tohu and the level of Bohu. Its nobles - there is no longer a monarchy which they elected; and all its princes come to nought." The description of the ruin, which commences in <a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> with a list of animals that frequent marshy and solitary regions, is similar to the one in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, which is founded upon this). Isaiah's was the original of all such pictures of ruin which we meet with in the later prophets. The qippo&#772;d is the hedgehog, although we find it here in the company of birds (from qa&#770;phad, to draw one's self together, to roll up; see <a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>). &#1511;&#1488;&#1514; is written here with a double kametz, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, according to codd. and Kimchi, W.B. (Targ. qa&#770;th, elsewhere qa&#770;q; Saad. and Abulwalid, qu&#770;q: see at <a href="/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>). According to well-established tradition, it is the long-necked pelican, which lives upon fish (the name is derived either from &#1511;&#1493;&#1488;, to vomit, or, as the construct is &#1511;&#1488;&#1514;, from a word &#1511;&#1488;&#1492;, formed in imitation of the animal's cry). Yanshu&#772;ph is rendered by the Targum q&#305;&#772;ppo&#772;ph&#305;&#772;n (Syr. kafu&#770;fo), i.e., eared-owls, which are frequently mentioned in the Talmud as birds of ill omen (Rashi, or Berachoth 57b, chouette). As the parallel to qa&#770;v, we have &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (stones) here instead of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;, the level, in <a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>. It is used in the same sense, however - namely, to signify the weight used in the plumb or level, which is suspended by a line. The level and the measure are commonly employed for the purpose of building up; but here Jehovah is represented as using these fore the purpose of pulling down (a figure met with even before the time of Isaiah: vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7-9</a>, cf., <a href="/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-8.htm">Lamentations 2:8</a>), inasmuch as He carries out this negative reverse of building with the same rigorous exactness as that with which a builder carries out his well-considered plan, and throws Edom back into a state of desolation and desert, resembling the disordered and shapeless chaos of creation (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>, where to&#772;hu&#772; va&#770;bho&#772;hu&#772; represents, as it does here, the state into which a land is reduced by fire). &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; has no dagesh lene; and this is one of the three passages in which the opening mute is without a dagesh, although the word not only follows, but is closely connected with, one which has a soft consonant as its final letter (the others are <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>). Thus the primeval kingdom with its early monarchy, which is long preceded that of Israel, is brought to an end (<a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>). &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; stands at the head as a kind of protasis. Edom was an elective monarchy; the hereditary nobility electing the new king. But this would be done no more. The electoral princes of Edom would come to nothing. Not a trace would be left of all that had built up the glory of Edom. </body></html>
