The Greek poets sing that the “life of the generations of men is as the life of the leaves of the trees” (Homer, <span class= "ital">Il. vi.</span> 146). To Isaiah’s sublime thoughts there came the vision of a time when even the host of heaven would fall as “a leaf from the vine, and as a fig from the fig-tree.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/34.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And all the host of heaven </span>— The sun, moon, and stars; <span class="ital">shall be dissolved </span>— We have frequently had occasion to observe, that, in the prophetic language, the heavenly luminaries represent kings, empires, and states: see note on <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>. The prophet here foretels the overthrow and dissolution of such states and kingdoms as were hostile to his church, whether under the Jewish or Christian dispensation. Or, alluding to a horrid tempest raging furiously, during which the heavens grow black, the sun disappears, and the stars seem to fall to the earth, and it appears as if the whole body of the heavens were about to be utterly dissolved, he intends to signify, that, during these destructive judgments, of which he speaks, the confusion and consternation of mankind would be as great as if all the frame of the creation were broken into pieces. Some, indeed, understand the words as intended of the day of general and final judgment, but the context preceding and following will not agree with such an interpretation. And it is very usual for the prophetic writers, both of the Old and New Testaments, to represent great and general changes and calamities in such words and phrases as properly agree to the day of judgment, and the dissolution of all things: as, on the contrary, they often set forth the glorious deliverances of God’s people by such expressions as properly and literally belong to the resurrection from the dead.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time.

This figure Vitringa supposes to be taken from the common prejudice by which the stars appear to be crystals, or gems, set in the azure vault of heaven, which may melt and flow down by the application of heat. The sense is, that the princes and nobles who had opposed God and his people would be destroyed, as if the sparkling stars, like gems, should melt in the heavens, and flow down to the earth.<p>And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll - The word 'scroll' here (&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;  se&#770;pher) means a roll, or a book. Books were made of parchment, leaves, etc., and were rolled together instead of being bound, as they are with us. The figure here is taken from what strikes the eye, that the heaven above us is "an expanse" (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;  ra&#770;q&#305;&#770;ya&#8219;) <a href="/genesis/1-8.htm">Genesis 1:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>,) which is spread out; and which might be rolled together, and thus pass away. It is possible that there may be a reference also to the fact, that in a storm, when the sky is filled with dark rolling clouds, the heavens seem to be rolled together, and to be passing away. The sense is, that there would be great destruction among those high in office and in power - a destruction that would be well represented by the rolling up of the firmament, and the destruction of the visible heavens and their host, and by leaving the world to ruin and to night.<p>And all their host shall fall down - That is, their stars; either by being as it were melted, or by the fact that the expanse in which they are apparently located would be rolled up and removed, and there being no fixtures for them they would fall. The same image occurs in <a href="/revelation/6-13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>.

A dissolution of the material frame of the heavens, in which the moon and stars are regarded as set, seems to be intended (comp. <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The slaughter of God's enemies is here connected with the cud of the world, as in the Book of Revelation (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a book</span>. Ancient books were written on long strips of paper or parchment, which, when unrolled, extended to many yards in length, but which might be rolled together "by means of one or two smooth round sticks into a very small compass."

The ordinary spelling of the name of this city corresponds to the Greek &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;.<p><a href="/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>It is also a great Lord who dwells therein, a faithful and almighty defender. "No, there dwells for us a glorious One, Jehovah; a place of streams, canals of wide extent, into which no fleet of rowing vessels ventures, and which no strong man of war shall cross. For Jehovah is our Judge; Jehovah is our war-Prince; Jehovah is our King; He will bring us salvation." Following upon the negative clauses in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>, the next v. commences with k&#305;&#772; 'im (imo). Glorious ('add&#305;&#772;r) is Jehovah, who has overthrown Lebanon, i.e., Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>). He dwells in Jerusalem for the good of His people - a place of streams, i.e., one resembling a place of streams, from the fact that He dwells therein. Luzzatto is right in maintaining, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; point back to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, and therefore that meko&#772;m is neither equivalent to loco (tachath, instead of), which would be quite possible indeed, as <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, if not <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>, clearly proves (cf., <a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>), nor used in the sense of substitution or compensation. The meaning is, that, by virtue of Jehovah's dwelling there, Jerusalem had become a place, or equivalent to a place, or broad streams, like those which in other instances defended the cities they surrounded (e.g., Babylon, the "twisted snake," <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), and of broad canals, which kept off the enemy, like moats around a fortification. The word &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; was an Egyptian word, that had become naturalized in Hebrew; nevertheless it is a very natural supposition, that the prophet was thinking of the No of Egypt, which was surrounded by waters, probably Nile-canals (see Winer, R.W. <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>). The adjective in which ya&#770;daim brings out with greater force the idea of breadth, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a> ("on both sides"), belongs to both the nouns, which are placed side by side, &#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; (because permutative). The presence of Jehovah was to Jerusalem what the broadest streams and canals were to other cities; and into these streams and canals, which Jerusalem had around it spiritually in Jehovah Himself, no rowing vessels ventured &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, ingredi). Luzzatto renders the word "ships of roving," i.e., pirate ships; but this is improbable, as shu&#772;t, when used as a nautical word, signifies to row. Even a majestic ts&#305;&#772;, i.e., trieris magna, could not cross it: a colossal vessel of this size would be wrecked in these mighty and dangerous waters. The figure is the same as that in <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>. In the consciousness of this inaccessible and impenetrable defence, the people of Jerusalem gloried in their God, who watched as a sho&#772;phe&#772;t over Israel's rights and honour, who held as mechoqe&#772;q the commander's rod, and ruled as melekh in the midst of Israel; so that for every future danger it was already provided with the most certain help. </body></html>
