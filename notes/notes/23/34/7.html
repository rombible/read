The figure is taken from the master of a family, who, preparing a great feast, and a sacrifice, finds it necessary to slay many lambs, rams, and fatted animals, so that his knife may be said to be <span class="ital">inebriated </span>with the blood and fat of the slain.” As to the application of this prophecy, in which the Edomites are particularly mentioned, it may be observed that they, together with the rest of the neighbouring nations, were ravaged and laid waste by Nebuchadnezzar, and the general devastation spread through all these countries by him may be the event which the prophet had first in view in this chapter: but, as Bishop Lowth observes, “this event, as far as we have any account of it in history, seems by no means to come up to the terms of the prophecy, or to justify so highly wrought and so terrible a description. And it is not easy to discover what connection the extremely flourishing state of the church or people of God, described in the next chapter, could have with those events, or how it could be the consequence of them, as it is there represented to be. By a figure, very common in the prophetical writings, any city or people, remarkably distinguished as enemies of the people and kingdom of God, is put for those enemies in general. This seems here to be the case with Edom and Bozra. It seems, therefore, reasonable to suppose, with many learned expositors, that this prophecy has a further view to events still future; to some great revolutions to be effected in later times, antecedent to that more perfect state of the kingdom of God upon earth, and serving to introduce it, which the Scriptures warrant us to expect.” Vitringa is of opinion, that Papal, as well as heathen Rome, <span class="ital">red </span>or drunken with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus, is here meant. And he observes, that <span class="ital">“Rome, </span>which, in the Hebrew, signifies <span class="ital">fortification, </span>well answers to Bozra, which signifies a <span class="ital">fortified city.” </span>Is not the destruction of the anti-christian powers foretold in the xviith, xviiith, and xixth chapters of the Revelation by St. John, here intended by Isaiah? and especially the destruction in Armageddon, termed <span class="ital">the great day of God Almighty, </span><a href="/revelation/16-14.htm" title="For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.">Revelation 16:14</a>, and that described <a href="/context/isaiah/19-17.htm" title="And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, every one that makes mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he has determined against it....">Isaiah 19:17-19</a>? Certainly these terrible destructions are to prepare the way for that millennial reign of Christ, described Revelation 20., and which seems to be intended in the next chapter of this prophecy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the unicorns - Margin, 'Rhinoceros' (&#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  re'e&#772;m&#305;&#770;ym from &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;  re'e&#770;m). This was evidently an animal well known in Palestine, since it is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament (<a href="/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9-10</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>, in all which places it is translated unicorn, or unicorn). The derivation of the word is uncertain, and it has been regarded as doubtful what animal is intended. The corresponding Arabic word denotes the oryx, a large and fierce species of the antelope. Gesenius, Schultens, De Wette, and Rosenmuller suppose that the buffalo is intended by the word. Bochart regards it as denoting the gazelle, or a species of the antelope. It can hardly, however, be regarded as so small an animal as the gazelle. The gazelle is common in the neighborhood of mount Sinai; and when Laborde passed through that region his companions killed four, 'the father and mother, and two little animals a fortnight old.' He says of them: 'These creatures, which are very lively in their movements, endeavored to bite when they were caught; their hair is a brown yellow, which becomes pale and long as the animals grows old.<p>In appearance they resemble the Guinea pig. Their legs are of the same height, but the form of their feet is unique; instead of nails and claws, they have three toes in front and four behind, and they walk. like rabbits, on the whole length of the foot. The Arabs call it El Oueber, and know no other name for it. It lives upon the scanty herbage with which the rain in the neighborhood of springs supplies it. It does not burrow in the earth, its feet not being calculated for that purpose; but it conceals itself in the natural holes or clefts which it finds in the rocks.' (Journey through Arabia Petrea, pp. 106, 107. Lond. 8vo. 1836.) Taylor (Heb. Con.) supposes it means the rhinoceros; a fierce animal that has a single horn on the nose, which is very strong, and which sometimes grows to the height of thirty-seven inches. The ancient versions certainly regarded the word as denoting an animal with a single horn. It denotes here, evidently, some strong, fierce, and wild animal that was horned <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, but perhaps it is not possible to determine precisely what animal is meant. For a more full investigation in reference to the kind of animal denoted by the word reem, see the notes at <a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9</a>. Here it represents that portion of the people which was strong, warlike, and hitherto unvanquished, and who regarded themselves as invincible.<p>Shall come down - Shall be subdued, humbled, destroyed.<p>With them - With the lambs and goats mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>.

The field of Waterloo has thus been celebrated, since the great battle there, for producing rank and luxuriant harvests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. unicorns&#8212;Hebrew, reem: conveying the idea of loftiness, power, and pre-eminence (see on [755]Job 39:9), in the Bible.

He therefore commences with the appeal in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-3</a> : "Come near, ye peoples, to hear; and he nations, attend. Let the earth hear, and that which fills it, the world, and everything that springs from it. For the indignation of Jehovah will fall upon all nations, and burning wrath upon all their host; He has laid the ban upon them, delivered them to the slaughter. And their slain are cast away, and their corpses - their stench will arise, and mountains melt with their blood." The summons does not invite them to look upon the completion of the judgment, but to hear the prophecy of the future judgment; and it is issued to everything on the earth, because it would all have to endure the judgment upon the nations (see at <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>). The expression qetseph layeho&#772;va&#770;h implies that Jehovah was ready to execute His wrath (compare yo&#772;m layeho&#772;va&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>). The nations that are hostile to Jehovah are slaughtered, the bodies remain unburied, and the streams of blood loosen the firm masses of the mountains, so that they melt away. On the stench of the corpses, compare <a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>. Even if cha&#770;sam, in this instance, does not mean "to take away the breath with the stench," there is no doubt that Ezekiel had this prophecy of Isaiah in his mind, when prophesying of the destruction of Gog and Magog (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>). </body></html>
