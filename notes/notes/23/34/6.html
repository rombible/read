All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sword of the Lord is filled with blood - The idea here is taken from the notion of sacrifice, and is, that God would devote to sacrifice, or to destruction, the inhabitants of Idumea. With reference to that, he says, that his sword, the instrument of slaughter, would be satiated with blood. "It is made fat with fatness." The allusion here is to the sacrifices which were made for sin, in which the blood. and the fat were devoted to God as an offering (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7.htm">Leviticus 7</a>)<p>With the blood of lambs and goats - These were the animals which were usually offered in sacrifice to God among the Jews. and to speak of a sacrifice was the same as to speak of the offering of rams, lambs, bullocks, etc. Yet it is evident that they denote here the people of Idumea, and that these terms are used to keep up the image of a sacrifice. The idea of sacrifice was always connected with that of slaughter, as the animals were slaughtered before they were offered. So here, the idea is, that there would be a great slaughter in Idumea; that it would be so far of the nature of a sacrifice that they would be devoted to God and to his cause. It is not probable that any particular classes of people are denoted by the different animals mentioned here, as the animals here mentioned include all, or nearly all those usually offered in sacrifice, the expressions denote simply that all classes of people in Idumea would be devoted to the slaughter. Grotius, however, supposes that the following classes are intended by the animals specified, to wit, by the lambs, the people in general; by the goats, the priests; by the rams, the opulent inhabitants.<p>For the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah - Bozrah is mentioned here as one of the chief cities of Idumea. It was a city of great antiquity, and was known among the Greeks and Romans by the name of Bostra. It is generally mentioned in the Scriptunes as a city of the Edomites <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>; <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>; but once it is mentioned as a city of Moab <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>. It probably belonged at different periods to both nations, as in their wars the possession of cities often passed into different hands. Bozrah lay southeast of Edrei, one of the capitals of Bashan, and was thus not properly within the limits of the Edomites, but was north of the Ammonites, or in the region of Auranitis, or in what is now called tho Houran.  It is evident, therefore, that in the time of Isaiah, the Edomites had extended their conquests to that region.<p>According to Burckhardt, who visited the Houran, and who went to Bozrah, it is at this day one of the most important cities there. 'It is situated,' says he, 'in the open plain, and is at present the last inhabited place in the southeast extremity of the Houran; it was formerly the capital of the Arabia Provincia, and is now, including its ruins, the largest town in the Houran. It is of an oval shape, its greatest length being from east to west; its circumference is three quarters of an hour. It was anciently encompassed with a thick wall, which gave it the reputation of great strength Many parts of this wall, especially on the west side, remain; it was constructed of stones of moderate size, strongly cemented together. The south, and southeast quarters are covered with ruins of private dwellings, the walls Of many of which are still standing, but the roofs are fallen in. The style of building seems to have been similar to that observed in all the other ancient towns of the Houran. On the west side are springs of fresh water, of which I counted five beyond the precincts of the town, and six within the walls; their waters unite with a rivulet whose source is on the northwest side, within the town, and which loses itself in the southern plain at several hours' distance; it is called by the Arabs, El Djeheir. The principal ruins of Bozrah are the following: A square building which within is circular, and has many arches and niches in the wall.<p>The diameter of the arounda is four paces; its roof has fallen in, but the walls are entire. It appears to have been a Greek church. An oblong square building, called by the natives Deir Boheiry, or the Monastery of the priest Boheiry. The gate of an ancient house com municating with the ruins of an edifice, the only remains of which is a large semicircular vault. The great mosque of Bozrah, which is certainly coeval with the first era of Mahometanism, and is commonly ascribed to Omar el Khattah. The walls of the mosque are covered with a fine coat of plaster, upon which are many Curie inscriptions in bas-relief, running all round the wall The remains of a temple, situated on the side of a long street which runs across the whole town, and terminates at the western gate,' etc. Of these, and other magnificent ruins of temples, theaters, and palaces, all attesting its former importance, Burckhardt has given a copious description in his Travels in Syria, pp. 226-235, Quarto Ed.

This Bozrah, one of the principal cities of Idumaea, is to be distinguished from "Bozrah of Moab," which was known to the Romans as "Bostra." It lay in the hilly country to the south-cast of the Dead Sea, about thirty-five miles north of Petra, and was one of the earliest settlements of the descendants of Esau, being mentioned as a well-known place in Genesis 34:33). The threats here uttered against it are repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), who says that "Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; all the cities thereof [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dependent cities] shall be perpetual wastes." Bozrah is probably identified with the modern <span class="accented">El-Busaireh</span>, a village of about fifty houses, occupying a site in the position above indicated, amid ruins which seem to be those of a considerable city (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 407; Robinson, 'Researches in Palestine,' vol. 2. pp. 570, 571). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Compare Grashof, Ueber das Schiff bei Homer und Hesiod, Gymnasial-programm 1834, p. 23ff.). The &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; ( equals  &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;) is the cross plank which connects the two sides of the ship. A piece is cut out of this on the side towards the rudder, in which the mast is supported, being also let into a hole in the boards of the keel (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;) and there held fast. The mast is also prevented from falling backwards by ropes or stays carried forward to the bows (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). On landing, the mast is laid back into a hollow place in the bottom of the ship (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). If the stays are not drawn tight, the mast may easily fall backwards, and so slip not only out of the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; but out of the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; also. This is the meaning of the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1503;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1501;. It would be better to understand ke&#772;n as referring to the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; than to the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;. The latter has no "hole," but only a notch, i.e., a semicircular piece cut out, and serves as a support to the mast; the former, on the contrary, has the mast inserted into it, and serves as a ke&#772;n, i.e., a basis, theca, loculamentum. Vitringa observes (though without knowing the difference between &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; and &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;): "Oportet accedere funes, qui thecam firment, h. e. qui malum sustinentes thecae succurrant, qui quod theca sola per se praestare nequit absque funibus cum ea veluti concurrentes efficiant."<p><a href="/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>Now indeed it was apparently very different from this. It was not Assyria, but Jerusalem, that was like a ship about to be wrecked; but when that which had just been predicted should be fulfilled, Jerusalem, at present so powerless and sinful, would be entirely changed. "Thy ropes hang loose; they do not hold fast the support of thy mast; they do not hold the flag extended: then is booty of plunder divided in abundance; even lame men share the prey. And not an inhabitant will say, I am weak: the people settled there have their sins forgiven." Nearly every commentator (even Luzzatto) has taken <a href="/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a> as addressed to Assyria, which, like a proud vessel of war, would cross the encircling river by which Jerusalem was surrounded. But Drechsler has very properly given up this view. The address itself, with the suffix ayikh (see at <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>), points to Jerusalem; and the reference to this gives the most appropriate sense, whilst the contrast between the now and then closes the prophecy in the most glorious manner. Jerusalem is now a badly appointed ship, dashed about by the storm, the sport of the waves. Its rigging hangs loose (Jerome, laxati sunt); it does not hold the ke&#772;n torna&#770;m fast, i.e., the support of their mast, or cross beam with a hole in it, into which the mast is slipped (the mesodme of Homer, Od. xv 289), which is sure to go to ruin along with the falling mast, if the ropes do not assist its bearing power (malum sustinentes thecae succurrant, as Vitruvius says). And so the ropes of the ship Jerusalem do not keep the ne&#772;s spread out, i.e., the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of the ship, whether we understand by it a flag or a sail, with a device worked upon it (see Winer, R.W. s. v. Schiffe). And this is the case with Jerusalem now; but then ('a&#770;z) it will be entirely different. Asshur is wrecked, and Jerusalem enriches itself, without employing any weapons, from the wealth of the Assyrian camp. It was with a prediction of this spoiling of Asshur that the prophet commenced in <a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; so that the address finishes as it began.
