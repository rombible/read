Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever - This passage describes the pride and self-confidence of Babylon. She was confident in her wealth; the strength of her gates and walls; and in her abundant resources to resist an enemy, or to sustain a siege. Babylon was ten miles square; and it was supposed to contain provisions enough to maintain a siege for many years. There were, moreover, no symptoms of internal decay; there were no apparent external reasons why her prosperity should not continue; there were no causes at work, which human sagacity could detect, which would prevent her continuing to any indefinite period of time.<p>Thou didst not lay these things to thy heart - Thou didst not consider what, under the government of a holy and just God, must be the effect of treating a captured and oppressed people in this manner. Babylon supposed, that notwithstanding her pride, and haughtiness, and oppressions, she would be able to stand forever.<p>Neither didst remember the latter end of it - The end of pride, arrogance, and cruelty. The sense is, that Babylon might have learned from the fate of other kingdoms that had been, like her, arrogant and cruel, what must inevitably be her own destiny. But she refused to learn a lesson from their doom. So common is it for nations to disregard the lessons which history teaches; so common for individuals to neglect the warnings furnished by the destruction of the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. so that&#8212;Through thy vain expectation of being a queen for ever, thou didst advance to such a pitch of insolence as not to believe "these things" (namely, as to thy overthrow, Isa 47:1-5) possible.<p>end of it&#8212;namely, of thy insolence, implied in her words, "I shall be a lady for ever."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">These things; </span> thy cruel usages of my people, and the heavy judgments which thou hadst reason to expect for them. <span class="ital">The latter end of it</span>; of that lady or of Babylon, and her glory and empire, or of thyself; here being a sudden change of the person, of which I have noted many examples in this prophet.

The rhythm requires it to be treated as a substantive in the genitive after “mistress.” It is used in exactly the same way in the name “Father of eternity” (ch. <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">these</span> things] thy cruelties;—in what sense she failed to lay them to heart is explained by the following clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the latter end of it</span>] or <span class="bld">the issue thereof,</span> i.e. the inevitable retribution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–10 <span class="ital">a</span></span>.

The idea of "continuance" is one of the primary instincts of human nature. Hence we regard it as certain that the sun will rise on the morrow. We expect things to "continue in one stay," and "to-morrow to be as to-day," if not even "more abundant." Babylon was not much more arrogant than other nations when she assumed that silo would be "a lady for ever." And she had more excuse than almost any other nation. Her capital was one of the most ancient cities, if not the most ancient city in the world (<a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> ).   Though not unconquered (see the comment on ver. 1), she had yet for two millennia or more maintained a prominent position among the chief peoples of the earth, and had finally risen to a prouder eminence than any that she had previously occupied. Still, she ought to have remembered that "all things come to an end," and to have so comported herself in the time of her prosperity as not to have provoked God to anger. <span class="cmt_word">So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart</span>. "These things" must refer to the calamities about to fall upon Babylon, of which she may have heard before the end came - since they had been prophesied so long previously - but which she did not take to heart. <span class="cmt_word">The latter end of it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the probable issue of her pride and cruelty" (Kay). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the gods of Babylon the proclamation of judgment passes onto Babylon itself. "Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter Babel; sit on the ground without a throne, O Chaldaeans-daughter! For men no longer call thee delicate and voluptuous. Take the mill, and grind meal: throw back they veil, lift up the train, uncover the thigh, wade through streams. Let thy nakedness be uncovered, even let thy shame be seen; I shall take vengeance, and not spare men. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name, Holy One of Israel." This is the first strophe in the prophecy. As v. 36 clearly shows, what precedes is a penal sentence from Jehovah. Both &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, are appositional genitives; Babel and Chaldeans (&#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>) are regarded as a woman, and that as one not yet dishonoured. The unconquered oppressor is threatened with degradation from her proud eminence into shameful humiliation; sitting on the ground is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>. Hitherto men have called her, with envious admiration, rakka&#770;h va&#8219;a&#770;nugga&#770;h (from <a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56</a>), mollis et delicata, as having carefully kept everything disagreeable at a distance, and revelled in nothing but luxury (compare &#8219;o&#772;neg, <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). Debauchery with its attendant rioting (<a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>), and the Mylitta worship with its licensed prostitution (Herod. i. 199), were current there; but now all this was at an end. &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;, according to the Masora, has only one pashta both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, and so has the tone upon the last syllable, and accordingly metheg in the antepenult. Isaiah's artistic style may be readily perceived both in the three clauses of <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a> that are comparable to a long trumpet-blast (compare <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>), and also in the short, rugged, involuntarily excited clauses that follow. The mistress becomes the maid, and has to perform the low, menial service of those who, as Homer says in Od. vii. 104, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (grind at the mill the quince-coloured fruit; compare at <a href="/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). She has to leave her palace as a prisoner of war, and, laying aside all feminine modesty, to wade through the rivers upon which she borders. Chesp&#305;&#772; has e&#774; instead of i&#774;, and, as in other cases where a sibilant precedes, the mute p instead of f (compare 'isp&#305;&#772;, <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>). Both the prosopopeia and the parallel, "thy shame shall be seen," require that the expression "thy nakedness shall be uncovered" should not be understood literally. The shame of Babel is her shameful conduct, which is not to be exhibited in its true colours, inasmuch as a stronger one is coming upon it to rob it of its might and honour. This stronger one, apart from the instrument employed, is Jehovah: vindictam sumam, non parcam homini. Stier gives a different rendering here, namely, "I will run upon no man, i.e., so as to make him give way;" Hahn, "I will not meet with a man," so destitute of population will Babylon be; and Ruetschi, "I will not step in as a man." Gesenius and Rosenmller are nearer to the mark when they suggest non pangam (paciscar) cum homine; but this would require at any rate &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, even if the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; really had the meaning to strike a treaty. It means rather to strike against a person, to assault any one, then to meet or come in an opposite direction, and that not only in a hostile sense, but, as in this instance, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, in a friendly sense as well. Hence, "I shall not receive any man, or pardon any man" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.). According to an old method of writing the passage, there is a pause here. But <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is still connected with what goes before. As Jehovah is speaking in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, but Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>, and as <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is unsuitable to form the basis of the words of Jehovah, it must be regarded as the antiphone to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>). Our Redeemer, exclaims the church in joyfully exalted self-consciousness, He is Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy One of Israel! The one name affirms that He possesses the all-conquering might; the other that He possesses the will to carry on the work of redemption - a will influenced and constrained by both love and wrath. </body></html>
