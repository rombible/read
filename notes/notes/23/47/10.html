Fair warning was indeed given them, by this and other prophets of the Lord, of this desolation; but they slighted that notice, and would give no credit to it; and therefore justly was it so ordered, that they should have no other warning of it, but that partly through their own security, and partly through the swiftness and subtlety of the enemy, when it came it should be a perfect surprise to them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>47:7-15 Let us beware of acting and speaking as Babylon did; of trusting in tyranny and oppression; of boasting as to our abilities, relying on ourselves, and ascribing success to our own prudence and wisdom; lest we partake of her plagues. Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness.

It means, that she had supposed that she was able by these to maintain the ascendancy over other nations, and perpetuate her dominion. She supposed that by her great power, her natural advantages, and her wealth, she could resist the causes which had operated to destroy other nations. Men often confide in their own wickedness - their cunning, their artifices, their frauds, their acts of oppression and cruelty, and suppose that they are secure against the judgments of God.<p>None seeth me - Compare <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a> : 'He said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hideth his thee; he will never see it.' See also <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>.<p>Thy wisdom - Probably the wisdom here referred to, was that for which Babylon was distinguished, the supposed science of astrology, and the arts of divination and of incantation. It may, however, refer to the purposes of the kings and princes of Babylon; and the meaning may be, that it had been perverted and ruined by relying on their counsels. But it more probably refers to the confidence in the wisdom and science which prevailed there.<p>Hath perverted thee - Margin, 'Caused thee to turn away.'

Procl., 'In Tim.,' p. 71; Phoenix Coloph. ap. Athen., 'Deipnos.,' 12:p. 530, E.; Diod. Sic., 2 31, etc.), led them on to that perversion of true science, astrology, which, when once entered upon, seduces the mind from all genuine and fruitful study of the celestial phenomena, and leads it into a labyrinth of absurdities.   It also puffed them up, and made them regard themselves as altogether superior to other nations (see the comment on ver. 8, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the gods of Babylon the proclamation of judgment passes onto Babylon itself. "Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter Babel; sit on the ground without a throne, O Chaldaeans-daughter! For men no longer call thee delicate and voluptuous. Take the mill, and grind meal: throw back they veil, lift up the train, uncover the thigh, wade through streams. Let thy nakedness be uncovered, even let thy shame be seen; I shall take vengeance, and not spare men. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name, Holy One of Israel." This is the first strophe in the prophecy. As v. 36 clearly shows, what precedes is a penal sentence from Jehovah. Both &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, are appositional genitives; Babel and Chaldeans (&#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>) are regarded as a woman, and that as one not yet dishonoured. The unconquered oppressor is threatened with degradation from her proud eminence into shameful humiliation; sitting on the ground is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>. Hitherto men have called her, with envious admiration, rakka&#770;h va&#8219;a&#770;nugga&#770;h (from <a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56</a>), mollis et delicata, as having carefully kept everything disagreeable at a distance, and revelled in nothing but luxury (compare &#8219;o&#772;neg, <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). Debauchery with its attendant rioting (<a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>), and the Mylitta worship with its licensed prostitution (Herod. i. 199), were current there; but now all this was at an end. &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;, according to the Masora, has only one pashta both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, and so has the tone upon the last syllable, and accordingly metheg in the antepenult. Isaiah's artistic style may be readily perceived both in the three clauses of <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a> that are comparable to a long trumpet-blast (compare <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>), and also in the short, rugged, involuntarily excited clauses that follow. The mistress becomes the maid, and has to perform the low, menial service of those who, as Homer says in Od. vii. 104, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (grind at the mill the quince-coloured fruit; compare at <a href="/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). She has to leave her palace as a prisoner of war, and, laying aside all feminine modesty, to wade through the rivers upon which she borders. Chesp&#305;&#772; has e&#774; instead of i&#774;, and, as in other cases where a sibilant precedes, the mute p instead of f (compare 'isp&#305;&#772;, <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>). Both the prosopopeia and the parallel, "thy shame shall be seen," require that the expression "thy nakedness shall be uncovered" should not be understood literally. The shame of Babel is her shameful conduct, which is not to be exhibited in its true colours, inasmuch as a stronger one is coming upon it to rob it of its might and honour. This stronger one, apart from the instrument employed, is Jehovah: vindictam sumam, non parcam homini. Stier gives a different rendering here, namely, "I will run upon no man, i.e., so as to make him give way;" Hahn, "I will not meet with a man," so destitute of population will Babylon be; and Ruetschi, "I will not step in as a man." Gesenius and Rosenmller are nearer to the mark when they suggest non pangam (paciscar) cum homine; but this would require at any rate &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, even if the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; really had the meaning to strike a treaty. It means rather to strike against a person, to assault any one, then to meet or come in an opposite direction, and that not only in a hostile sense, but, as in this instance, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, in a friendly sense as well. Hence, "I shall not receive any man, or pardon any man" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.). According to an old method of writing the passage, there is a pause here. But <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is still connected with what goes before. As Jehovah is speaking in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, but Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>, and as <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is unsuitable to form the basis of the words of Jehovah, it must be regarded as the antiphone to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>). Our Redeemer, exclaims the church in joyfully exalted self-consciousness, He is Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy One of Israel! The one name affirms that He possesses the all-conquering might; the other that He possesses the will to carry on the work of redemption - a will influenced and constrained by both love and wrath. </body></html>
