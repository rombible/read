Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hear now this - The prophet proceeds, in this verse and the following, to detail more particularly the sins of Babylon, and to state the certainty of the punishment which would come upon her. In the previous verses, the denunciation of punishment had been figurative. It had been represented under the image of a lady delicately trained and nurtured, doomed to the lowest condition of life, and compelled to stoop to the most menial offices. Here the prophet uses language without figure, and states directly her crimes, and her doom.<p>That art given to pleasures - Devoted to dissipation, and to the effeminate pleasures which luxury engenders (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). Curtius, in his History of Babylon as it was in the times of Alexander (v. 5. 36), Herodotus (i. 198), and Strabo Georg. xvi.), have given a description of it, all representing it as corrupt, licentious, and dissipated in the extreme. Curtius, in the passage quoted on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, says, among other things, that no city was more corrupt in its morals; nowhere were there so many excitements to licentious and guilty pleasures.<p>That dwellest carelessly - In vain security; without any consciousness of danger, and without alarm (compare <a href="/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>).<p>I am, and none else besides me - The language of pride. She regarded herself as the principal city of the world, and all others as unworthy to be named in comparison with her (compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>). Language remarkably similar to this occurs in Martial's description of Rome (xii. 8):<p>Terrarum dea gentiumque, Roma,<p>Cui par est nihil, et nihil secundum - <p>Rome, goddess of the earth and of nations, to whom nothing is equal, nothing second.'<p>I shall not sit as a widow - On the word 'sit,' see the note at <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>. The sense is, that she would never be lonely, sad, and afflicted, like a wife deprived of her husband, and a mother of her children. The figure is changed from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, where she is represented as a virgin; but the same idea is presented under another form (compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. given to pleasures&#8212;(See on [829]Isa 47:1). In no city were there so many incentives to licentiousness.<p>I am &#8230; none &#8230; beside me&#8212;(Isa 47:10). Language of arrogance in man's mouth; fitting for God alone (Isa 45:6). See Isa 5:8, latter part.<p>widow &#8230; loss of children&#8212;A state, represented as a female, when it has fallen is called a widow, because its king is no more; and childless, because it has no inhabitants; they having been carried off as captives (Isa 23:4; 54:1, 4, 5; Re 18:7, 8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am; </span> I am independent, and self-sufficient, and unchangeable, as that phrase implies, which therefore is appropriated to God, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning?

To carnal lusts and pleasures; gratifying her sensual appetite; indulging herself in everything that was agreeable to the senses; abounding in delicacies, and living deliciously; as is said of mystical Babylon, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>, particularly given to venereal pleasures. Curtius says (g), <p>"no city was more corrupt in its manners, or furnished to irritate or allure to immoderate pleasures. Parents and husbands suffered their children and wives to prostitute themselves to strangers, so that they had but a price.'' <p>Yea, every woman was obliged by a law to do this once in life, and that in a public manner, in the temple of Venus; the impurities of which are at large described by Herodotus (h) and Strabo (i): <p>that dwelleth carelessly; in great confidence and security, being fearless of danger, and insensible of any: <p>that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else besides me: sole monarch of the world, empress of the whole universe; no competitor with me, none that can rival me. These words are sometimes used by the eternal and unchangeable Jehovah of himself, and indeed they suit with none but him; and it is the height of insolence and blasphemy in a creature to use them of itself; they fitly express that sovereignty, supremacy, infallibility, and even deity, which mystical Babylon assumes and ascribes to her head: <p>I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children; not be without a head, king, or monarch, which is as a husband to the state; nor without numerous subjects, which are as children. The like mystical Babylon says, "I sit a queen, and am no widow", <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>. <p>(g) Hist. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 1.((h) Clio, sive l. 1. c. 199.

"Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter Babel; sit on the ground without a throne, O Chaldaeans-daughter! For men no longer call thee delicate and voluptuous. Take the mill, and grind meal: throw back they veil, lift up the train, uncover the thigh, wade through streams. Let thy nakedness be uncovered, even let thy shame be seen; I shall take vengeance, and not spare men. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name, Holy One of Israel." This is the first strophe in the prophecy. As v. 36 clearly shows, what precedes is a penal sentence from Jehovah. Both &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in relation to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, are appositional genitives; Babel and Chaldeans (&#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>) are regarded as a woman, and that as one not yet dishonoured. The unconquered oppressor is threatened with degradation from her proud eminence into shameful humiliation; sitting on the ground is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>. Hitherto men have called her, with envious admiration, rakka&#770;h va&#8219;a&#770;nugga&#770;h (from <a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56</a>), mollis et delicata, as having carefully kept everything disagreeable at a distance, and revelled in nothing but luxury (compare &#8219;o&#772;neg, <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). Debauchery with its attendant rioting (<a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>), and the Mylitta worship with its licensed prostitution (Herod. i. 199), were current there; but now all this was at an end. &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;, according to the Masora, has only one pashta both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, and so has the tone upon the last syllable, and accordingly metheg in the antepenult. Isaiah's artistic style may be readily perceived both in the three clauses of <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a> that are comparable to a long trumpet-blast (compare <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>), and also in the short, rugged, involuntarily excited clauses that follow. The mistress becomes the maid, and has to perform the low, menial service of those who, as Homer says in Od. vii. 104, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (grind at the mill the quince-coloured fruit; compare at <a href="/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). She has to leave her palace as a prisoner of war, and, laying aside all feminine modesty, to wade through the rivers upon which she borders. Chesp&#305;&#772; has e&#774; instead of i&#774;, and, as in other cases where a sibilant precedes, the mute p instead of f (compare 'isp&#305;&#772;, <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>). Both the prosopopeia and the parallel, "thy shame shall be seen," require that the expression "thy nakedness shall be uncovered" should not be understood literally. The shame of Babel is her shameful conduct, which is not to be exhibited in its true colours, inasmuch as a stronger one is coming upon it to rob it of its might and honour. This stronger one, apart from the instrument employed, is Jehovah: vindictam sumam, non parcam homini. Stier gives a different rendering here, namely, "I will run upon no man, i.e., so as to make him give way;" Hahn, "I will not meet with a man," so destitute of population will Babylon be; and Ruetschi, "I will not step in as a man." Gesenius and Rosenmller are nearer to the mark when they suggest non pangam (paciscar) cum homine; but this would require at any rate &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, even if the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; really had the meaning to strike a treaty. It means rather to strike against a person, to assault any one, then to meet or come in an opposite direction, and that not only in a hostile sense, but, as in this instance, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, in a friendly sense as well. Hence, "I shall not receive any man, or pardon any man" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.). According to an old method of writing the passage, there is a pause here. But <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is still connected with what goes before. As Jehovah is speaking in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, but Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>, and as <a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a> is unsuitable to form the basis of the words of Jehovah, it must be regarded as the antiphone to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>). Our Redeemer, exclaims the church in joyfully exalted self-consciousness, He is Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy One of Israel! The one name affirms that He possesses the all-conquering might; the other that He possesses the will to carry on the work of redemption - a will influenced and constrained by both love and wrath. </body></html>
