She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service.

Babylon, that had been regarded as a delicately-trained female, was to be reduced to the lowest condition of poverty and wretchedness - represented here by being compelled to perform the most menial and laborious offices, and submitting to the deepest disgrace and ignominy. There is an allusion here to the custom of grinding in the East. The mills which were there commonly used, and which are also extensively used to this day, consisted of two stones, of which the lower one was convex on the upper side, and the upper one was concave on thee lower side, so that they fitted into each other. The hole for receiving the grain was in the center of the upper stone, and in the process of grinding the lower one was fixed, and the upper one was turned round, usually by two women (see <a href="/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>), with considerable velocity by means of a handle. Watermills were not invented until a little before the time of Augustus Caesar; and windmills long after. The custom of using handmills is the primitive custom everywhere, and they are still in use in some parts of Scotland, and generally in the East. (See Mr. Pennant's "Tour to the Hebrides," and the Oriental travelers generally. Grinding was usually performed by the women, though it was often regarded as the work of slaves. It was often inflicted on slaves as a punishment.<p>Molendum in pistrino; vapulandum; habendae compedes.<p>Terent. Phormio ii. 1. 19.<p>In the East it was the usual work of female slaves see (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>, in the Septuagint) 'Women alone are employed to grind their corn.' (Shaw, "Algiers and Tunis," p. 297) 'They are the female slaves that are generally employed in the East at those handmills. It is extremely laborious, and esteemed the lowest employment in the house.' (Sir John Chardin, Harmer's Obs. i. 153) Compare Lowth, and Gesen. "Commentary uber Isaiah." This idea of its being a low employment is expressed by <a href="/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a> : 'Let my wife grind unto another.' The idea of its being a most humble and laborious employment was long since exhibited by Homer:<p>A woman next, then laboring at the mill,<p>Hard by, where all his numerous mills he kept.<p>Gave him the sign propitious from within.<p>twelve damsels toiled to turn them, day by day<p>Meal grinding, some of barley, some of wheat,<p>Marrow of man The rest (their portion ground)<p>All slept, one only from her task as yet<p>Ceased not, for she was feeblest of them all;<p>She rested on her mill, and thus pronounced:<p>'Jove, Father, Governor, of heaven and earth!<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. millstones&#8212;like the querns or hand-mills, found in this country, before the invention of water mills and windmills: a convex stone, made by the hand to turn in a concave stone, fitted to receive it, the corn being ground between them: the office of a female slave in the East; most degrading (Job 31:10; Mt 24:41).<p>uncover thy locks&#8212;rather, "take off thy veil" [Horsley]: perhaps the removal of the plaited hair worn round the women's temples is included; it, too, is a covering (1Co 11:15); to remove it and the veil is the badge of the lowest female degradation; in the East the head is the seat of female modesty; the face of a woman is seldom, the whole head almost never, seen bare (see on [827]Isa 22:8).<p>make bare the leg&#8212;rather "lift up (literally, 'uncover'; as in lifting up the train the leg is uncovered) thy flowing train." In Mesopotamia, women of low rank, as occasion requires, wade across the rivers with stript legs, or else entirely put off their garments and swim across.

"Remember this, and become firm, take it to heart, ye rebellious ones! Remember the beginning from the olden time, that I am God, and none else: Deity, and absolutely none like me: proclaiming the issue from the beginning, and from ancient times what has not yet taken place, saying, My counsel shall stand, and all my good pleasure I carry out: calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a distant land: not only have I spoken, I also bring it; I have purposed it, I also execute it." The object to which "this" points back is the nothingness of idols and idolatry. The persons addressed are the &#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (those apostatizing), but, as &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; shows, whether it mean &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; or &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>), such as have not yet actually carried out their rebellion or apostasy, but waver between Jehovahism and heathenism, and are inclined to the latter. &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is hardly a denom. hithpalel of &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of "man yourselves," since &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, whether it signifies a husband or a social being, or like &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, a frail or mortal being, is at any rate equivalent to &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, and therefore never shows the modification u. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) signifies to be firm, strong, compact; in the piel (rabb.), to be well-grounded; nithpael, to be fortified, established; here hithpoel, "show yourselves firm" (Targ., Jer.: fundamini ne rursum subitus idololatriae vos turbo subvertat). That they may strengthen themselves in faith and fidelity, they are referred to the history of their nation; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are not prophecies given at an earlier time - a meaning which the priora only acquire in such a connection as <a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a> - but former occurrences. They are to pass before their minds the earlier history, and indeed "from the olden time." "Remember:" zikhru&#772; is connected with the accusative of the object of remembrance, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; points to its result. An earnest and thoughtful study of history would show them that Jehovah alone was El, the absolutely Mighty One, and 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m, the Being who united in Himself all divine majesty by which reverence was evoked. The participles in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> are attached to the "I" of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;. It is Jehovah, the Incomparable, who has now, as at other times from the very commencement of the new turn in history, predicted the issue of which it would lead, and miqqedem, i.e., long before, predicted things that have not yet occurred, and which therefore lit outside the sphere of human combination - another passage like <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>, etc., in which what is predicted in these prophecies lays claim to the character of a prediction of long standing, and not of one merely uttered a few years before. The &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, in which the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are already in progress (<a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>), is to be regarded as the prophet's ideal present; for Jehovah not only foretells before the appearance of Cyrus what is to be expected of him, but declares that His determination must be realized, that He will bring to pass everything upon which His will is set, and summons the man upon the stage of history as the instrument of its accomplishment, so that He knew Cyrus before he himself had either consciousness or being (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4-5</a>). The east is Persis (<a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>); and the distant land, the northern part of Media (as in <a href="/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>). Cyrus is called an eagle, or, strictly speaking, a bird of prey (&#8219;ayit),<p>(Note: The resemblance to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) is merely accidental. This name for the eagle is traceable, like avid, to a root va&#770;, to move with the swiftness of the wind. This was shown by Passow, compare Kuhn's Zeitschrift, i. 29, where we also find at 10, 126 another but less probable derivation from a root i, to go (compare eva, a course).)<p>just as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a> Nebuchadnezzar is called a nesher. According to Cyrop. vii. 1, 4, the campaign of Cyrus was &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Instead of &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the keri reads more clearly, though quite unnecessarily, (&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (see e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>). The correlate &#1488;&#1507; (<a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>), which is only attached to the second verb the second time, affirms that Jehovah does not only the one, but the other also. His word is made by Him into a deed, His idea into a reality. &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; is a word used particularly by Isaiah, to denote the ideal preformation of the future in the mind of God (cf., <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>). The feminine suffixes refer in a neuter sense to the theme of the prophecy - the overthrow of idolatrous Babel, upon which Cyrus comes down like an eagle, in the strength of Jehovah. So far we have the nota bene for those who are inclined to apostasy. They are to lay to heart the nothingness of the heathen gods, and, on the other hand, the self-manifestation of Jehovah from the olden time, that is to say, of the One God who is now foretelling and carrying out the destruction of the imperial city through the eagle from the east. </body></html>
