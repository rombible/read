And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The multitude of camels - Lowth renders this, 'An inundation of camels.' The Hebrew word properly denotes an inundation or overflowing of waters, but it is not improperly applied to a numerous caravan or company of animals. The camel is a well-known useful animal that constitutes the principal beast of burden in Arabia, and that may, indeed, be said to constitute its wealth. It is frequently spoken of as 'the ship of the desert.' The description here is strictly applicable to Arabia; and, undoubtedly, the prophet meant to say, that that country would be blessed with the true religion, and that her merchandise and wealth would become tributary to the church of God.<p>Shall cover thee - Shall come in such multitudes as to fill thee. and to be spread out all over thee. Thus we speak of a land being covered with flocks and herds.<p>The dromedaries - The dromedary is a species of camel that is found principally in Arabia, with one bunch or protuberance on its back, in distinction from the Bactrian camel, which has two bunches (Webster). 'It is found,' says Dr. Shaw, 'in Barbary, though much more rarely there than in the Levant. It is chiefly remarkable for its prodigious swiftness; the Arabs affirming that it will run over as much ground in one day as one of their best horses will perform in eight or ten. The Shiekh who conducted us to Mount Sinai rode upon a camel of this kind, and would frequently divert us with an instance of its great abilities. For he would depart from our caravan, reconnoitre another just in view, and return to us again in less than a quarter of an hour. It differeth from the common camel in being of a finer and rounder shape, and in having on its back a lesser bunch or protuberance.' (Shaw's Travels, p. 240.) Hence, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>, the prophet speaks of the 'swift dromedary.' The idea here is, that these fleet animals, so valuable to the inhabitants of Arabia, would come bringing their merchandise for the service of the church of God; that is, the wealth of Midian and Ephah would be devoted to him.<p>Midian - Midian was the fourth son of Abraham and Keturah <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a>, and was the father of the Midianites. The Midianites are frequently mentioned in the Scriptures (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28-36</a>; <a href="/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-7.htm">Judges 6:7-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>, et al.) As early as the time of Jacob they were employed in traffic, and were associated with the Ishmaelites in this business, for it was to a company of these people that Joseph was sold by his brethren <a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>. 'The original and appropriate district of the Midianites seems to have been on the east side of the Elanitic branch of the Red Sea, where the Arabian geographers place the city of Madian. But they appear to have spread themselves northward, probably along the desert coast of Mount Seir, to the vicinity of the Moabites; and on the other side, also, they covered a territory extending to the neighborhood of Mount Sinai' (Robinson's Calmet). Generally, the names Midianites and Ishmaelites seem to have been nearly synonymous.<p>Ephah - Ephah was the oldest son of Midian <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a>, and dwelt in Arabia Petraea, and gave name to the city of Ephah, called here by the Septuagint, &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;  Gaipha (Goepha). This city, and the small extent of country around it, constituted a part of Midian on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, to which the territories of Midian extended. It abounded in dromedaries and camels <a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a>.<p>All they from Sheba shall come - Sheba is celebrated in the Scriptures chiefly as the place from where the Queen of that country came to visit Solomon <a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-1.htm">2 Chronicles 9:1</a>. That it abounded in wealth, may be inferred from the train which accompanied her, and from the presents with which she came to Solomon. 'And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and much fine gold, and precious stones' <a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>. Whether it was the same country as Seba has been a matter of uncertainty (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>). It is elsewhere <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> mentioned as a place from where presents should be brought to Solomon:<p>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents;<p>The kings of Sheba and Seha shall offer gifts.<p>It is usually mentioned as a place in which gold and incense abounded. 'To him shall be given the gold of Sheba <a href="/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a>; 'To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba' <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; 'The merchants of Sheba were thy merchants' <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>. According to Bruce, it was situated in Abyssinia in Ethiopa, and this has been the common opinion. It was south of Egypt, and the contact between Sheba and Jerusalem was not difficult; and probably a constant traffic was maintained between the two countries. In the time of the Mamclukes, before the conquest of Egypt and Arabia by Selim, a caravan constantly set out from Abyssinia for Jerusalem (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>).<p>They shall bring gold and incense - That this country abounded in incense, see the passages of Scripture referred to above. On the meaning of the wood 'incense,' see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The idea is, that they would bring the most valuable productions of their country and devote them to God - perhaps designed to show that the wealth of Africa should yet be consecrated to the cause of the true religion.<p>And they shall show forth - These distant lands shall join in the worship of Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. camels&#8212;laden with merchandise; the camel is "the ship of the desert" (compare Isa 30:6).<p>cover thee&#8212;so many of them shall there be.<p>dromedaries&#8212;They have one hunch on the back, whereas the camel has two: distinguished for swiftness (Jer 2:23).<p>Midian&#8212;east of the Elanitic branch of the Red Sea, and stretching northward along Mount Seir.

Midian was a son of Abraham by Keturah, and a son of Midian, <a href="/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a> these and their posterity inhabit Arabia; and so this is a prophecy of the conversion of the Arabians that dwell in Arabia Felix, Petraea, and Deserts; and so the Targum, <p>"a multitude of Arabians shall cover thee round about.'' <p>A dromedary is a lesser camel, and swifter than the others; and both are very frequent in these countries, and used in travelling. Strabo (y) calls the Arabian Scenites feeders of camels. <p>All they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; Sheba was another of the posterity of Abraham by Keturah, <a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a> and lived near the others; the queen of this country came to hear the wisdom of Solomon; but the people of it in the latter, day will come to a greater than he; even to Christ and to his church, and bring their gold and incense, as the wise men did to Christ, and shall honour the Lord with their substance; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>, <p>and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord; who has called them by his grace out of Mahometan darkness, into the marvellous light of the Gospel. These were the things the Sabaeans abounded with. Strabo (z) says, that frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon, grew with them; and that they have such an abundance of spices, that they use the branches of cinnamon, cassia, and other things, for fuel; and that some of them are so rich through merchandise, that they have very sumptuous houses, and much furniture of gold and silver, as vessels, beds, tripods, cups with covers; and even that their gates, and walls, and roofs, are adorned with ivory, gold and silver, and precious stones. And so Pliny (a) observes: that the Sabaeans are very rich in fruitful and odoriferous woods, and in mines of gold, and other things; see <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>.

The first is a procession of camels and flocks representing the tribute of the East.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of camels</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a multitude - a continual stream of caravans</span> (Kay). These would be composed of merchants from Midian and Ephah, and would bring goods from Sheba. The Midianite caravans of camels are mentioned as early as the time of Jacob, when they carried "spicery and balm and myrrh" from the land of Gilead into Egypt (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25, 28, 36</a>). Ephah is a sub-tribe of Midian (<a href="/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a>). These nomads would visit the distant Sheba, in Happy Arabia, for purposes of trade, and would procure there gold and incense, which they would convey to Palestine. The "Sheba" intended is doubtless that whose queen visited Solomon, and brought with her gold in abundance, and "of spices very great store, and precious stones" (<a href="/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). The Egyptians appear to have called the kingdom of the Shebaim (Sabaeans) "Punt," and to have traded with it from a very early time, especially for frankincense (' Records of the Past,' vol. 10. pp. 14-19; Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 132-134, 221-224). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">dromedaries</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the young camels</span>, or <span class="accented">the camel colts. <span class="cmt_word"></span>All they</span> <span class="cmt_word">from Sheba shall come;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (i.e. the camels of Midian and Ephah) <span class="accented">shall come all together from Sheba.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah, having thus come as a Redeemer to His people, who have hitherto been lying under the curse, makes an everlasting covenant with them. "And I, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My Spirit which is upon thee, and my word which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy seed, and out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever." In the words, "And I, this is my covenant with them," we have a renewal of the words of God to Abram in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>, "As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee." Instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; we have in the same sense &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (not &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, as in <a href="/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>); we find this very frequently in Jeremiah. The following prophecy is addressed to Israel, the "servant of Jehovah," which has been hitherto partially faithful and partially unfaithful, but which has now returned to fidelity, viz., the "remnant of Israel," which has been rescued through the medium of a general judgment upon the nations, and to which the great body of all who fear God from east to west attach themselves. This church of the new covenant has the Spirit of God over it, for it comes down upon it from above; and the comforting saving words of God are not only the blessed treasure of its heart, but the confession of its mouth which spreads salvation all around. The words intended are those which prove, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>, the seeds of the new heaven and the new earth. The church of the last days, endowed with the Spirit of God, and never again forsaking its calling, carries them as the evangelist of God in her apostolic mouth. The subject of the following prophecy is the new Jerusalem, the glorious centre of this holy church. </body></html>
