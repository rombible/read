And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shalt thou see - Lowth renders this, 'Then shalt thou fear and overflow with joy;' and supposes that it refers to the agitation and anxiety of mind attending the scene, and to the joy consequent on the numerous conversions. His authority for this change is, that forty manuscripts (two of them ancient) have &#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, 'thou shalt fear,' instead of &#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;  t&#305;&#770;re'&#305;&#770;y, 'thou shalt see.' But though the change is of a single letter, there is not sufficient authority to make it, nor does the sense require it. The Vulgate, Septuagint, Chaldee, Syiac, Arabic, and Castellio, all render it in accordance with the present reading of the Hebrew text. The idea is, that Jerusalem would look with deep interest on the great multitude that would be converted to her, and that the effect would be to cause the heart to overflow with joy.<p>And flow together - This translation, it is believed, by no means conveys the true sense of the passage. Indeed, it is difficult to make sense of the translation. It is true that the Hebrew word &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;  na&#770;har, means "to flow, to flow together"; whence the word &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;  na&#770;ha&#770;r, 'river.' But it may be used in the sense of flowing, or overflowing with joy; or it may seem to shine, to be bright, the same as &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  nu&#770;r (Gesenius); and thence to be cheered, to rejoice, as when the countenance is bright and cheerful (compare <a href="/job/3-4.htm">Job 3:4</a>). Taylor (Hebrew Concordance) renders it, 'And be enlightened, or have the light flow upon thee.' The true idea is, doubtless, that of rejoicing; denoting the happiness which will always exist in the church when many are seen to come and give themselves to God.<p>And thine heart shall fear - The heart shall be ruffled, agitated, deeply excited by the view of the numbers that are converted, and by the evidence thus furnished of the divine favor and presence. The effect of numerous simultaneous conversions in a revival of religion, is always to produce awe and reverence. There is a conviction that God is near, and that this is his work; and a deep veneration produced by the demonstrations of his power which does not exist in other circumstances. This effect is described also by Jeremiah, <a href="/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a> : 'And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I shall procure unto her' (Jerusalem).<p>And be enlarged - Shall be swelled or filled with joy.<p>Because the abundance of the sea - Margin, 'Noise of the sea shall be turned unto thee.' Lowth and Noyes render it, 'The riches of the sea.' So the Septuagint, &#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  Ploutos thalasse&#772;s. The Chaldee renders it, 'There shall be transferred to thee the wealth of the west' (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1488; &#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;  &#8219;o&#770;tar ma&#8219;areba&#770;'). The Hebrew word &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  ha&#774;mo&#770;n properly denotes a noise or sound; as of rain, of the raging of the ocean, or of a multitude of people. Then it denotes a multitude or crowd of people itself <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-3.htm">Isaiah 33:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; a host or army <a href="/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-11.htm">Daniel 11:11-13</a>; a multitude of waters <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a>. It then denotes a multitude of possessions; a vast amount of wealth <a href="/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>. Here it may refer either to the multitude of the people that dwelt on the islands of the sea, or to their wealth that would be brought and devoted to Zion. As various kinds of property are immediately specified, it seems most natural to refer it to that; and then the idea is, that the wealth possessed by lands beyond the sea, or surrounded by the sea, would be devoted to the church of God. It will be remembered, that nearly all the wealth that was imported by Solomon and others to Judea came from beyond sea, and that it was natural to speak of such places as abounding in riches. The idea is, that the wealth of all those distant lands would be consecrated to the church - an idea denoting its great prosperity and glory when all lands should come under the influence of the truth.<p>Shall be converted - Hebrew, 'Shall be turned.' Instead of being employed in idolatry and sin; in purposes of pleasure and mere magnificence, it shall be turned to a different purpose.<p>The forces of the Gentiles - Margin, 'wealth.' The margin has undoubtedly the correct interpretation. The word used here (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  chayil, construct &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  che&#772;yil), usually, indeed, denotes strength, might, valor; an army, forces, host; but it also means riches, wealth <a href="/genesis/24-29.htm">Genesis 24:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="/job/20-15.htm">Job 20:15</a>. The Septuagint renders the passage, 'The riches of the sea, and of the nations, and of the people will come over to thee.' The sense is, that the wealth of the pagan world would be consecrated to the service of the church. To some extent, this has been the case, No small part of the great wealth of the Roman empire was I devoted to the service of the Christian church; and the wealth of what was then Pagan Europe, and of what was then Pagan and unknown America, has been, to a considerable extent, devoted to the Redeemer. The time will come when the wealth of India, of China, of Africa, and of the entire world, shall be devoted to the service of God, in a manner far more decided than has yet occurred in the most favored Christian lands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. see&#8212;(Isa 60:4), namely, the bringing back of thy sons.<p>flow together&#8212;rather, "overflow with joy" [Lowth]; or, from a different Hebrew root, "be bright with joy" [Gesenius] (Job 3:4).<p>fear&#8212;rather, beat with the agitation of solemn joy at the marvellous sight [Horsley] (Jer 33:9).<p>be enlarged&#8212;swell with delight.

Some render it, "then thou shall fear", as Aben Ezra (u), or be surprised at the sight; and others the next clause, "thou shall be enlightened" (w); that is, shall see, being enlightened, and shall increase in light and knowledge more and more; or "shine" (x), in great splendour and glory: <p>and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; shall fear the Lord and his goodness, and be enlarged with love to him, his truths and ordinances, and his people; and particularly shall be enlarged to receive in the most cordial manner those that flock unto her: <p>because the abundance of the Sea shall be converted unto thee: by which some understand the riches of the sea, that which is got out of it, or got upon it, in trading by it, this shall be converted to the use of the church and people of God; but rather an abundance of seafaring men is here meant, who shall be converted at this time, in which the grace of God will the more appear, as they are generally a very wicked and profligate set of men; or the inhabitants of the islands of the sea, such as Great Britain and others; or the sea may intend the several nations of the world, as waters do many people, nations, and kindreds, <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> and so it may denote a large abundance of converted persons everywhere, and more especially in the western parts of the world, in the European parts; since it is very common in Scripture to describe the western part of the world by the sea, the Mediterranean sea lying west of Judea. <p>The forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee; or their armies, every army of them; the soldiery will be converted, as well as the seafaring men, who are for the most part also exceeding wicked; not only kings will become real Christians, but their armies will be so too, their generals, officers, and common soldiers; and when this is once the case, woe to the whore of Rome! these will hate her, and burn her flesh with fire; these are the seven angels that shall come out of the temple, the church of God, to whom they have joined themselves, with the vials of God's wrath, and shall pour them upon the antichristian states; see <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>. <p>(u) "Tum timebis", Vitringa.

The two &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (with the indispensable metheg before the chateph, and a second to ensure clearness of pronunciation)<p>(Note: See the law in Br's Metheg-Setzung, 29.)<p>and &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; (also with the so-called strong metheg)<p>(Note: See idem, 28.)<p>indicate the terminus a quo. From all quarters of the globe will fear of the name and of the glory of Jehovah become naturalized among the nations of the world. For when God has withdrawn His name and His glory from the world's history, as during the Babylonian captivity (and also at the present time), the return of both is all the more intense and extraordinary; and this is represented here in a figure which recals <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a> (cf., <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). The accentuation, which gives pashta to &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, does indeed appear to make &#1510;&#1512; the subject, either in the sense of oppressor or adversary, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a>, or in that of oppression, as in <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>. The former is quite out of the question, since no such transition to a human instrument of the retributive judgment could well take place after the &#1500;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>. In support of the latter, it would be possible to quote <a href="/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, since &#1510;&#1512; is the antithesis to sha&#770;lo&#772;m. But according to such parallels as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>, it is incomparably more natural to take Jehovah (His name, His glory) as the subject. Moreover, &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, which must in any case refer to &#1499;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, is opposed to the idea that &#1510;&#1512; is the subject, to which &#1489;&#1493; would have the most natural claim to be referred - an explanation indeed which Stier and Hahn have really tried, taking &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1495; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>, and rendering it "The Spirit of Jehovah holds up a banner against him, viz., the enemy." If, however, Jehovah is the subject to &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;, &#1510;&#1512; &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512; must be taken together (like &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498;, <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; Ges. 111, 2, b), either in the sense of "a hemming stream," one causing as it were a state of siege (from tsu&#772;r, <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>), or, better still, according to the adjective use of the noun &#1510;&#1512; (here with tzakeph, &#1510;&#1512; from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;) in <a href="/isaiah/28-20.htm">Isaiah 28:20</a>; <a href="/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>, a closely confined stream, to whose waters the banks form a compressing dam, which it bursts through when agitated by a tempest, carrying everything away with it. <p>Accordingly, the explanation we adopt is this: Jehovah will come like the stream, a stream hemmed in, which a wind of Jehovah, i.e., (like "the mountains of God," "cedars of God," "garden of Jehovah," <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>, cf., <a href="/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>) a strong tempestuous wind, sweeps away (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;&#1492;, no&#772;sesa-b-bo&#770;, with the tone drawn back and dagesh forte conj. in the monosyllable, the pilel of nu&#772;s with Beth: to hunt into, to press upon and put to flight) - a figure which also indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah is the driving force in this His judicially gracious revelation of Himself. Then, when the name of Jehovah makes itself legible once more as with letters of fire, when His glory comes like a sea of fire within the horizon of the world's history, all the world form west to east, from east to west, will begin to fear Him. But the true object of the love, which bursts forth through this revelation of wrath, is His church, which includes not only those who have retained their faith, but all who have been truly converted to Him. And He comes (&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;) a continuation of &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) for Zion a Redeemer, i.e., as a Redeemer (a closer definition of the predicate), and for those who turn away from apostasy (&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>, and for the genitive connection <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>, &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, those who have turned away form the war). The Vav here does not signify "and indeed," as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-18.htm">Isaiah 57:18</a>, but "more especially." He comes as a Redeemer for Zion, i.e., His church which has remained true, including those who turn again to Jehovah from their previous apostasy. In <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a> the apostle quotes this word of God, which is sealed with "Thus saith Jehovah," as a proof of the final restoration of all Israel; for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (according to the Apocalypse, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) is to him the God who moves on through the Old Testament towards the goal of His incarnation, and through the New Testament towards that of His parousia in Christ, which will bring the world's history to a close. But this final close does not take place without its having become apparent at the same time that God "has concluded all in unbelief that He may have compassion upon all" (<a href="/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). </body></html>
