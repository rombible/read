The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sun shall be no more - A similar expression denoting the great prosperity and happiness of the church, occurs in <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a> (see the note at that place). The language here is exceedingly beautiful, and the idea is plain. It is designed to foretell the great glory which would exist in the church under the Messiah; a glory compared with which all that is furnished by the sun, moon, and stars would be as nothing. Expressions singular to this, and probably derived from this, are used by John in describing the lot of heaven. 'And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof' <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>. 'And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light' <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>. The idea is, the light and beauty of truth would be so great; the divine perfections shine forth so illustriously under the gospel, that the eye would be attracted to that light as superior to all the natural splendor of the sun and moon. All the wonders and beauties of the natural world would be lost in the superior brightness that would shine in the moral world.<p>Neither for brightness - In order to give light; or, with her brightness she shall not shine on the night.<p>Shall the moon give light unto thee - The beauty of the moon shall be lost in the superior effulgence of the rays of truth.<p>But the Lord shall be unto thee - He will furnish a revelation that will disclose far more of his perfections and his glory, and that will be far more valuable to thee as a light and guide, than all the splendor of the heavenly bodies.<p>And thy God thy glory - The honor of the church shall be that it has the true God for its protector. Its joys shall be found, not in the objects of nature - the beauty of created things - but in the glory of the divine perfections, and in the laws and plans of the Redeemer. His name, his attributes, his laws, his protecting care, constitute her main glory. It is an honor to the church to have such a God and Redeemer; an honor to share his favor, and to be under his everwatchful eye. The glory of the church is not her wealth, her numbers, her influence, nor the rank and talent of her ministers and members; it is the character of her sovereign Lord, and in his perfections it is right that she should exult and rejoice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Here begins the account of the sinless, pure, and perfect state of the church in the personal reign of Christ, even the New Jerusalem church state, as appears from the use of these very words, in the description of that state, <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> where it is read, "and the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof"; and in like manner the Targum renders these words, <p>"and ye shall have no need any more of the light of the sun by day, nor even of the light of the moon by night;'' <p>and so both Aben Ezra and Jarchi interpret it, <p>"ye shall have no need of the light of the sun;'' <p>and the former adds, because of the light of the Shechinah; and which seems to be the meaning of the next clause: <p>neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; that is, because of the exceeding brightness, splendour, and lustre of the divine majesty of Christ, who will appear personally among his people, neither sun nor moon will be able to give any light: as the light of a candle is made useless and unnecessary by the light of the sun, so the light of the sun and moon will be made useless and unnecessary by the vastly superior light and glory of Christ; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>, though the sun and moon may be understood here mystically, not of civil magistrates, who are sometimes signified by these luminaries; and who also will be no more used when this dispensation or personal reign of Christ shall take place; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, but rather of the Gospel and Gospel ordinances, which the church will no more stand in need of to enlighten, teach, and instruct them, refresh and comfort them, having the immediate presence of Christ with them, as follows: <p>but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, as it is interpreted in the above cited place in the Revelation; who, as he is the author of the light of nature, and of the light of grace, so of the light of glory in this state, and to all eternity; then will the saints in this light behold the face of God, which is not to be seen now; they shall see Christ in all his glory, in the glory of his Father, and of his holy angels; all the glorious forms, the angels of heaven, and all the saints, those spirits of just then made perfect, that shall come with Christ, and be clothed with glorious bodies; even the New Jerusalem descending from heaven, having the glory of God upon her; likewise all the doctrines of grace, now not so clearly understood; and all the mysteries of Providence, which will be laid open, and made manifest; and this clear light will continue for ever; there will be no more night, but one everlasting day: <p>and thy God thy glory; it is the saints' glory that God is their God; and it will be their glory in this state to have the God-man Jesus Christ personally with them; the tabernacle of God will be among them; God himself shall be with them, and be their God; and his glory shall lighten them, <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/60.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> moon give light to thee: but the LORD shall be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</span><p>(t) Signifying that all worldly means will cease, and that Christ will be all in all, as in Re 21:23,22:5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/60.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">thy glory</span>] <span class="bld">thy beauty</span>; <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a></span>, <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm" title="For the people turns not to him that smites them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 9:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19, 20</span>.

It is not implied that the sun and moon shall cease to exist; all that is said is that the new Jerusalem shall not be dependent on these natural luminaries. But that an actual physical illumination of the city by the glory of Jehovah is contemplated by the prophet can hardly be doubted. The basis of the conception is perhaps to be found in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.">Ezekiel 43:2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">fifth stanza.</span> Zion's crowning glories. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun shall be no more thy light by day</span>. Here Isaiah anticipates one of the most sublime thoughts in the Revelation of St. John the Divine, viz. that the heavenly Jerusalem, illuminated perpetually by the radiance of the Divine Presence, shall need neither light of the sun by day, nor of the moon by night, but shall be sufficiently illumined by the direct and primary light which streams down upon it from God himself. Whether the sun and moon will continue to exist or not is beyond the prophet's ken - he makes no announcement on the subject; sufficient for him that the redeemed bask perpetually in a Divine radiance shed upon them by the "Father of lights" (see <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). The germ of the idea appears in the earlier prophecies (<a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For brightness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">illumination. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light</span>. God is "the Father of lights" (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) - "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). All other light is but his shadow and his  reflex - his creature (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) - therefore perishable, not to be reckoned on for continuance (<a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>). But God abides; therefore his light will abide. He is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever" (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy God thy glory</span> (comp. <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>). God will not only be the Light of the Church, but her "Glory" and boast. As the Shechinah was the glory of the first, so "the eternal unchangeable light of Jehovah, with its peaceful gentleness and perfect purity" (Delitzsch), will be the glory of the final temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the thought that everything great in the world of man is to be made to serve the Holy One and His church, the prophet passes to what is great in the world of nature. "The glory of Lebanon will come to thee, cypresses, plane-trees and Sherbin-trees all together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and to make the place of my feet glorious." The splendid cedars, which are the glory of Lebanon, and in fact the finest trees of all kinds, will be brought to Zion, not as trunks felled to be used as building materials, but dug up with their roots, to ornament the holy place of the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a>), and also to this end, that Jehovah may glorify the "holy place of His feet," i.e., the place where He, who towers above the heaven of all heavens, has as it were to place His feet. The temple is frequently called His footstool (hado&#772;m ragla&#770;iv), with especial reference to the ark of the covenant (<a href="/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>) as being the central point of the earthly presence of God (cf., <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>). The trees, that is to say, which tower in regal glory above all the rest of the vegetable world, are to adorn the environs of the temple, so that avenues of cedars and plane-trees lead into it; a proof that there is no more fear of any further falling away to idolatry. On the names of the trees, see <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>. Three kinds are mentioned here; we found seven there. The words &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1493; &#1493;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; &#1514;&#1491;&#1492;&#1512; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; are repeated verbatim from <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>. </body></html>
