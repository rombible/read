And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who are these that fly as a cloud? - In multitudes so numerous, that they appear as a dense cloud. The prophet, in vision, sees a vast multitude coming to Jerusalem, or hastening to embrace the true religion - so numerous as to excite surprise, and to lead to the question, Who can they be? (compare <a href="/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>.) It is not uncommon to compare a multitude of persons to a cloud. Thus Livy (xxxv. 49), Rex contra peditum equitumque nubes jactat. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, the number of witnesses who are said to encompass Christians is compared to a cloud (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  nephos marturo&#772;n). So Virgil (Geor. iv. 60) compares a swarm of bees to a cloud - obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem. The Chaldee understands this of swift clouds, and takes the point of the comparison to be the velocity with which they would come. 'Who are these that come publicly (&#1489;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;  bigelay) as swift clouds?' But the comparison relates probably to the number, rather than to the swiftness with which they would come. Converts would be multiplied in such numbers, that they would seem to be like dense clouds making their way to Zion. This strikingly expresses the fact of the numerous conversions among the Gentiles, and is a most beautiful description of a revival of religion.<p>And as the doves to their windows - Lowth renders this, 'Like doves upon the wing' - supposing with Houbigant, that there is a slight error in the Hebrew text. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  Sun nossois - 'With their young.' But the true idea is contained in the common version. Doves fly to their houses, or to their windows, in an approaching storm. In like manner converts would hasten to Zion from the pagan world. They would come in great numbers, and would feel that if there they would be safe. Morier, in his "Second Journey," p. 140, has well illustrated this passage - 'In the environs of the city' (Ispahan), says he, 'to the westward, near Zainderood, are many pigeon-houses, erected at a distance from habitations, for the purpose of collecting pigeon's dung for manure; They are large, round towers, rather broader at the bottom than at the top, crowned by conical spiracles, through which the pigeons descend. Their interior resembles a honey-comb, pierced with a thousand holes, each of which forms a snug retreat for a nest. The extraordinary flights of pigeons which I have seen upon one of these buildings affords, perhaps, a good illustration of <a href="/isaiah/60-8.htm">Isaiah 60:8</a>. Their great numbers, and the compactness of their mass, literally looked like a cloud at a distance, and obscured the sun in their passage.' The prediction here has already, in part at least, been fulfilled. The rapid conversions in file time of the apostles accorded with this prediction. In numerous revivals of religion, also, has there been a fulfillment of it; and we are yet to anticipate a far more striking and glorious completion of it in the conversion of the pagan world to the Christian faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Referring to the vast number of converts before mentioned, who are compared to a "cloud" for the number of them, covering Judea as the clouds do the heavens; and for their elevation and situation, being raised from an earthly to a heavenly state; called with a high calling, and made partakers of an heavenly one; and for their being filled with the grace of God, as clouds with water; and for their unanimity, their coming together in a body, making as it were one cloud, and that openly and publicly, professing Christ, and joining themselves to his church, in the face of the world; and so the Targum, <p>"who are these that come publicly as the swift clouds?'' <p>and chiefly are they compared to a cloud for their swiftness in motion to Christ and his church; sinners; sensible of danger from the avenging justice of God, from his law, and from his wrath and displeasure, and eternal death, and being apprized of salvation and safety in Christ, make haste and flee to him as swiftly as a cloud driven by the winds; <p>and as the doves to their windows; or "dove houses", or "lockers and holes" (c); through which they enter, and to which they bend their course with great swiftness, when pursued by birds of prey, or through an eager desire after their young: converted persons may be compared to doves for their being a clean and cleanly creature; for their being amiable and lovely, chaste and loving; harmless and inoffensive, meek and humble, weak and timorous; mournful and disconsolate when they have lost their mate; and what dove houses are to these, Christ and his church are to converted persons, whither they flee for rest and shelter, and where they have both: the ordinances of Christ may be particularly meant by these holes or windows that doves make unto; by which, especially baptism, they enter into the church, and by means of which light is let into them, and through which Christ shows himself to them, Sol 2:9, what engages them to flee hither is their love to Christ, in order to have communion with him, and food for their faith; and when he causes them to come, or draws them by his grace, nothing can hinder; not the reproaches of the world, nor the temptations of Satan; nor objections from their own unworthiness. These words are said by the church, by way of admiration wondering at their numbers and swiftness in coming to her; see <a href="/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>. The Targum is <p>"the, captivity of Israel, who are gathered together, and come to their own land, as doves that return to their dove houses.'' <p>(c)  "ad columbaria sua", Montanus, Vitringa; "in suis forulis", Castalio Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/60.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who <i>are</i> these <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> <i>that</i> fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows?</span><p>(i) Showing what great number will come to the Church, and with what great diligence and zeal.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/60.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">as doves to their windows</span>] <a href="/genesis/8-9.htm" title="But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.">Genesis 8:9</a>.

From the East the prophet turns to the West, and describes the ships of the Mediterranean “like white doves upon the wing” converging on Jerusalem.

The prophet beholds the waters of the Mediterranean Sea covered with numerous ships, whose sails remind him of white clouds moving across the blue expanse of heaven, and again of doves wending their way homewards to their accustomed dove-cotes. The "windows" of the dove-cotes are the openings through which the birds pass into the towers where they breed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is now all darkness over mankind; but Zion is the east, in which this sun of suns will rise. <a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a> "For, behold, the darkness covereth the earth, and deep darkness the nations; and Jehovah riseth over thee, and His glory becomes visible over thee." The night which settles upon the world of nations is not to be understood as meaning a night of ignorance and enmity against God. This prophecy no doubt stands in progressive connection with the previous one; but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, the manifestation of judgment, through which Zion is redeemed, brings even the heathen from west to east, i.e., those who survive the judgment, to the fear of Jehovah. The idea is rather the following: After the judgments of God have passed, darkness in its greatest depth still covers the earth, and a night of clouds the nations. It is still night as on the first day, but a night which is to give place to light. Where, then, will the sun rise, by which this darkness is to be lighted up? The answer is, "Over Zion, the redeemed church of Israel." But whilst darkness still covers the nations, it is getting light in the Holy Land, for a sun is rising over Zion, viz., Jehovah in His unveiled glory. The consequence of this is, that Zion itself becomes thoroughly light, and that not for itself only, but for all mankind. When Jehovah has transformed Zion into the likeness of His own glory, Zion transforms all nations into the likeness of her own. <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a> "And nations walk to thy light, and kings to the shining of thy rays." Zion exerts such an attractive force, that nations move towards her light (&#1500; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; as in &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; ni sa &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; and other similar expressions), and kings to the splendour of her rays, to share in them for themselves, and enjoy them with her. All earthly might and majesty station themselves in the light of the divine glory, which is reflected by the church. </body></html>
