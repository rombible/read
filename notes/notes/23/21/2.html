In <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm" title="There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, Elam is numbered among the extinct nations, but the name, at all events, re-appears as applied to the Persians, though they were of a distinct race. It was, even as a mere forecast, perfectly natural that the two should be associated together as the future destroyers of the Nineveh and Babel empires, which to the prophet’s eye were identical in character and policy. The advance described as “from the wilderness” implies a march of part at least of the Medo-Persian army down the Choaspes and into the lowland of Chuzistan, bordering on the great Arabian desert.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils.

Babylon had long oppressed and ravaged other countries: and it was now her turn to be oppressed and ravaged. Elam was an eminent province of Persia, bordering upon Media, and is here put for Persia in general.

The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A grievous vision - Margin, as in Hebrew 'Hard.' On the word 'vision,' see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. The sense here is, that the vision which the prophet saw was one that indicated great calamity <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>.<p>Is declared unto me - That is, is caused to pass before me, and its meaning is made known to me.<p>The treacherous dealer - (&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;  chabo&#770;ge&#772;d). The perfidious, unfaithful people. This is the usual signification of the word; but the connection here does not seem to require the signification of treachery or perfidy, but of "violence." The word has this meaning in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>, <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a>. It refers here to the Medes; and to the fact that oppression and violence were now to be exercised toward Babylon. Lowth renders this:<p>'The plunderer is plundered, and the destroyer is destroyed;'<p>But the authority for so rendering it is doubtful. He seems to suppose that it refers to Babylon. The Hebrew evidently means, that there is to be plundering and devastation, and that this is to be accomplished by a nation accustomed to it, and which is immediately specified; that is, the united kingdom of Media and Persia. The Chaldee renders it, 'They who bring violence, suffer violence; and the plunderers are plundered.' Jarchi says, that the sense of the Hebrew text according to the Chaldee is, 'Ah! thou who art violent! there comes another who will use thee with violence; and thou plunderer, another comes who will plunder thee, even the Medes and Persians, who will destroy and lay waste Babylon.' But the Hebrew text will not bear this interpretation. The sense is, that desolation was about to be produced by a nation "accustomed" to it, and who would act toward Babylon in their true character.<p>Go up - This is an address of God to Media and Persia (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>).<p>O Elam - This was the name of the country originally possessed by the Persians, and was so called from Elam a son of Shem <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>. It was east of the Euphrates, and comprehended properly the mountainous countries of Khusistan and Louristan, called by the Greek writers "Elymais." In this country was Susa or Shushan, mentioned in <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>. It is here put for Persia in general, and the call on Elam and Media to go up, was a call on the united kingdom of the Medes and Persians.<p>Besiege - That is, besiege Babylon.<p>O Media - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>).<p>All the sighing thereof have I made to cease - This has been very differently interpreted by expositors. Some understand it (as Rosenmuller, Jerome, and Lowth,) as designed to be taken in an "active" sense; that is, all the groaning "caused" by Babylon in her oppressions of others, and particularly of God's people, would cease. Others refer it to the army of the Medes and Persians, as if "their" sighing should be over; that is, their fatigues and labors in the conquest of Babylon. Calvin supposes that it means that the Lord would be deaf to the sighs of Babylon; that is, he would disregard them and would bring upon them the threatened certain destruction. The probable meaning is that suggested by Jerome, that God would bring to an end all the sighs and groans which Babylon had caused in a world suffering under her oppressions (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7-8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. dealeth treacherously&#8212;referring to the military stratagem employed by Cyrus in taking Babylon.

The discovery that Cyrus, at the time of his conquest of Babylon, Bore the title of "King of Ansan," not "King of Persia," coupled with the probability that "Ansan" was a part of Elam, lends a peculiar interest to these words. Isaiah could not describe Cyrus as "King of Persia," and at the same time be intelligible to his contemporaries, since Persia was a country utterly unknown to them. In using the term "Elam" instead, he uses that of a country known to the Hebrews (<a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>), adjoining Persia, and, at the time of his expedition against Babylon, subject to Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Besiege, O Media</span>.

Eleven years before he attacked Babylon, Cyrus had made war upon Astyages (Istuvegu), King of the Medes, had captured him, and become king of the nation, with scarcely any opposition (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus'). Hence the Medes would naturally form an important portion of the force which he led against Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">All the sighing thereof have I made to cease</span>.

Tartan (probably the same man) is met with in <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a> as the chief captain of Sennacherib. No Assyrian king of the name of Sargon is mentioned anywhere else in the Old Testament; but it may now be accepted as an established result of the researches which have been made, that Sargon was the successor of Shalmanassar, and that Shalmaneser (Shalman, <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, are the names of the four Assyrian kings who were mixed up with the closing history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It was Longperrier who was the first to establish the identity of the monarch who built the palaces at Khorsabad, which form the north-eastern corner of ancient Nineveh, with the Sargon of the Bible. We are now acquainted with a considerable number of brick, harem, votive-table, and other inscriptions which bear the name of this king, and contain all kinds of testimony concerning himself.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Expdition, i.-328-350, and the picture of Sargon in his war-chariot in Rawlinson's Five Great Monarchies, i. 368; compare also p. 304 (prisoners taken by Sargon), p. 352 (the plan of his palace), p. 483 (a glass vessel with his name), and many other engravings in vol. ii.)<p>It was he, not Shalmanassar, who took Samaria after a three years' siege; and in the annalistic inscription he boasts of having conquered the city, and removed the house of Omri to Assyria. Oppert is right in calling attention to the fact, that in <a href="/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a> the conquest is not attributed to Shalmanassar himself, but to the army. Shalmanassar died in front of Samaria; and Sargon not only put himself at the head of the army, but seized upon the throne, in which he succeeded in establishing himself, after a contest of several years' duration with the legitimate heirs and their party. He was therefore a usurper.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Les Inscriptions Assyriennes des Sargonides et les Fastes de Ninive (Versailles, 1862), and Rawlinson (vol. ii. 406ff.), who here agrees with Oppert in all essential points. Consequently there can no longer be any thought of identifying Sargon with Shalmanassar (see Brandis, Ueber den historischen Gewinn aus der Entzifferung der assyr. Inschriften, 1856, p. 48ff.). Rawlinson himself at first thought they were the same person (vid., Journal of the Asiatic Society, xii. 2, 419), until gradually the evidence increased that Sargon and Shalmanassar were the names of two different kings, although no independent inscription of the latter, the actual besieger of Samaria, has yet been found.)<p>Whether his name as it appears on the inscriptions is Sar-kin or not, and whether it signifies the king de facto as distinguished from the king de jure, we will not attempt to determine now.<p>(Note: Hitzig ventures a derivation of the name from the Zend; and Grotefend compares it with the Chaldee Sa&#770;re&#772;k, <a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a> (in his Abhandlung ber Anlage und Zerstrung der Gebude von Nimrud, 1851).)<p>This Sargon, the founder of a new Assyrian dynasty, who reigned from 721-702 (according to Oppert), and for whom there is at all events plenty of room between 721-20 and the commencement of Sennacherib's reign, first of all blockaded Tyre for five years after the fall of Samaria, or rather brought to an end the siege of Tyre which had been begun by Shalmanassar (Jos. Ant. ix. 14, 2), though whether it was to a successful end or not is quite uncertain. He then pursued with all the greater energy his plan for following up the conquest of Samaria with the subjugation of Egypt, which was constantly threatening the possessions of Assyria in western Asia, either by instigation or support. The attack upon Ashdod was simply a means to this end. As the Philistines were led to join Egypt, not only by their situation, but probably by kinship of tribe as well, the conquest of Ashdod - a fortress so strong, that, according to Herodotus (ii. 157), Psammetichus besieged it for twenty-nine years - was an indispensable preliminary to the expedition against Egypt. When Alexander the Great marched against Egypt, he had to do the same with Gaza. How long Tartan required is not to be gathered from <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>. But if he conquered it as quickly as Alexander conquered Gaza - viz. in five months - it is impossible to understand why the following prophecy should defer for three years the subjugation of Ethiopia and Egypt. The words, "and fought against Ashdod, and took it," must therefore be taken as anticipatory and parenthetical.<p>It was not after the conquest of Ashdod, but in the year in which the siege commenced, that Isaiah received the following admonition: "Go and loosen the smock-frock from off thy loins, and take off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, went stripped and barefooted." We see from this that Isaiah was clothed in the same manner as Elijah, who wore a fur coat (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>, cf., <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>), and John the Baptist, who had a garment of camel hair and a leather girdle round it (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>); for sak is a coarse linen or hairy overcoat of a dark colour (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/50-3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>), such as was worn by mourners, either next to the skin (&#8219;al-habba&#770;sa&#770;r, <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>) or over the tunic, in either case being fastened by a girdle on account of its want of shape, for which reason the verb cha&#770;gar is the word commonly used to signify the putting on of such a garment, instead of la&#770;bash. The use of the word a&#770;ro&#772;m does not prove that the former was the case in this instance (see, on the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm">2 Samuel 6:20</a>, compared with <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> and <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). With the great importance attached to the clothing in the East, where the feelings upon this point are peculiarly sensitive and modest, a person was looked upon as stripped and naked if he had only taken off his upper garment. What Isaiah was directed to do, therefore, was simply opposed to common custom, and not to moral decency. He was to lay aside the dress of a mourner and preacher of repentance, and to have nothing on but his tunic (cetoneth); and in this, as well as barefooted, he was to show himself in public. This was the costume of a man who had been robbed and disgraced, or else of a beggar or prisoner of war. The word ce&#772;n (so) is followed by the inf. abs., which develops the meaning, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. </body></html>
