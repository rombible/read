The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My heart panted - Margin, 'My mind wandered.' The Hebrew word rendered 'panted' (&#1514;&#1506;&#1492;  ta&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h) means to wander about; to stagger; to be giddy; and is applied often to one that staggers by being intoxicated. Applied to the heart, it means that it is disquieted or troubled. The Hebrew word "heart" here is to be taken in the sense of "mind."<p>The night of my pleasure - There can be no doubt that the prophet here refers to the night of revelry and riot in which Babylon was taken. The prophet calls it the night of "his" pleasure, because he represents himself as being "in" Babylon when it should be taken, and, therefore, uses such language as an inhabitant of Babylon would use. "They" would call it the night of their pleasure, because it was set apart to feasting and revelry.<p>Hath he turned into fear - God has made it a night of consternation and alarm. The prophet here refers to the fact that Babylon would be taken by Cyrus during that night, and that consternation and alarm would suddenly pervade the affrighted and guilty city (see <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. panted&#8212;"is bewildered" [Barnes].<p>night of my pleasure&#8212;The prophet supposes himself one of the banqueters at Belshazzar's feast, on the night that Babylon was about to be taken by surprise; hence his expression, "my pleasure" (Isa 14:11; Jer 51:39; Da 5:1-31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The night of my pleasure; </span> the night, in which I used to have a sweet repose and sleep.

"And Jehovah said, As my servant Yesha'yahu goeth naked and barefooted, a sign and type for three years long over Egypt and over Ethiopia, so will the king of Asshur carry away the prisoners of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, children and old men, naked and barefooted, and with their seat uncovered - a shame to Egypt." The expression "as he goeth" (ca'asher ha&#770;lac) stands here at the commencement of the symbolical action, but it is introduced as if with a retrospective glance at its duration for three years, unless indeed the preterite ha&#770;lac stands here, as it frequently does, to express what has already commenced, and is still continuing and customary (compare, for example, <a href="/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). The strange and unseemly dress of the prophet, whenever he appeared in his official capacity for three whole years, was a prediction of the fall of the Egypto-Ethiopian kingdom, which was to take place at the end of these three years. Egypt and Ethiopia are as closely connected here as Israel and Judah in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. They were at that time one kingdom, so that the shame of Egypt was the shame of Ethiopia also. &#8219;Erva&#770;h is a shameful nakedness, and &#8219;ervath Mitzrayim is in apposition to all that precedes it in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. She&#772;th is the seat or hinder part, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>, from sha&#770;tha&#770;h, to set or seat; it is a substantive form, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1506;&#1509;, &#1512;&#1506;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with the third radical letter dropt. Chashu&#772;phay has the same ay as the words in <a href="/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, which can hardly be regarded as constructive forms, as Ewald, Knobel, and Gesenius suppose (although &#1470;&#1497; of the construct has arisen from &#1470;&#1497;), but rather as a singular form with a collective signification. The emendations suggested, viz., chasu&#772;phe&#772; by Olshausen, and chasu&#772;ph&#305;&#772; with a connecting i by Meier, are quite unnecessary. </body></html>
