The “sea” has been explained (1) as the Euphrates, just as in <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>, it appears as used of the Nile (Cheyne). (2) As pointing to the surging flood of the mingled myriads of its population. (3) Xenophon’s description of the whole plain of the Euphrates, intersected by marshes and lakes, as looking like a sea affords, perhaps, a better explanation.<p><span class= "bld">As whirlwinds in the south . . .</span>—The “South” (or <span class= "ital">Negeb</span>) is here, as elsewhere, the special name of the country lying south of Judah. The tempests of the region seem to have been proverbial (<a href="/zechariah/9-14.htm" title="And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.">Zechariah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm" title="At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-24.htm" title="Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.">Jeremiah 13:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So it cometh.</span>—The absence of a subject to the verb gives the opening words a terrible vagueness. Something is coming “from the wilderness, a terrible land,” beyond it. The “wilderness” in this case is clearly the Arabian desert, through part of which the Euphrates flows. The context determines the “terrible land” as that of Elam and Media.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm" title="The burden of the desert of the sea.

And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>. Some think it is so called prophetically, because, although it was at present a populous city, it was shortly to be made desolate, and turned into a marsh, and pools of water. But <span class="greekheb">מדבר ים</span>may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">the plain of the sea: </span>for Babylon stood on a plain, and the country about it, and especially below it, toward the sea, was a great flat morass, often overflowed by the Euphrates and Tigris. “Semiramis,” says Herodotus, “confined the Euphrates within its channel, by raising great dams against it; for before it overflowed the whole country like a sea.” And Abydenus, speaking of the building of Babylon, observes, “It is reported that all this part was covered with water, and was called <span class="ital">the sea; </span>and that Belus drew off the waters, conveying them into proper receptacles.” It was only by these means, it appears, and by the many canals that were made in the country, that it became habitable. It, however, still more fully and perfectly answered the title of <span class="ital">the plain, </span>or <span class="ital">desert of the sea, </span>here given it, in consequence of the Euphrates being turned out of its channel by Cyrus, and afterward suffered still to drown the neighbouring country, by which it became, in time, a great barren, morassy desert, which it continues to be to this day. See note on <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm" title="It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelled in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.">Isaiah 13:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This second prediction, concerning Babylon, (which, with the two short prophecies following, makes the sixth discourse of this second part of Isaiah’s Visions,) “is a passage,” says Bishop Lowth, “of a singular kind for its brevity and force; for the variety and rapidity of the movements; and for the strength and energy of colouring, with which the action and event are painted. It opens with the prophet’s seeing, at a distance, the dreadful storm that is gathering, and ready to burst upon Babylon: the event is intimated in general terms; and God’s orders are issued to the Persians and Medes to set forth upon the expedition which he has given them in charge. Upon this the prophet enters into the midst of the action; and in the person of Babylon expresses, in the strongest terms, the astonishment and horror that seizes her on the sudden surprise of the city, at the very season dedicated to pleasure and festivity. Then, in his own person, he describes the situation of things there; the security of the Babylonians, and, in the midst of their feasting, the sudden alarm of war. The event is then declared in a very singular manner. God orders the prophet to set a watchman to look out, and to report what he sees; he sees two companies marching onward, representing, by their appearance, the two nations that were to execute God’s orders; who declare that Babylon is fallen.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">As whirlwinds in the south, </span>&c. — Bishop Lowth’s translation of this passage gives it a peculiar force and elegance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Like the southern tempests, violently rushing along, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the desert he cometh, from the terrible country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A dreadful vision! it is revealed unto me:</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">The plunderer is plundered, and the destroyer is destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Go up, O Elam; from the siege, O Media! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I have put an end to all her vexations.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="ital">southern tempests, </span>or <span class="ital">whirlwinds in the south, </span>the prophet means tempests in those extensive deserts which lay southward from Judea, in which the winds rush along with great force, as meeting with no obstruction from mountains, hills, trees, or buildings. To these he compares the sweeping and irresistible ruin which, by terrible armies, was about to come on Babylon from Media and Persia, through the deserts that lay between it and those countries. “The prophet,” says Lowth, “renews his threatenings against Babylon, as he does afterward, (chap. 47.,) to convince the Jews, by this repetition, of the certainty of the event, and thereby support them under their captivity when it should come.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burden - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>).<p>Of the desert - There have been almost as many interpretations of this expression, as there have been interpreters. That it means Babylon, or the country about Babylon, there can be no doubt; but the question why this phrase was applied, has given rise to a great diversity of opinions. The term 'desert' (&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  midba&#770;r) is usually applied to a wilderness, or to a comparatively barren and uncultivated country - a place for flocks and herds (<a href="/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-9.htm">Jeremiah 9:9</a> ff); to an actual waste, sandy desert <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>; and particularly to the deserts of Arabia <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>. It may here be applied to Babylon either historically, as having been "once" an unreclaimed desert: or by "anticipation," as descriptive of what it "would be" after it should be destroyed by Cyrus, or possibly both these ideas may have been combined. That it was "once" a desert before it was reclaimed by Semiramis is the testimony of all history; that it is "now" a vast waste is the united testimony of all travelers. There is every reason to think that a large part of the country about Babylon was formerly overflowed with water "before" it was reclaimed by dykes; and as it was naturally a waste, when the artificial dykes and dams should be removed, it would again be a desert.<p>Of the sea - (&#1497;&#1501;  ya&#770;m). There has been also much difference of opinion in regard to this word. But there can be no doubt that it refers to the Euphrates, and to the extensive region of marsh that was covered by its waters. The name 'sea' (&#1497;&#1501;  ya&#770;m) is not unfrequently given to a large river, to the Nile, and to the Euphrates (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>). Herodotus (i. 184), says, that 'Semiramis confined the Euphrates within its channel by raisin great dams against it; for before, it overflowed the whole country like a sea.' And Abydenus, in Eusebius, ("Prepara. Evang.," ix. 457) says, respecting the building of Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, that 'it is reported that all this was covered with water, and was called a sea - &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  legetai de panta men ech arche&#772;s hudo&#772;r einai, thalasso&#772;n kaloumene&#772;n (Compare Strabo, "Geog." xvi. 9, 10; and Arrianus, "De Expedit.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>, the whirlwind is represented as coming 'from the wilderness; that is, from the "desert" of Arabia (compare <a href="/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>So it cometh from the desert - (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>, and the note on that place).

That this is a prophecy of the destruction of Babylon is clear from the express mention both of the Medes and Persians, by whom it should be, and of Babylon itself, and its fall, <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a> which, though prophesied of before, is here repeated, partly for the certainty of it, and partly for the comfort of the people of the Jews, who would be captives in it, and so break off and prevent their confidence in a nation that would be ruined; and perhaps this prophecy might be delivered out about the time or on account of Merodach king of Babylon sending letters and a present to Hezekiah, who showed to his messengers all his treasures. Babylon is here called "the desert of the sea", not because it was a desert land, for it was a very fruitful one; or because it would be laid desolate, and become as a wilderness; but either because there was one between that and the countries of Media and Persia, as Kimchi, from whence its destroyers would come; or rather, because it was, as the word may be rendered, a "plain", for so the land of Chaldea was, and the city of Babylon particularly was built in a plain, <a href="/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a> and because this country abounded with pools and lakes, which with the Hebrews are called seas; and especially since the city of Babylon was situated by the river Euphrates, which ran about it, and through it and which therefore is said to dwell upon many waters, <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a> hence it has this name of the desert of the sea; besides, Abydenus (l), from Megasthenes, informs us, that all the places about Babylon were from the beginning water, and were called a sea; and it should be observed that mystical Babylon is represented by a woman in a desert, sitting on many waters, which are interpreted of a multitude of people and nations, <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a> and some here by "sea" understand the multitude of its riches, power, and people.

In the majority of cases they are to be explained as catchwords, taken from the body of the oracle (in this instance the fourth word of the original, “desert”). Similarly David’s lament over Saul and Jonathan is entitled the song of “the bow,” <a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm" title="(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)">2 Samuel 1:18</a>, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/21-22.htm" title="These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.">2 Samuel 21:22</a></span>. The words “of the sea” are wanting in the LXX. Some render “deserts” (reading <span class="ital">midbarîm</span> for <span class="ital">midbar-yâm</span>). Others, again, regard the fuller form as an emblematic designation of Babylon or Babylonia: the country that was once a sea (<span class="greekheb">θάλασσα</span> Herod. i. 184) and shall be so again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the south</span>] Lit. “in the Negeb,” the dry pastoral region in the south of Judah and beyond.

This is a short and somewhat vague, but highly poetic, "burden of Babylon" It is probably an earlier prophecy than <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. and 14, and perhaps the first revelation made to Isaiah with respect to the fall of the great Chaldean capital. It exhibits no consciousness of the fact that Babylon is Judah's predestined destroyer, and is expressive rather of sympathy (vers. 3, 4) than of triumph. Among recent critics, some suppose it to refer to Sargon's capture of the city in  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>; but the objection to this view, from the entire absence of all reference to Assyria as the conquering power, and the mention of "Elam" and "Media" in her place, is absolutely fatal to it. There can be no reasonable doubt that the same siege is intended as in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, where also Media is mentioned (ver. 17); and there are no real grounds for questioning that the event of which the prophet is made cognizant is that siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus the Great which destroyed the Babylonian empire. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The desert of the sea</span>. The Isaianic authorship of this title is doubtful, since "the desert of the sea" is an expression elsewhere wholly unknown to biblical writers. Some regard "the sea" as the Euphrates, in which case "the desert of the sea" may be the waste tract west of the Euphrates, extending thence to the eastern borders of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">As whirlwinds in the south pass through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as whirlwinds in the south country</span>, <span class="accented">sweeping along</span>. The "south country" is that immediately to the south of Judaea. Its liability to whirlwinds is noticed in <a href="/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a> and in <a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a> (compare Major Palmer's 'Sinai,' p. 33). <span class="cmt_word">It cometh</span>. What cometh? Dr. Kay says, "God's visitation;" Rosenm&uuml;ller, "a numerous army." But is it not rather the "grievous vision" of the next verse? <span class="cmt_word">From the desert.</span> The <span class="accented">great</span> desert bounding Palestine on the east - a truly "terrible land." Across this, as coming from Baby-Ionia to Palestine, seemed to rush the vision which it was given to the prophet to see. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This section, commencing in the form of historic prose, introduces itself thus: "In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, Sargon the king of Asshur having sent him (and he made war against Ashdod, and captured it): at that time Jehovah spake through Yeshayahu the son of Amoz as follows," i.e., He communicated the following revelation through the medium of Isaiah (b'yad, as in <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>, and many other passages). The revelation itself was attached to a symbolical act. B'yad (lit. "by the hand of") refers to what was about to be made known through the prophet by means of the command that was given him; in other words, to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>, and indirectly to <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>. Tartan (probably the same man) is met with in <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a> as the chief captain of Sennacherib. No Assyrian king of the name of Sargon is mentioned anywhere else in the Old Testament; but it may now be accepted as an established result of the researches which have been made, that Sargon was the successor of Shalmanassar, and that Shalmaneser (Shalman, <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, are the names of the four Assyrian kings who were mixed up with the closing history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It was Longperrier who was the first to establish the identity of the monarch who built the palaces at Khorsabad, which form the north-eastern corner of ancient Nineveh, with the Sargon of the Bible. We are now acquainted with a considerable number of brick, harem, votive-table, and other inscriptions which bear the name of this king, and contain all kinds of testimony concerning himself.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Expdition, i.-328-350, and the picture of Sargon in his war-chariot in Rawlinson's Five Great Monarchies, i. 368; compare also p. 304 (prisoners taken by Sargon), p. 352 (the plan of his palace), p. 483 (a glass vessel with his name), and many other engravings in vol. ii.)<p>It was he, not Shalmanassar, who took Samaria after a three years' siege; and in the annalistic inscription he boasts of having conquered the city, and removed the house of Omri to Assyria. Oppert is right in calling attention to the fact, that in <a href="/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a> the conquest is not attributed to Shalmanassar himself, but to the army. Shalmanassar died in front of Samaria; and Sargon not only put himself at the head of the army, but seized upon the throne, in which he succeeded in establishing himself, after a contest of several years' duration with the legitimate heirs and their party. He was therefore a usurper.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Les Inscriptions Assyriennes des Sargonides et les Fastes de Ninive (Versailles, 1862), and Rawlinson (vol. ii. 406ff.), who here agrees with Oppert in all essential points. Consequently there can no longer be any thought of identifying Sargon with Shalmanassar (see Brandis, Ueber den historischen Gewinn aus der Entzifferung der assyr. Inschriften, 1856, p. 48ff.). Rawlinson himself at first thought they were the same person (vid., Journal of the Asiatic Society, xii. 2, 419), until gradually the evidence increased that Sargon and Shalmanassar were the names of two different kings, although no independent inscription of the latter, the actual besieger of Samaria, has yet been found.)<p>Whether his name as it appears on the inscriptions is Sar-kin or not, and whether it signifies the king de facto as distinguished from the king de jure, we will not attempt to determine now.<p>(Note: Hitzig ventures a derivation of the name from the Zend; and Grotefend compares it with the Chaldee Sa&#770;re&#772;k, <a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a> (in his Abhandlung ber Anlage und Zerstrung der Gebude von Nimrud, 1851).)<p>This Sargon, the founder of a new Assyrian dynasty, who reigned from 721-702 (according to Oppert), and for whom there is at all events plenty of room between 721-20 and the commencement of Sennacherib's reign, first of all blockaded Tyre for five years after the fall of Samaria, or rather brought to an end the siege of Tyre which had been begun by Shalmanassar (Jos. Ant. ix. 14, 2), though whether it was to a successful end or not is quite uncertain. He then pursued with all the greater energy his plan for following up the conquest of Samaria with the subjugation of Egypt, which was constantly threatening the possessions of Assyria in western Asia, either by instigation or support. The attack upon Ashdod was simply a means to this end. As the Philistines were led to join Egypt, not only by their situation, but probably by kinship of tribe as well, the conquest of Ashdod - a fortress so strong, that, according to Herodotus (ii. 157), Psammetichus besieged it for twenty-nine years - was an indispensable preliminary to the expedition against Egypt. When Alexander the Great marched against Egypt, he had to do the same with Gaza. How long Tartan required is not to be gathered from <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>. But if he conquered it as quickly as Alexander conquered Gaza - viz. in five months - it is impossible to understand why the following prophecy should defer for three years the subjugation of Ethiopia and Egypt. The words, "and fought against Ashdod, and took it," must therefore be taken as anticipatory and parenthetical.<p>It was not after the conquest of Ashdod, but in the year in which the siege commenced, that Isaiah received the following admonition: "Go and loosen the smock-frock from off thy loins, and take off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, went stripped and barefooted." We see from this that Isaiah was clothed in the same manner as Elijah, who wore a fur coat (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>, cf., <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>), and John the Baptist, who had a garment of camel hair and a leather girdle round it (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>); for sak is a coarse linen or hairy overcoat of a dark colour (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/50-3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>), such as was worn by mourners, either next to the skin (&#8219;al-habba&#770;sa&#770;r, <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>) or over the tunic, in either case being fastened by a girdle on account of its want of shape, for which reason the verb cha&#770;gar is the word commonly used to signify the putting on of such a garment, instead of la&#770;bash. The use of the word a&#770;ro&#772;m does not prove that the former was the case in this instance (see, on the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm">2 Samuel 6:20</a>, compared with <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> and <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). With the great importance attached to the clothing in the East, where the feelings upon this point are peculiarly sensitive and modest, a person was looked upon as stripped and naked if he had only taken off his upper garment. What Isaiah was directed to do, therefore, was simply opposed to common custom, and not to moral decency. He was to lay aside the dress of a mourner and preacher of repentance, and to have nothing on but his tunic (cetoneth); and in this, as well as barefooted, he was to show himself in public. This was the costume of a man who had been robbed and disgraced, or else of a beggar or prisoner of war. The word ce&#772;n (so) is followed by the inf. abs., which develops the meaning, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. </body></html>
