These people lived in tents, and were a wandering tribe, and it is not possible to fix the precise place of their habitation. They resided, it is supposed, in the south part of Arabia Deserts, and the north part of Arabia Petrea.

The time is to be reckoned from the delivery of this prophecy; and so the calamity predicted was brought upon them by the Assyrians, perhaps under Sennacherib, when he invaded the cities of Judah, and might take Arabia in his way; less time is allowed than was the Moabites, who suffered by the same hand; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>, <p>and all the glory of Kedar shall fail; these were another sort of Arabians, as the Targum calls them: they descended from Kedar, a son of Ishmael, <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> their "glory" were their multitude, their riches and substance, and which chiefly lay in their flocks; for the sake of which they moved from place to place for pasture, and dwelled in tents, which they carried with them, and pitched where it was most convenient for them; hence they were called Scenites; see <a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thus hath the Lord said to me, Within a year, <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> according to the years of an <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</span><p>(t) He appoints them respite for one year only, and then they would be destroyed.<p>(u) Read Isa 16:14.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">according to the years of a hireling</span>] See on <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm" title="But now the LORD has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.">Isaiah 16:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Kedar</span>] a tribe of pastoral nomads (<a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm" title="Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:21</a>) in the Syrian desert (<a href="/jeremiah/2-10.htm" title="For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.">Jeremiah 2:10</a>), is here apparently a comprehensive designation of the north Arabian tribes (cf. <a href="/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/120-5.htm" title="Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!">Psalm 120:5</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Within a year, according to the years of an hireling</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 16:14). <span class="cmt_word">All the glory of Kedar shall fail</span>. "Kedar" is a name of greater note than either Dedan or Tome. It seems to be used here as inclusive of Dedan, perhaps as a designation of the northern Arabians generally. The people of Kedar, like those of Dedan, carried on trade with Tyro (<a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>). They dwelt partly in tents (<a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>), partly in villages (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>), and were rich in flocks and herds and in camels. Though not mentioned in the inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib, or Esarhaddon, the contemporaries of Isaiah, they hold a prominent place in those of Esarhaddon's son and successor, Asshurbanipal, with whom they carried on a war of some considerable duration in conjunction with the Nabathaeans (G.

"O thou my threshing, and child of my threshing-floor! What I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you." Threshing (du&#772;sh) is a figure used to represent crushing oppression in <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12-13</a>; and judicial visitation in <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a> (a parallel by which we must not allow ourselves to be misled, as Jeremiah has there given a different turn to Isaiah's figure, as he very frequently does); and again, as in the present instance, chastising plagues, in which wrath and good intention are mingled together. Israel, placed as it was under the tyrannical supremacy of the imperial power, is called the medu&#774;ssha&#770;h (for medu&#772;shah, i.e., the threshing) of Jehovah - in other words, the corn threshed by Him; also His "child of the threshing-floor," inasmuch as it was laid in the floor, in the bosom as it were of the threshing-place, to come out threshed (and then to become a thresher itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12-13</a>). This floor, in which Jehovah makes a judicial separation of grains and husks in Israel, was their captivity. Babylon is the instrument of the threshing wrath of God. But love also takes part in the threshing, and restrains the wrath. This is what the prophet has learned in the vision ("I have heard," as in <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>) - a consolatory figure for the threshing-corn in the floor, i.e., for Israel, which was now subject to the power of the world, and had been mowed off its own field and carried captive into Babylonia. </body></html>
