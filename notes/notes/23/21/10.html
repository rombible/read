The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O my threshing - The words 'to thresh,' 'to tread down,' etc., are often used in the Scriptures to denote punishments inflicted on the enemies of God. An expression likes this occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>, in describing the destruction of Babylon: 'The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor; it is time to thresh her.' In regard to the mode of threshing among the Hebrews, and the pertinency of this image to the destruction of the enemies of God, see the note at <a href="/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>. Lowth, together with many others, refers this to Babylon, and regards it as an address of God to Babylon in the midst of her punishment: 'O thou, the object on which I shall exercise the severity of my discipline; that shall lie under my afflicting hand like grain spread out upon the floor to be threshed out and winnowed, to separate the chaff from the wheat.' But the expression can be applied with more propriety to the Jews; and may be regarded as the language of "tenderness" addressed by God through the prophet to his people when they should be oppressed and broken down in Babylon: 'O thou, my people, who hast been afflicted and crushed; who hast been under my chastening hand, and reduced to these calamities on account of your sins; hear what God has spoken respecting the destruction of Babylon, and your consequent certain deliverance.' Thus it is the language of consolation; and is designed, like the prophecies in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>; 14, to comfort the Jews, when they should be in Babylon, with the certainty that they would be delivered. The language of "tenderness" in which the address is couched, as well as the connection, seems to demand this interpretation.<p>And the corn of my floor - Hebrew, 'The son of my threshing floor' - a Hebraism for grain that was on the floor to be threshed. The word 'son' is often used in this special manner among the Hebrews (see the note at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>That which I have heard ... - This shows the scope or design of the whole prophecy - to declare to the Jews the destruction that would come upon Babylon, and their own consequent deliverance. It was important that they should be "assured" of that deliverance, and hence, Isaiah "repeats" his predictions, and minutely states the manner in which their rescue would be accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. my threshing&#8212;that is, my people (the Jews) trodden down by Babylon.<p>corn of my floor&#8212;Hebrew, "my son of the floor," that is, my people, treated as corn laid on the floor for threshing; implying, too, that by affliction, a remnant (grain) would be separated from the ungodly (chaff) [Maurer]. Horsley translates, "O thou object of my unremitting prophetic pains." See Isa 28:27, 28. Some, from Jer 51:33, make Babylon the object of the threshing; but Isaiah is plainly addressing his countrymen, as the next words show, not the Babylonians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Threshing</span> is here put for the corn threshed, as it is explained in the following words; the act being frequently put for the object, as <span class="ital">captivity</span> for the captives, <span class="ital">fear</span> for the thing feared, &c., as hath been noted before. And the corn threshed is here metaphorically put for people sorely afflicted and punished, which is oft expressed by threshing, as <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a> 41:15 <a href="/micah/4-13.htm" title="Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass: and you shall beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain to the LORD, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.">Micah 4:13</a></span>, &c. This is spoken either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the Jews, to whom he now turneth his speech, whom God did grievously thresh and afflict by the Babylonians, and whom he here comforts with these tidings, as if he had said, Though thou wilt be threshed first, yet Babylon shall be threshed last, and most dreadfully, and their threshing shall be thy deliverance. This interpretation is thought necessary, because of the latter clause of the verse, wherewith this is to be joined. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O my threshing; </span> or, thou art my threshing, whom I have undertaken to thresh and punish. And so this is fitly mentioned here, to assure them that this prophecy of Babylon’s fall must necessarily be accomplished, because the Almighty was engaged in the work. And this interpretation seems not to be inconsistent with the rest of the verse, as we shall see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The corn of my floor; </span> the corn which I will cause to be threshed upon the floor, Heb. <span class="ital">the son of my floor</span>.

Her chastisements have long been "threshing" Israel, separating the grain from the chaff, and will do so still more as time goes on. The prophet's message is for the comfort of those who shall have gone through the process and become the true "children of the threshing-floor"  - pure wheat, fit to be gathered into the garner of God (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here again, as in the case of the prophecy concerning Moab, what the prophet has given to him to see does not pass without exciting his feelings of humanity, but works upon him like a horrible dream. "Therefore are my loins full of cramp: pangs have taken hold of me, as the pangs of a travailing woman: I twist myself, so that I do not hear; I am brought down with fear, so that I do not see. My heart beats wildly; horror hath troubled me: the darkness of night that I love, he hath turned for me into quaking." The prophet does not describe in detail what he saw; but the violent agitation produced by the impression leads us to conclude how horrible it must have been. Chalcha&#770;la&#770;h is the contortion produced by cramp, as in <a href="/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>; tzirim is the word properly applied to the pains of childbirth; na&#8219;ava&#770;h means to bend, or bow one's self, and is also used to denote a convulsive utterance of pain; ta&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h, which is used in a different sense from <a href="/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10</a> (compare, however, <a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>), denotes a feverish and irregular beating of the pulse. The darkness of evening and night, which the prophet loved so much (che&#772;shek, a desire arising from inclination, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>), and always longed for, either that he might give himself up to contemplation, or that he might rest from outward and inward labour, had bee changed into quaking by the horrible vision. It is quite impossible to imagine, as Umbreit suggests, that nesheph chishki (the darkness of my pleasure) refers to the nocturnal feast during which Babylon was stormed (Herod. i. 191, and Xenophon, Cyrop. vii. 23). </body></html>
