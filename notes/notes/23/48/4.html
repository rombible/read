They prided themselves respecting Jerusalem and the temple, yet there was no holiness in their lives. If we are not sincere in religion, we do but take the name of the Lord in vain. By prophecy they were shown how God would deal with them, long before it came to pass. God has said and done enough to prevent men's boasting of themselves, which makes the sin and ruin of the proud worse; sooner or later every mouth shall be stopped, and all become silent before Him. We are all born children of disobedience. Where original sin is, actual sin will follow. Does not the conscience of every man witness to the truth of Scripture? May the Lord prove us, and render us doers of the word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because I knew that thou art obstinate - I made these frequent predictions, and fulfilled them in this striking manner, because I knew that as a people, you were prone to unbelief, and in order that you might have the most full and undoubted demonstration of the truth of what was declared. As they were disinclined to credit his promises, and as he saw that in their long captivity they would be prone to disbelieve what he had said respecting their deliverance under Cyrus, he had, therefore, given them these numerous evidences of the certainty of the fulfillment of all his prophecies, in order that their minds might credit what he said about their return to their own land.<p>That thou art obstinate - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Hard,' The sense is, that they were obstinate and intractable - an expression probably taken from a bullock which refuses to receive the yoke. The word hard, as expressive of obstinacy, is often combined with others. Thus, in <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>, 'hard of neck,' that is, stiff-necked, stubborn; 'hard of face' <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>; 'hard of heart' <a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>. The idea is, that they were, as a people, obstinate, rebellious, and indisposed to submit to the laws of God - a charge which is often brought against them by the sacred writers, and which is abundantly verified by all their history as a people (compare <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3-5</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6-13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-27.htm">Deuteronomy 31:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>Thy neck is an iron sinew - The word &#1490;&#1497;&#1491;  giyd means properly a cord, thong, or band; then a nerve, sinew, muscle, or tendon.

But &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; is favoured by the form Almanach (Hebr. &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1511;, see Steinschneider, Catal. Codd. Lugduno-Batav. p. 370), in which the word was afterwards adopted as the name of an astrological handbook or year-book. In Arabic the word appears to me to be equivalent to 'l-mna&#770;ch, the encampment (of the stars); but to all appearance it was originally an Egyptian word, and possibly the Coptic monk (old Egyptian mench), a form or thing formed, is hidden beneath it.<p><a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>Then follows the concluding strophe, which, like the first, announces to the imperial city in a triumphantly sarcastic tone its inevitable fate; whereas the intermediate strophes refer rather to the sins by which this fate has been brought upon it. "Come near, then, with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy witchcrafts, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth: perhaps thou canst profit, perhaps thou wilt inspire terror. Thou art wearied through the multitude of thy consultations; let the dissectors of the heavens come near, then, and save thee, the star-gazers, they who with every new moon bring things to light that will come upon thee. Behold, they have become like stubble: fire has consumed them: there is not a red-hot coal to warm themselves, a hearth-fire to sit before. So is it with thy people, for whom thou hast laboured: thy partners in trade from thy youth, they wander away every one in his own direction; no one who brings salvation to thee." Hitzig and others adopt the simple rendering, "Persevere, then, with thine enchantments." It is indeed true, that in <a href="/leviticus/13-5.htm">Leviticus 13:5</a> &#1489;&#1468; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; signifies "to remain standing by anything," i.e., to persevere with it, just as in <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a> it signifies to keep one's standing in anything; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>, to enter upon anything; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>, to engage in anything; but there is no reason for taking it here in any other sense than in <a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>. Babylon is to draw near with all the processes of the black art, wherein &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, according to our western mode of expression, equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Ges. 123, 2*) it had been addicted to abundance of routine from its youth upwards (&#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; with an auxiliary pathach for &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;); possibly it may be of some use, possibly it will terrify, i.e., make itself so terrible to the approaching calamity, as to cause it to keep off. The prophet now sees in spirit how Babylon draws near, and how it also harasses itself to no purpose; he therefore follows up the &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, addressed in pleno to Babylon, with a second challenge commencing with &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;. Their astrologers are to draw near, and try that power over the future to which they lay claim, by bringing it to bear at once upon the approaching destruction for the benefit of Babylon. &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; is a singular form connected with a feminine plural suffix, such as we find in <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35-11.htm">Ezekiel 35:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a>, connected with a masculine plural suffix. Assuming the correctness of the vowel-pointing, the singular appears in such cases as these to have a collective meaning, like the Arabic pl. fractus; for there is no ground to suppose that the Aramaean plural form &#8219;e&#772;tsa&#770;th is used here in the place of the Hebrew. Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; (which would be equivalent to &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488;, the keri reads &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, cutters up of the heavens, i.e., planners or dissectors of them, from ha&#770;b, dissecare, resecare (compare the rabbinical habha&#770;ra&#770;h, a syllable, i.e., segmentum vocabuli, and possibly also the talmudic 'e&#772;bha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, limbs of a body). The correction proposed by Knobel, viz., cho&#772;bhere&#772;, from cha&#770;bha&#772;r, to know, or be versed in, is unnecessary. Cha&#770;za&#770;h b' signifies here, as it generally does, to look with pleasure or with interest at anything; hence Luther has rendered it correctly, die Sternkucker (Eng. ver. star-gazers). They are described still further as those who make known with every new moon (lecho&#774;da&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m, like labbeqa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, every morning, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>, etc.), things which, etc. &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used in a partitive sense: out of the great mass of events they select the most important, and prepare a calendar or almanack (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769; in Plutarch) for the state every month. But these very wise men cannot save themselves, to say nothing of others, out of the power of that flame, which is no comforting coal-fire to warm one's self by, no hearth-fire (<a href="/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>) to sit in front of, but a devouring, eternal, i.e., peremptory flame (<a href="/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>). The rendering adopted by Grotius, Vitringa, Lowth, Gesenius, and others, "non supererit pruna ad calendum," is a false one, if only because it is not in harmony with the figure. "Thus shall they be unto thee," he continues in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>, i.e., such things shall be endured to thy disgrace by those about whom thou hast wearied thyself (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;). The learned orders of the Chaldeans had their own quarter, and enjoyed all the distinction and privileges of a priestly caste. What follows cannot possibly be understood as relating to these masters of astrology and witchcraft, as Ewald supposes; for, according to the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>, they would be called &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;. Moreover, if they became a prey of the flames, and therefore were unable to flee, we should have to assume that they were burned while taking flight (Umbreit). &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; are those who carried on commercial intercourse with the great "trading city" (<a href="/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a>), as Berossos says, "In Babylon there was a great multitude of men of other nations who had settled in Chaldea, and they lived in disorder, like the wild beasts;" compare Aeschylus, Pers. 52-3, &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. All of these are scattered in the wildest flight, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, every one on his own side, viz., in the direction of his own home, and do not trouble themselves about Babylon. </body></html>
