It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For mine own sake - (See <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>). The expression here is repeated to denote emphasis. He had thrown them into the furnace of affliction on his own account, that is, in order that his own name should not be profaned by their irreligion and idolatry, and that the glory which was due to him should not be given to idols.<p>For how should my name be polluted? - The sense is, that it would be inconsistent with his perfections to see his name profaned without endeavoring to correct and prevent it; and in order to this, that he brought these afflictions upon them. They had profaned his name by their irreligion and hypocrisy. In order to correct this evil, and to prevent it in future, he had brought these national judgments on them, and removed them to Babylon. The doctrine here taught is, that when the conduct of God's professed people is such as to dishonor God, and to make his name a subject of reproach with the wicked, he will visit them with heavy judgments. He cannot indulge them in a course of life which will reflect dishonor on his own name.<p>And I will not give my glory unto another - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). The sense here is this. The Jews had, as a nation, been prone to ascribe to idols that which was due to God alone. To correct this, and to make an effectual reform, he had removed them to Babylon, and doomed them to a long and painful captivity there. It may be added that the punishment was effectual, and that their long trial in Babylon served entirely to correct all their idolatrous propensities as a nation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. how should my name&#8212;Maurer, instead of "My name" from Isa 48:9, supplies "My glory" from the next clause; and translates, "How (shamefully) My glory has been profaned!"

"The first I have long ago proclaimed, and it has gone forth out of my mouth, and I caused it to be heard. I carried it out suddenly, and it came to pass. Because I knew that thou art hard, and thy neck an iron clasp, and thy brow of brass; I proclaimed it to thee long ago; before it came to pass, I caused thee to hear it, that thou mightest not say, My idol has done it, and my graven image and molten image commanded it." The word &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in itself signifies simply priora; and then, according to the context, it signifies prius facta (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>), or prius praedicta (<a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>), or prius eventura (<a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>). In the present passage it refers to earlier occurrences, which Jehovah had foretold, and, when the time fixed for their accomplishment arrived, which He had immediately brought to pass. With a retrospective glance at this, we find plural masc. suffixes (cf., <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>) used interchangeably with plural fem. (cf., <a href="/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>); the prophet more frequently uses the sing. fem. in this neuter sense (<a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a>, etc.), and also, though very rarely, the sing. masc. (<a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). On g&#305;&#772;d, a band, a sinew, but here a clasp (cf., Arab. kaid, a fetter), see Psychology, p. 233. Nechu&#772;sha&#770;h is a poetical equivalent for necho&#772;sheth, as in <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>. The heathen cravings of Israel, which reached into the captivity, are here presupposed. Hengstenberg is mistaken in his supposition, that the prophet's standpoint is always anterior to the captivity when he speaks in condemnation of idolatry. We cannot draw any conclusion from the character of the community that returned, with regard to that of the people of the captivity generally. The great mass even of Judah, and still more of Israel, remained behind, and became absorbed into the heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated. And does not Ezekiel expressly state in <a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>., that the golah by the Chaboras defiled themselves with the same abominations of idolatry as their fathers, and that the prevailing disposition was to combine the worship of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether for the latter? And we know that it was just the same with the exiles in Egypt, among whom the life and labours of Jeremiah terminated. Wherever the prophet speaks of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, these names invariably include a tendency or falling away to Babylonian idolatry, to which he describes the exiles as having been addicted, both in <a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a> and elsewhere. </body></html>
