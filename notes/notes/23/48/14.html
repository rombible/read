It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All ye, assemble yourselves and hear - Ye Jews who are in Babylon, gather together, and listen to the assurance that God is able to protect you, and that he will certainly restore you to your own country.<p>Which among them - Who among the pagan?<p>Hath declared these things? - The things relating to the destruction of Babylon, and the rescue of his people. This is an appeal similar to that which God has often made, that he alone can predict future events. None of the astrologers, soothsayers, or diviners of Babylon had been able to foretell the expedition and the conquests of Cyrus, and the capture of the city. If they had been able to foresee the danger, they might have guarded against it, and the city might have been saved. But God had predieted it a hundred and fifty years before it occurred, and this demonstrated, therefore, that he alone was God.<p>The Lord hath loved him - Lowth renders this, 'He whom Jehovah hath loved will execute his will on Babylon.' The Septuagint renders it, 'Loving thee, I will execute thy will against Babylon.' There can be no doubt that it refers to Cyrus, and that the meaning is, that he whom Yahweh had loved would accomplish his will on Babylon. It does not necessarily mean that Yahweh was pleased with his moral character, or that he was a pious man (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>); but that he was so well pleased with him as an instrument to accomplish his purposes, that he chose to employ him for that end.<p>He will do his pleasure on Babylon - He will accomplish all his desire on that city; that is, he will take, and subdue it. The word 'his' here, may refer either to Cyrus or to Yahweh. Probably it means that Cyrus would do to Babylon what would be pleasing to Yahweh.<p>And his arm - The arm is a symbol of strength, and is the instrument by which we execute our purposes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. among them&#8212;among the gods and astrologers of the Chaldees (Isa 41:22; 43:9; 44:7).<p>Lord &#8230; loved him; he will, &c.&#8212;that is, "He whom the Lord hath loved will do," &c.

The Lord hath loved him, to wit, Cyrus, who might easily be understood out of the foregoing context, in which he is frequently mentioned. The pronoun is put for the noun, as is usual both in Scripture and in other authors. Now God loved Cyrus, not with a special, and everlasting, and complacential love, for he was a heathen, and had some great vices as well as virtues; but with that general love and kindness which God hath for all his creatures, as is observed, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/145-9.htm" title="The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.">Psalm 145:9</a></span>; and moreover with that particular kind of love which God hath for such men as excel others in any virtues, as Cyrus did; in which sense Christ loved the young man, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a></span>; and with a love of good-will and beneficence. God had such a kindness for him, as to make him a most glorious and victorious general and king, and the great instrument for the deliverance of his own people; which was a singular honour and advantage to him, and might have been far greater, and extended to the eternal salvation of his soul, if he had not wanted a heart to use the price which God hereby put into his hand. And as anger being ascribed to God is not meant of the affection, for such passions are inconsistent with the perfection of God’s nature, but of the effect; so the love of God, when it is applied in Scripture to such persons as Cyrus, is not so much to be understood of an inward affection, as of the outward effects of it; and so this love is explained in the following words, by that prosperous success which God gave him against the Chaldeans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He will do his pleasure on Babylon; </span> Cyrus shall execute that I have appointed him to do for the destruction of Babylon, and for the redemption of my people; which was in itself a good work; and therefore this is added as the reason why God loved him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His arm shall be on the Chaldeans; </span> he shall smite and subdue them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All ye assemble yourselves, and hear,....

It had not been previously declared in so many words that Jehovah "loved" Cyrus; but it had been sufficiently indicated by the way in which he was spoken of in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and Isaiah 45:1-5. God "loves" all who "in an honest and good heart" seek according to their lights to do his will and serve him faithfully. Nebuchadnezzar is called his "servant" (<a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18, 20</a>), Cyrus (in <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>) his "anointed."

The Hebrew is very harsh, and perhaps requires emendation; but the meaning can scarcely be other than that expressed in our version. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But in order to determine exactly what "the former things" were, which Jehovah had foretold in order that Israel might not ascribe them to this idol or the other, we must add <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6-8</a> : "Thou hast heard it, look then at it all; and ye, must ye not confess it? I give thee new things to hear from this time forth, and hidden things, and what thou didst not know. It is created now, and not long ago; and thou hast not heard it before, that thou mightest not say, Behold, I knew it. Thou hast neither heard it, nor known it, nor did thine ear open itself to it long ago: for I knew thou art altogether faithless, and thou art called rebellious from the womb." The meaning of the question in <a href="/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6</a> is very obvious: they must acknowledge and attest, even thou against their will (<a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>), that Jehovah has foretold all that is now confirmed by the evident fulfilment. Consequently the "former things" are the events experienced by the people from the very earliest times (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>) down to the present times of Cyrus, and more especially the first half or epoch of this period itself, which expired at the time that formed the prophet's standpoint. And as the object of the prediction was to guard Israel against ascribing to its idols that which had taken place (which can only be understood of events that had occurred in favour of Israel), the "former things" must include the preparation for the redemption of Israel from the Babylonian captivity through the revolution brought to pass by Cyrus. Hence the "new things" will embrace the redemption of Israel with its attendant circumstances, and that not merely on its outward side, but on its spiritual side as well; also the glorification of the redeemed people in the midst of a world of nations converted to the God of Israel, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth; in short, the New Testament aeon (compare &#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>), with the facts which contribute to its ultimate completion (f. <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>). The announcement and realization of these absolutely new and hitherto secret things (cf., <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>) take place from this time forward; Israel has not heard of them "before today" (compare &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, "from this day forward," <a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>), that it may not lay claim to the knowledge conveyed to it by prophecy, as something drawn from itself. This thought is carried to a climax in <a href="/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a> in three correlated sentences commencing with "yea" (gam). &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; signifies patescere here, as in <a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a> (Ewald, 120, a). Jehovah had said nothing to them of this before, because it was to be feared that, with their faithlessness and tendency to idolatry, which had run through their entire history, they would only abuse it. This is strange! On the one hand, the rise of Cyrus is spoken of here as predicted from of old, because it belonged to the "former things," and as knowable through prophecy - a statement which favours the opinion that these addresses were written before the captivity; and, on the other hand, a distinction is drawn between these "former things" and certain "new things" that were intentionally not predicted before the expiration of these "former things," which certainly seems to preclude the possibility of their having been composed before the captivity; since, as Ruetschi observes, if "the older Isaiah had predicted this, he would have acted in direct opposition to Jehovah's design." But in actual fact, the dilemma in which the opponents of the authenticity of these prophecies find themselves, is comparatively worse than this. For the principal objection - namely, that a prophet before the captivity could not possibly have known or predicted anything concerning Cyrus - cannot be satisfactorily removed by attributing these prophecies to a prophet of the time of the captivity, since they expressly and repeatedly affirm that the rise of Cyrus was an event foreknown and predicted by the God of prophecy. Now, if it is Isaiah who thus takes his stand directly in the midst of the captivity, we can understand both of these: viz., the retrospective glance at previous prophecies, which issued in the rise of Cyrus that prepared the way for the redemption from Babylon, since, so far as the prophet was concerned, such prophecies as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13-14</a>:23; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1-10</a>, and also <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10-12</a> (<a href="/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>), are fused into one with his present predictions; and also the prospective glance at prophecies which are now first to be uttered, and events which are now fore the first time about to be accomplished; inasmuch as the revelations contained in these prophecies concerning Israel's pathway through suffering to glory, more especially so far as they grew out of the idea of the "servant of Jehovah," might really be set down as absolutely new to the prophet himself, and never heard of before. Meanwhile our exposition is not affected by the critical question; for even we most firmly maintain, that the prophet who is speaking here has his standpoint in the midst of the captivity, on the boundary line of the condition of suffering and punishment and its approaching termination. </body></html>
