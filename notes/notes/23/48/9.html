It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For my name's sake - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>). It is possible that the design of this verse may be, to answer an objection. 'If the character of the nation is such, it might be said, 'why should God desire to restore them again to their own land? If their sins have been so great as to make these heavy judgments proper, why not suffer them to remain under the infliction of the deserved judgment? Why should God interpose? why raise up Cyrus? why overthrow Babylon? why conduct them across a pathless wilderness, and provide for them in a sandy desert?' To this the answer is, that it was not on their account. It was not because they were deserving of his favor, nor was it primarily and mainly in order that they might be happy. It was on his own account - in order to show his covenant faithfulness; his fidelity to the promises made to their fathers, his mercy, his compassion, his readiness to pardon, and his unchanging love. And this is the reason why he 'defers his anger,' in relation to any of the children of people. His own glory, and not their happiness, is the main object in view. And this is right. The glory, the honor, and the happiness of God, are of more importance than the welfare of any of his creatures; because, first, they are in themselves of more importance, just in proportion as God is more elevated than any of his creatures; and, secondly, the welfare of any or all of his creatures depends on the maintaining of the honor of God, and of his government, and on the manifestation of his perfections to the universe (see the treatise of President Edwards on The end for which God created the world, in Works, vol. iii. New York Ed. 1830).<p>Will I defer mine anger - That is, I will spare you, and restore you again to your own land (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>).<p>And for my praise will I refrain for thee - Will I refrain my anger in reference to you as a nation. The word used here (&#1495;&#1496;&#1501;  cha&#770;t&#803;am) denotes properly to muzzle, and is commonly employed with reference to an animal in order to tame or subdue it. Here it means that God would restrain himself; He would not put forth His anger in order to destroy them. Learn hence:<p>1. That God acts with reference to his own glory, in order to manifest his own perfections, and to secure his praise.<p>2. That the reason why the wicked are not cut off sooner in their transgressions is, that He may show his forbearance, and secure praise by long-suffering.<p>3. That the reason why the righteous are kept amidst their frequent failures in duty, their unfaithfulness, and their many imperfections, is, that God may get glory by showing his covenant fidelity.<p>4. That it is one evidence of piety - and one that is indispensable - that there should be a willingness thai God should secure his own glory in his own way, and that there should be a constant desire that his praise should be promoted, whatever may befall his creatures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. refrain&#8212;literally, "muzzle"; His wrath, after the return, was to be restrained a while, and then, because of their sins, let loose again (Ps 78:38).<p>for thee&#8212;that is, mine anger towards thee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger:</span> and although thou dost justly deserve my hottest anger and most dreadful judgments, which also, if thou repentest not, I will in due time inflict; yet at present I will spare thee, and deliver thee out of captivity, not for thy sake, be it known to thee, but merely for my own sake, and for the vindication of my name and glory, as it follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm" title="For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.">Isaiah 48:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For my praise; </span> that I may be praised and magnified for my power, faithfulness, and goodness, and other perfections. <span class="ital">Will I refrain</span>, to wit, mine anger; which is easily understood out of the foregoing clause. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For my name's sake will I defer mine anger,....

The above account of them shows that it was not for any merits of theirs, or any works of righteousness done by them, that he showed favour to them, as afterwards expressed; but for his own name's sake, and because of his glory; because these people were called by his name, and said to be his people, lest therefore his name should be reproached among the Heathen, or he should suffer any diminution of his glory, therefore he did not at once stir up all his wrath, as their sins deserved, but prolonged it from time to time: <p>and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off: that is, refrain mine anger from thee; or "seal" or "stop my nostrils" (c), that the smoke of his wrath and anger might not go out from thence to destroy them.

Israel's insincerity (ver. 1), obstinacy (ver. 4), addiction to idols (ver. 5), blindness (ver. 8), and general resistance to God's will (ver. 8), could not but have provoked God's "anger." He will, however, "defer" it, "refrain" himself, not "cut Israel off, <span class="accented">for his Name's sake."</span> God, having selected one nation out of all the nations of the earth to be his "peculiar people" (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), and having declared this, and supported his people by miracles in their struggles with the other nations and peoples, was, so to speak, committed to protect and defend Israel "for his Name's sake," lest his Name should be blasphemed among the Gentiles (see <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/129.htm">Psalm 129</a>:10; 106:8, etc.). He was also bound by the promises which he had made; and. still more, by the position which Israel occupied in his scheme of salvation, to allow the nation still to exist, and therefore to condone its iniquities and restrain his anger. But the dregs of the cup of vengeance were poured out at last. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this summons, and description of those who are summoned, the address of Jehovah begins. "The first I have long ago proclaimed, and it has gone forth out of my mouth, and I caused it to be heard. I carried it out suddenly, and it came to pass. Because I knew that thou art hard, and thy neck an iron clasp, and thy brow of brass; I proclaimed it to thee long ago; before it came to pass, I caused thee to hear it, that thou mightest not say, My idol has done it, and my graven image and molten image commanded it." The word &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in itself signifies simply priora; and then, according to the context, it signifies prius facta (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>), or prius praedicta (<a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>), or prius eventura (<a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>). In the present passage it refers to earlier occurrences, which Jehovah had foretold, and, when the time fixed for their accomplishment arrived, which He had immediately brought to pass. With a retrospective glance at this, we find plural masc. suffixes (cf., <a href="/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>) used interchangeably with plural fem. (cf., <a href="/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>); the prophet more frequently uses the sing. fem. in this neuter sense (<a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a>, etc.), and also, though very rarely, the sing. masc. (<a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). On g&#305;&#772;d, a band, a sinew, but here a clasp (cf., Arab. kaid, a fetter), see Psychology, p. 233. Nechu&#772;sha&#770;h is a poetical equivalent for necho&#772;sheth, as in <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>. The heathen cravings of Israel, which reached into the captivity, are here presupposed. Hengstenberg is mistaken in his supposition, that the prophet's standpoint is always anterior to the captivity when he speaks in condemnation of idolatry. We cannot draw any conclusion from the character of the community that returned, with regard to that of the people of the captivity generally. The great mass even of Judah, and still more of Israel, remained behind, and became absorbed into the heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated. And does not Ezekiel expressly state in <a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>., that the golah by the Chaboras defiled themselves with the same abominations of idolatry as their fathers, and that the prevailing disposition was to combine the worship of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether for the latter? And we know that it was just the same with the exiles in Egypt, among whom the life and labours of Jeremiah terminated. Wherever the prophet speaks of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, these names invariably include a tendency or falling away to Babylonian idolatry, to which he describes the exiles as having been addicted, both in <a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a> and elsewhere. </body></html>
