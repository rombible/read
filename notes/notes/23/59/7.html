See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their feet run to evil - In accordance with the design of the prophet to show the entireness of their depravity, he states that all their members were employed in doing evil. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3-6</a>. he had remarked that depravity had extended to their hands, their fingers, their lips, and their tongue; he here states that their feet also were employed in doing evil. Instead of treading the paths of righteousness, and hastening to execute purposes of mercy and justice, they were employed in journeyings to execute plans of iniquity. The words 'run,' and 'make haste,' are designed to intimate the intensity of their purpose to do wrong. They did not walk slowly; they did not even take time to deliberate; but such was their desire of wrong-doing, that they hastened to execute their plans of evil. People usually walk slowly and with a great deal of deliberation when any good is to be done; they walk rapidly, or they run with haste and alacrity when evil is to be accomplished. This passage is quoted by the apostle Paul <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-15.htm">Romans 3:15</a>, and is applied to the Jews of his own time as proof of the depraved character of the entire nation.<p>They make haste to shed innocent blood - No one can doubt that this was the character of the nation in the time of Manasseh (see the Introduction, Section 3). It is not improbable that the prophet refers to the bloody and cruel reign of this prince. That it was also the character of the nation when Isaiah began to prophesy is apparent from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-21</a>.<p>Their thoughts - That is, their plans and purposes are evil. It is not merely that evil is done, but they intended that it should be done. They had no plan for doing good; and they were constantly laying plans for evil.<p>Wasting - That is, violence, oppression, destruction. It means that the government was oppressive and tyrannical; and that it was the general character of the nation that they were regardless of the interests of truth and righteousness.<p>And destruction - Margin, 'Breaking.' The word commonly means breaking or breach; then a breaking down, or destruction, as of a kingdom <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a>; or of individuals <a href="/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>. Here it means that they broke down or trampled on the rights of others.<p>Are in their paths - Instead of marking their ways by deeds of benevolence and justice, they could be tracked by cruelty and blood. The path of the wicked through the earth can be seen usually by the desolations which they make. The path of conquerors can be traced by desolated fields, and smouldering ruins, and forsaken dwelling-places, and flowing blood; and the course of all the wicked can be traced by the desolations which they make in their way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. feet&#8212;All their members are active in evil; in Isa 59:3, the "hands, fingers, lips, and tongue," are specified.<p>run &#8230; haste&#8212;(Ro 3:15).

The words seem to be taken out of <a href="/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a> and are quoted with the following by the Apostle Paul, <a href="/romans/3-15.htm">Romans 3:15</a> to prove the general corruption of mankind: <p>and they make haste to shed innocent blood: in wars abroad or at home, in quarrels and riots, or through the heat of persecution; which if it does not directly touch men's lives, yet issues in the death of many that fall under the power of it; and which persecutors are very eager and hasty in the prosecution of. The phrase fitly describes their temper and conduct: <p>their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity: their thoughts are continually devising things vain and sinful in themselves, unprofitable to them, and pernicious to others: their thoughts, words, and actions being evil; their tongue, lips, hands, and feet being employed in sin, show their general depravity: <p>wasting and destruction are in their paths: they waste and destroy all they meet with in their ways, their fellow creatures and their substance; and the ways they walk in lead to ruin and destruction, which will be their portion for evermore. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/59.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/59.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity</span> (or <span class="bld">evil</span>)] corresponding to their deeds, <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/59-6.htm" title="Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.">Isaiah 59:6</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wasting and destruction</span>] as ch. <a href="/isaiah/51-19.htm" title="These two things are come to you; who shall be sorry for you? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort you?">Isaiah 51:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/60-18.htm" title="Violence shall no more be heard in your land, wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.">Isaiah 60:18</a>; an alliteration in the Hebr.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in their paths</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">in their highways</span>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-17.htm" title="The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keeps his way preserves his soul.">Proverbs 16:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7, 8</span>.

They cannot construct, their devices fall through, their "spinning" is to no purpose; but they can, in a rough and blind way, do enormous mischief. "Their feet run to evil" - rush to it at full speed - brook no delay, but hurry on into act. It is an easy thing to shed innocent blood; and those who are conscious of constructive impotence are very apt to seek compensation by doing destructive work, which at least shows that they have a power of some kind. Hence "Reigns of Terror" when revolutions are at the last gasp. The strong expressions with respect to shedding innocent blood, used here and in <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a> and 2 Kings 24:4, seem to imply something like a massacre of the more godly Israelites by the ungodly in Manasseh's time. <span class="cmt_word">Wasting and destruction</span> (compare the "destruction and misery" of <a href="/romans/3-16.htm">Romans 3:16</a>, which is a quotation of the present passage). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This second prophetic address continues the reproachful theme of the first. In the previous prophecy we found the virtues which are well-pleasing to God, and to which He promises redemption as a reward of grace, set in contrast with those false means, upon which the people rested their claim to redemption. In the prophecy before us the sins which retard redemption are still more directly exposed. "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not too short to help, nor His ear too heavy to hear; but your iniquities have become a party-wall between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear." The reason why redemption is delayed, is not that the power of Jehovah has not been sufficient for it (cf., <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>), or that He has not been aware of their desire for it, but that their iniquities (&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; with the second syllable defective) have become dividers (&#1502;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, defective), have grown into a party-wall between them and their God, and their sins (cf., <a href="/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25</a>) have hidden pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m from them. As the "hand" (ya&#770;d) in <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> is the absolute hand; so here the "face" pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m) is that face which sees everything, which is everywhere present, whether uncovered or concealed; which diffuses light when it unveils itself, and leaves darkness when it is veiled; the sight of which is blessedness, and not to see which is damnation. This absolute countenance is never to be seen in this life without a veil; but the rejection and abuse of grace make this veil a perfectly impenetrable covering. And Israel had forfeited in this way the light and sight of this countenance of God, and had raised a party-wall between itself and Him, and that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;, so that He did not hear, i.e., so that their prayer did not reach Him (<a href="/lamentations/3-44.htm">Lamentations 3:44</a>) or bring down an answer from Him. </body></html>
