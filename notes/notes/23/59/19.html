The prophet, however, may be understood as speaking of Satan, the grand enemy of God’s church, and as signifying that at what time soever he or his instruments should make violent attacks on God’s people, and should endeavour to bear down all before them, by an inundation of infidelity, impiety, and wickedness; the Spirit of God would <span class="ital">lift up his standard, </span>and call together his armies, to oppose these enemies’ progress, and subvert their cause. “There can be no doubt,” says Mr. Scott, “but the grand accomplishment of this prophecy is future: and as they, among whom iniquity so abounded, antecedent to this happy change, are spoken of as the professed people of God, and are not accused of idolatry, and as the Lord is represented as wondering that there was no intercessor among them, it is more natural to interpret it of corrupt and degenerate Protestants, than either of the Jews, who are avowed enemies to Christianity, or of Papists, who retain the worship of images, saints, and angels.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>59:16-21 This passage is connected with the following chapters. It is generally thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as the Avenger and Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede with God to turn away his wrath; none to interpose for the support of justice and truth. Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousness for his people. God will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and people plainly appear. When the enemy threatens to bear down all without control, then the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, put him to flight. He that has delivered, will still deliver. A far more glorious salvation is promised to be wrought out by the Messiah in the fulness of time, which all the prophets had in view. The Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to be our Sanctifier: thus the Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, Joh 14:16. The word of Christ will always continue in the mouths of the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be the mind of the Spirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament the progress of infidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer shall gain a complete victory even on earth, and the believer will be more than conqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So shall they fear - That is, the result of the divine interposition to punish his enemies, shall be to secure the acknowledgment of the existence and perfections of Yahweh in every part of the world. See especially the notes at <a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>.<p>When the enemy shall come in - There has been great variety in the interpretation of this passage, and it is remarkable that our translators have departed from all the ancient versions, and that the present translation differs from nearly all the modern expositions of the place. Lowth renders it:<p>When he shall come like a river straitened in his course,<p>Which a strong wind driveth along.<p>Jerome (the Vulgate) renders it, 'When he shall come as a violent river which the Spirit of the Lord (spiritus Domini, or the wind of the Lord, that is, a strong wind) drives along. The Septuagint, 'For the wrath of the Lord will come like an impetuous stream; it will come with fury.' The Chaldee, 'When they shall come who oppress, like an overflowing of the river Euphrates.' The Syriac, 'Because when the oppressor shall come as a river, the Spirit of the Lord shall humble him.' The reason of this variety of interpretation is the ambiguity of the Hebrew words which occur in the verse. The word which in our common version is rendered 'the enemy' (&#1510;&#1512;  tsa&#770;r, from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;  tsa&#770;rar, to press, compress, bind up together; intrans. to be straitened, or compressed), may mean either:<p>1. "An adversary, enemy, persecutor," synonymous with &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;  'o&#770;ye&#772;b, as in <a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; <a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; or,<p>2. "Straits, affliction" <a href="/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-11.htm">Psalm 44:11</a>; or,<p>3. "Strait, narrow" <a href="/numbers/22-26.htm">Numbers 22:26</a>; <a href="/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a>.<p>It may be, therefore, here either a noun meaning an enemy; or it maybe an adjective qualifying the word river, and then will denote a river that is closely confined within its banks, and that is urged forward by a mass of accumulating waters, or by a mighty wind. According to this, it will mean that Yahweh will come to take vengeance with the impetuosity of a river that swells and foams and is borne forward with violence in its course. The comparison of a warrior or hero with such a mighty and impetuous torrent, is exceedingly forcible and beautiful, and is not uncommon (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>). The phrase rendered 'the Spirit of the Lord' (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach yehova&#770;h), may denote 'the wind of Yahweh,' or a strong, violent, mighty wind. The appropriate signification of the word &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach, is wind, or breath; and it is well known that the name of God is often in the Scriptures used to denote that which is mighty or vast, as in the phrase, mountains of God, cedars of God, etc.<p>There is no reason why it should be here regarded as denoting 'the Spirit of God,' - the great agent of enlightening and reforming the world. It may be understood, as Lowth and others have applied it, to denote a strong and violent wind - a wind urging on a mass of waters through a compressed and straitened place, and thus increasing their impetuosity and violence. The phrase 'Spirit of God' (&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach 'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym), is used to denote a strong wind, in <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>. The word rendered in our version, 'shall lift up a standard' (&#1504;&#1505;&#1505;&#1492;  nosesa&#770;h), rendered in the margin, 'put him' to flight,' if derived from &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;  na&#772;sas, and if written with the points &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;&#1492;  na&#772;sesa&#770;h, would denote to lift up, to elevate, as a standard or banner, or anything to oppose and retard a foe. But the word is probably derived from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;  nu&#770;s, to flee, in the Piel &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;  no&#770;se&#772;s, "to impel, to cause to flee."<p>Here it means, then, that the mighty wind impels or drives on the compressed waters of the stream, and the whole passage means that Yahweh would come to deliver his people, and to prostrate his foes with the impetuosity of a violent river compressed between narrow banks, and driven on by a mighty wind. True, therefore, as it is, that when a violent enemy assails the church; when he comes in with error, with violence, and with allies, like a flood, Yahweh will rear a standard against him, and the influences of the Spirit of God may be expected to interpose to arrest the evil; yet this passage does not teach that doctrine, nor should it be so applied. It does teach that Yahweh will go forth with energy and power to defend his people and to prostrate his foes.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. More general, at what time soever the <span class="ital">devil</span> or his instruments shall make violent irruptions upon the church, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/12-15.htm" title="And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.">Revelation 12:15</a></span>; for powerful enemies invading a country are oft compared to a river. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>"</span>. It is an allusion to the overflowing of Euphrates, which by its violent inundations was wont to do much hurt and damage to the Babylonians. <span class="ital">The Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him</span>: and here again, if it be taken in the first sense, viz. against the Babylonians, then the meaning is, God himself shall as it were carry the standard in the midst of Cyrus’s army, the Medes and Persians, and that with a great deal of fury, intimated here by the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Spirit</span> of the Lord; for <span class="ital">spirit</span> is often used among the Hebrews for the passions of the soul, as anger, wrath, fury, &c.

But if in either of the other two senses, viz. with particular respect to Sennacherib, then the Spirit of the Lord, as with a blast, only shall puff him away, which was made good, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/37-7.htm" title="Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.">Isaiah 37:7</a>,36,37</span>. Or with more general reference to the violence of enemies against the church; then the meaning is, God shall make known himself to take their part and defend them, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/48-3.htm" title="God is known in her palaces for a refuge....">Psalm 48:3-5</a></span>, and cause the enemies to give back, <span class="ital">or put them to flight</span>, as in the margin, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/17-12.htm" title="Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!...">Isaiah 17:12-14</a></span>, and that without power, but by his <span class="ital">Spirit</span> alone, as easy as by a puff of wind, <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a></span>. Again, if you take this (as some learned men do) in a spiritual sense, then it notes the suddenness of the gospel’s spreading itself by the Spirit in the ministry of the apostles and evangelists, bearing down like a flood all that opposes it, the Lord Jesus Christ being lifted up in it as a banner or ensign: but this sense, though true, seems to be more forced, and as it relates to temporal deliverances, more genuine and natural: however, the prophet being about to speak of the spiritual deliverances and state of the church by Christ, he seems to slide, as it were, into it by such plain allusions and types, being to speak of it more directly in the following chapters. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/59.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun,....

Aben Ezra compares this passage with, and illustrates it by, that time of trouble which will be, such as never was since there was a nation, <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> when this will be the case, which seems to be near at hand: <p>the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him; Christ and his Gospel, or Christ the standard lifted up in the ministry of the Gospel, <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a> a set of ministers shall be raised up, having the everlasting Gospel, which they shall publish to all nations, and which shall have an universal spread; and by means of which the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea; and which will be a sufficient check to the enemy's flood of immorality, error, and persecution; and which, after this, shall be no more; see <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>.

The Targum is, <p>"they that afflict shall be as the overflowing of the river Euphrates; by the word of the Lord shall they be broken;'' <p>and Vitringa thinks there is an allusion to the river Euphrates; interpreting the enemy of the Ottoman Turks, Tartars, and Scythians, stirred up by Satan to distress the church: all this may be applied to the case of particular believers under the assaults of Satan their grand enemy; who seeks all occasions to disturb their peace and destroy their comfort, though he cannot ruin their souls; he comes in, not only into their houses where they dwell, and gives them disturbance there; and into the house of God where they worship, and does all he can to hinder them in attending on the word and ordinances, and to prevent all usefulness, edification, and comfort thereby; but he enters into their hearts, and stirs up the corruptions of their nature, and causes these to rise like a flood, which threaten with bringing them into captivity to the law of sin and death; and attacks them with violent temptations, suggesting that they are not the people of God, the redeemed of the Lamb, or regenerated by the Spirit, but are hypocrites, and never had the work of grace on their hearts; aggravating their sins, and telling them they have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost, and there is no pardon for them; and at other times filling their minds with blasphemous and atheistical thoughts; all which come upon them sometimes with so much force, that it is like an overflowing flood that threatens with utter destruction; when the Spirit of the Lord within them, who is greater than he that is in the world, lifts up Christ as an ensign or standard to them; and directs them to his blood for peace and pardon, for the cleansing of their souls and the atonement of their sins; where they may see and read, in legible characters, the free and full remission of their sins, and an entire satisfaction to the justice of God for them; and he holds up and holds out the righteousness of Christ unto them, with which God is well pleased, his justice satisfied, and his law made honourable; and by which they are justified from all things, and secured from all charges and condemnation; and who also leads them to the person, power, and grace of Christ, to preserve them in grace to glory, to keep them from falling, and present them faultless before the throne of God; the consequence of which is a check to Satan's temptations; an antidote to the doubts and fears he injects; and an abundance of spiritual peace and comfort; as well as it engages to fear the Lord and his goodness. <p>(l)        "etenim veniet (sub.

The verse gives no hint that the judgement itself will be universal; the nations are affected by it only in so far as it reveals the character and deity of the God of Israel. Comp. ch. <a href="/isaiah/18-3.htm" title="All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see you, when he lifts up an ensign on the mountains; and when he blows a trumpet, hear you.">Isaiah 18:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fear the name of the Lord</span>] Cf. <a href="/psalms/102-15.htm" title="So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.">Psalm 102:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">When the enemy shall come in, &c.</span>] R.V. reads: <span class="bld">for he shall come as a rushing stream</span> (marg. <span class="bld">a stream pent in), which the breath of the lord driveth</span>. The rendering of A.V. is based on the Targ., Pesh., and Jewish commentators, and is followed by a few in recent times; that of R.V. has the authority of the LXX. (in part) and Vulg., and is adopted by nearly all the best modern authorities. The chief points of difference are (1) the construction of the word which A.V. translates by <span class="ital">enemy</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">c̨âr</span>). According to the Massoretic pointing and accentuation it is the subject of the sentence, and may be rendered indifferently “adversary” or “adversity.” On the other view it is an adjective qualifying “stream,” and may mean either as an act. part, “rushing,” or (less probably) “straitened,” “pent up.” (2) The verb for <span class="ital">lift up a standard</span> (R.V. “driveth,” Heb. <span class="ital">nôṣçṣ</span>). The A.V. understands it as a denominative from the common word for “standard” (see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm" title="And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.">Isaiah 10:18</a>), while the R.V. derives it from the verb for “flee” (Pil‘el = “drive forward”). The other differences need no elucidation. The second interpretation is alone suitable to the connexion, which “requires a continuous description of the theophany” (Cheyne). For the image in the last clause cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm" title="And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.">Isaiah 30:28</a> (“His breath is as an overflowing stream”).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/59.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall they fear</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and they shall fear.</span> The result of the triumphant exhibition of God's might will be a conversion of the Gentiles, who will flock in both from the west - the quarter of "the islands" - <span class="cmt_word">and from the east, to do reverence to the name and to the glory of the Lord.

The metaphor of "lifting a standard" for making an armed resistance is common in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people have already indicated by &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="/isaiah/59-9.htm">Isaiah 59:9</a> that this benighted, hopeless state is the consequence of their prevailing sins; they now come back to this, and strike the note of penitence (viddui), which is easily recognised by the recurring rhymes a&#772;nu and e&#770;nu. The prophet makes the confession (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19-20</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/3-21.htm">Isaiah 3:21</a>.), standing at the head of the people as the leader of their prayer (ba&#8219;al tephilla&#770;h): "For our transgressions are many before Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are known to us, and our evil deeds well known: apostasy and denial of Jehovah, and turning back from following our God, oppressive and false speaking, receiving and giving out from the heart words of falsehood." The people acknowledge the multitude and magnitude of their apostate deeds, which are the object of the omniscience of God, and their sins which bear witness against them (&#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; the predicate of a neuter plural; Ges. 146, 3). The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; resumes the first: "our apostate deeds are with us (&#1488;&#1514; as in <a href="/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>; cf., &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9</a>), i.e., we are conscious of them; and our misdeeds, we know them" (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; for &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-21.htm">Genesis 41:21</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>, and with &#1506;, as is always the case with verbs &#1500; &#1506; before &#1504;, and with a suffix; Ewald, 60). The sins are now enumerated in <a href="/isaiah/59-13.htm">Isaiah 59:13</a> in abstract infinitive forms. At the head stands apostasy in thought and deed, which is expressed as a threefold sin. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (of Jehovah) belongs to both the "apostasy" (treachery; e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>) and the "denial" (<a href="/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>). &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; is an inf. abs. (different from <a href="/psalms/80-19.htm">Psalm 80:19</a>). Then follow sins against the neighbour: viz., such speaking as leads to oppression, and consists of sa&#770;ra&#770;h, that which deviates from or is opposed to the law and truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>); also the conception (concipere) of lying words, and the utterance of them from the heart in which they are conceived (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1493; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1493; are the only poel infinitives which occur in the Old Testament, just as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13</a>) is the only example of a poel perfect of a verb &#1500; &#1492;. The pol is suitable throughout this passage, because the action expressed affects others, and is intended to do them harm. According to Ewald, the poel indicates the object or tendency: it is the conjugation employed to denote seeking, attacking, or laying hold of; e.g., &#1500;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, lingua petere, i.e., to calumniate; &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1503;, oculo petere, i.e., to envy. </body></html>
