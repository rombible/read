The verse contains a further confession of the evil of their course of life; and, among other things, they acknowledged that they had been unjust in their legal decisions. They had been influenced by partiality and by bribes; they had condemned the innocent, they had acquitted the guilty. Judgment had thus been lumped back by their sins when it seemed to be approaching and entering the city.<p>And justice standeth afar off - This is a beautiful figure. justice is represented as standing at a distance from the city. Deterred by their sins, it would not enter. They prevented its approach, and it was unknown among them.<p>For truth is fallen in the street - Or rather, perhaps, in the gate - the place where justice was administered. The language here is all taken from courts of justice, and the idea is, that there was no justice in their decisions, but that their courts were unprincipled and corrupt.<p>And equity cannot enter - It stood at a distance, and the impenetrable mass of guilt effectually prevented its approach to the capital. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Jarchi interprets this of the vengeance of God, and his righteousness in his judgments, not immediately executed; but it is to be understood of the want of judgment and justice being done among men; and therefore are represented as persons turned back, and standing afar off, rejected, neglected, and discouraged. The Targum renders it, <p>"they that do judgment are turned back, and they that do justice stand afar off;'' <p>having none to take their parts, but everyone opposing them: this may respect both the want of judgment and justice in courts of judicature; no regard being had to right and wrong; no true judgment being given, or justice done, in any cause; but both banished from the bench: and also in the churches of Christ, or, however, under a profession of his name, where there is no judgment in doctrines, or discerning between truth and error; and no justice inflicted on delinquents according to the rules of Christ; no order nor discipline observed in his house; these are dismissed and discarded: <p>for truth is fallen in the street; where it used to be preached, exalted, established, and confirmed; but now thrown down and trampled upon, and few or none to help it up, and stand by it; and though it may have some secret well wishers, yet very few, if any, public advocates for it: <p>and equity cannot enter; either into civil courts, or Christian congregations; the doing of that which is just and right between man and man in things civil; and between Christian and Christian in things religious; or that which is right according to the word of God; can find no place, or cannot be admitted into assemblies that are called by his name. The Targum is, <p>"they that do truth stumble in the street; and they that exercise faith cannot be made manifest;'' <p>such as are on the side of truth, in the service of it, cannot stand their ground through the violence of their opposers; and those that are faithful, and abide by the doctrine of faith, are forced to hide themselves, and cannot appear in the vindication of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/59.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</span><p>(m) There is neither justice nor uprightness among men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/59.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

"The way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their roads: they make their paths crooked: every one who treads upon them knows no peace." With &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, the way upon which a man goes, the prophet uses interchangeably (here and in <a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>) &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, a high-road thrown up with an embankment; &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (with the plural in &#305;&#770;m and o&#770;th), a carriage-road; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, a footpath formed by the constant passing to and fro of travellers. Peaceable conduct, springing form a love of peace, and aiming at producing peace, is altogether strange to them; no such thing is to be met with in their path as the recognition of practice of right: they make their paths for themselves (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, dat. ethicus), i.e., most diligently, twisting about; and whoever treads upon them (ba&#770;h, neuter, as in <a href="/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>), forfeits all enjoyment of either inward or outward peace. Sha&#770;lo&#772;m is repeated significantly, in Isaiah's peculiar style, at the end of the verse. The first strophe of the prophecy closes here: it was from no want of power or willingness on the part of God, that He had not come to the help of His people; the fault lay in their own sins. </body></html>
