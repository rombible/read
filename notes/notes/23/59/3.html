See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For your hands are defiled with blood - The prophet proceeds here more particularly to specify the sins of which they were guilty; and in order to show the extent and depth of their depravity, he specifies the various members of the body - the hands, the fingers, the lips, the tongue, the feet as the agents by which people commit iniquity. See a similar argument on the subject of depravity in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13-15</a>, where a part of the description which the prophet here gives is quoted by Paul, and applied to the Jews in his own time. The phrase 'your hands are defiled with blood,' means with the blood of the innocent; that is, they were guilty of murder, oppression, and cruelty. See a similar statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>, where the phrase 'your hands are full of blood' occurs. The word rendered here 'defiled' (&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  ga&#772;'al) means commonly to redeem, to ransom; then to avenge, or to demand and inflict punishment for bloodshed. In the sense of defiling it occurs only in the later Hebrew writers - perhaps used in this sense because those who were avengers became covered, that is, defiled with blood.<p>And your fingers with iniquity - The fingers in the Scriptures are represented as the agents by which any purpose is executed <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>, 'Which their own fingers have made' (compare <a href="/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>). Some have supposed that the phrase used here means the same as the preceding, that they were guilty of murder and cruelty. But it seems more probable that the idea suggested by Grotius is the true sense, that it means that they were guilty of rapine and theft. The fingers are the instruments by which theft - especially the lighter and more delicate kinds of theft - is executed. Thus we use the word 'light-fingered' to denote anyone who is dexterous in taking and conveying away anything, or anyone who is addicted to petty thefts.<p>Your lips have spoken lies - The nation is false, and no confidence can be reposed in the declarations which are made.<p>Your tongue hath muttered - On the word rendered 'muttered' (&#1492;&#1490;&#1492;  ha&#770;ga&#770;h), see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>. Probably there is included in the word here, the idea that they not only spoke evil, but that they did it with a complaining, discontented, or malicious spirit. It may also mean that they calumniated the government of God, and complained of his laws; or it may mean, as Grotius supposes, that they calumniated others - that is, that slander abounded among them.<p>Perverseness - Hebrew, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;avla&#770;h - 'Evil ' - the word from which our word evil is derived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

From a general charge, the prophet proceeds to a particular enumeration of sins they were guilty of; and idolatry not being mentioned, as Jerom observes, shows that the prophecy belongs to other times than Isaiah's, when that sin greatly prevailed. He begins the account with the sin of shedding blood; the blood of innocents, as the Targum; designing either the sin of murder, now frequently committed in Christian nations; or wars between Christian princes, by means of which much blood is shed; or persecutions of Christian brethren, by casting them into prisons, which have issued in their death; and at least want of brotherly love, or, the hatred of brethren, which is called murder, <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a> a prevailing sin in the present Sardian state; and which will not be removed till the spiritual reign or Philadelphian state takes place: and this sin is of a defiling nature; it "defiles" the "hands" or actions; and without love all works signify nothing, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, yea, even their "fingers" are said to be defiled "with iniquity"; meaning either their lesser actions; or rather those more curiously and nicely performed, and seemingly more agreeable to the divine will; and yet defiled with some sin or other, as hypocrisy, vain glory, or the like: or it may be this may design the same as putting forth the fingers, and smiting with the fist, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and so may have respect to some sort of persecution of their brethren for conscience sake, as there. <p>Your lips have spoken lies: or "falsehood" (q); that is, false doctrines, so called because contrary to the word of truth, and which deceive men: <p>your tongue hath muttered perverseness: that which is a perversion of the Gospel of Christ, and of the souls of men; what is contrary to the sacred Scriptures, the standard of faith and practice, and that premeditated, as the word (r) signifies; done with design, and on purpose: the abounding of errors and heresies in the present day, openly taught and divulged, to the ruin of souls, seems here to be pointed at. In the Talmud (s) these are explained of the several sorts of men in a court of judicature; the "hands" of the judges; the "fingers" of, the Scribes; the "lips" of advocates and solicitors; and the "tongue" of adversaries, or the contending parties. <p>(q) "falsitatem", Montanus, Cocceius; "falsum", Junius &amp; Tremeliius, Piscator.

This divides the promises into two. The middle promise is linked on to the first; the morning dawn giving promise of the "perfect day" (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). The first series of promises we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>. "Then will thy light break forth as the morning dawn, and thy healing will sprout up speedily, and thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will follow thee. Then wilt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou wilt beseech, and He will say, Here am I!" The love of God is called "light" in contrast with His wrath; and a quiet cheerful life in God's love is so called, in contrast with a wild troubled life spent in God's wrath. This life in God's love has its dawn and its noon-day. When it is night both within and around a man, and he suffers himself to be awakened by the love of God to a reciprocity of love; then does the love of God, like the rising sun, open for itself a way through the man's dark night and overcome the darkness of wrath, but so gradually that the sky within is at first only streaked as it were with the red of the morning dawn, the herald of the sun. A second figure of a promising character follows. The man is sick unto death; but when the love of God stimulates him to reciprocal love, he is filled with new vigour, and his recovery springs up suddenly; he feels within him a new life working through with energetic force like a miraculous springing up of verdure from the earth, or of growing and flowering plants. The only other passages in which &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; occurs are in the books of Jeremiah, Chronicles, and Nehemiah. It signifies recovery (lxx here, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, an old mistake for &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, vestimenta), and hence general prosperity (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>). It always occurs with the predicate &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; (causative &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, cf., Targ. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488; &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, another reading &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;), oritur (for which we have here poetically germinat) alicui sanitas; hence Gesenius and others have inferred, that the word originally meant the binding up of a wound, bandage (impontiru alicui fascia). But the primary word is &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;  equals  &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, to set to rights, to restore or put into the right condition (e.g., b. Sabbath 33b, "he cured his wounded flesh"), connected with &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, Arab. a&#770;rak, accommodatus; so that &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, after the form &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, Arab. (though rarely) arika, signifies properly, setting to rights, i.e., restoration. <p>The third promise is: "thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will gather thee, or keep thee together," i.e., be thy rear-guard (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, enclose thee with its protection; &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; as in &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507;, <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>). The figure is a significant one: the first of the mercies of God is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, and the last &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. When Israel is diligent in the performance of works of compassionate love, it is like an army on the march or a travelling caravan, for which righteousness clear and shows the way as being the most appropriate gift of God, and whose rear is closed by the glory of God, which so conducts it to its goal that not one is left behind. The fourth promise assures them of the immediate hearing of prayer, of every appeal to God, every cry for help.<p>But before the prophet brings his promises up to their culminating point, he once more lays down the condition upon which they rest. "If thou put away from the midst of thee the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and speaking of evil, and offerest up thy gluttony to the hungry, and satisfiest the soul that is bowed down: thy light will stream out in the darkness, and thy darkness become like the brightness of noon-day. And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in droughts, and refresh thy bones; and thou wilt become like a well-watered garden, and like a fountain, whose waters never deceive. And thy people will build ruins of the olden time, foundations of earlier generations wilt thou erect; and men will call thee repairers of breaches, restorers of habitable streets." &#1502;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;, a yoke, is here equivalent to yoking or oppression, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where it stands by the side of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; (only met with here, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, Ges. 65, 1, a), the stretching out of the finger, signifies a scornful pointing with the fingers (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) at humbler men, and especially at such as are godly (<a href="/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, the utterance of things which are wicked in themselves and injurious to one's neighbour, hence sinful conversation in general. The early commentators looked for more under &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, than is really meant (and so does even Stier: "they soul, thy heart, all thy sympathetic feelings," etc.). The name of the soul, which is regarded here as greedily longing (<a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>), is used in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a> for that which nourishes it, and here for that which it longs for; the longing itself (appetitus) for the object of the longing (Psychol. p. 204). We may see this very clearly from the choice of the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511; (a voluntative in a conditional clause, Ges. 128, 2), which, starting from the primary meaning educere (related to &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Arabic anfaqa, to give out, distribute, nafaqa, distribution, especially of alms), signifies both to work out, acquire, carry off (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>, etc.), and also to take out, deliver, offer, expromere (as in this instance and <a href="/psalms/140-9.htm">Psalm 140:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-13.htm">Psalm 144:13</a>). The soul "bowed down" is bowed down in this instance through abstinence. The apodoses commence with the perf. cons. &#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;. &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; is the darkness caused by the utter absence of light (Arab. afalat esh-shemsu, "the sun has become invisible"); see at <a href="/job/10-22.htm">Job 10:22</a>. This, as the substantive clause affirms, is like the noon-day, which is called &#1510;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, because at that point the daylight of both the forenoon and afternoon, the rising and setting light, is divided as it were into two by the climax which it has attained. A new promise points to the fat, that such a man may enjoy without intermission the mild and safe guidance of divine grace, for which &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, syn. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;) is the word commonly employed; and another to the communication of the most copious supply of strength. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1; &#1489;&#1510;&#1495;&#1510;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; does not state with what God will satisfy the soul, as Hahn supposes (after Jerome, "splendoribus"), but according to &#1510;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>) and such promises as <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>, the kind of satisfaction and the circumstances under which it occurs, viz., in extreme droughts (Targ. "years of drought"). In the place of the perf. cons. we have then the future, which facilitates the elevation of the object: "and thy bones will He make strong," &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;, for which Hupfeld would read &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, "will He rejuvenate." &#1495;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; is a denom. of &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, expeditus; it may, however, be directly derived from a verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1509;, presupposed by &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, not, however, in the meaning "to be fat" (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and so also Kimchi), but "to be strong," lit., to be loose or ready for action; and b. Jebamoth 102b has the very suitable gloss &#1490;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; (making the bones strong). This idea of invigorating is then unfolded in two different figures, of which that of a well-watered garden sets forth the abundance received, that of a spring the abundance possessed. Natural objects are promised, but as a gift of grace; for this is the difference between the two testaments, that in the Old Testament the natural is ever striving to reach the spiritual, whereas in the New Testament the spiritual lifts up the natural to its own level. The Old Testament is ever striving to give inwardness to what was outward; in the New Testament this object is attained, and the further object now is to make the outward conformed to the inward, the natural life to the spiritual. <p>The last promise (whether the seventh or eighth, depends upon whether we include the growing of the morning light into the light of noon, or not) takes its form from the pining of the exiles for their home: "and thy people (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;) build" (Ewald, 295, c); and Bttcher would read &#1502;&#1502;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;; but &#1502;&#1503; with a passive, although more admissible in Hebrew than in Arabic, is very rarely met with, and then more frequently in the sense of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; than in that of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; followed by a plural of the thing would be more exact than customary. Moreover, there is no force in the objection that &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; with the active can only signify "some of thee," since it is equivalent to &#1502;&#1502;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, those who sprang from thee and belong to thee by kindred descent. The members born to the congregation in exile will begin, as soon as they return to their home, to build up again the ruins of olden time, the foundations of earlier generations, i.e., houses and cities of which only the foundations are left (<a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>); therefore Israel restored to its fatherland receives the honourable title of "builder of breaches," "restorer of streets (i.e., of places much frequented once) &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;" (for inhabiting), i.e., so that, although so desolate now (<a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>), they become habitable and populous once more. </body></html>
