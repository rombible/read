See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The way of peace they know not - The phrase 'way of peace' may denote either peace of conscience, peace with God, peace among themselves, or peace with their fellow-men. Possibly it may refer to all these; and the sense will be, that in their whole lives they were strangers to true contentment and happiness. From no quarter had they peace, but whether in relation to God, to their own consciences, to each other, or to their fellow-men, they were involved in continual strife and agitation (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>).<p>And there is no judgment in their goings - Margin, 'Right.' The sense is, that there was no justice in their dealings. there was no disposition to do right. They were full of selfishness, falsehood, oppression, and cruelty.<p>They have made them crooked paths - A crooked path is an emblem of dishonesty, fraud, deceit. A straight path is an emblem of sincerity, truth, honesty, and uprightness (see <a href="/psalms/125-5.htm">Psalm 125:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>; and the notes at <a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>). The idea is, that their counsels and plans were perverse and evil.

In the previous prophecy we found the virtues which are well-pleasing to God, and to which He promises redemption as a reward of grace, set in contrast with those false means, upon which the people rested their claim to redemption. In the prophecy before us the sins which retard redemption are still more directly exposed. "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not too short to help, nor His ear too heavy to hear; but your iniquities have become a party-wall between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear." The reason why redemption is delayed, is not that the power of Jehovah has not been sufficient for it (cf., <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>), or that He has not been aware of their desire for it, but that their iniquities (&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; with the second syllable defective) have become dividers (&#1502;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, defective), have grown into a party-wall between them and their God, and their sins (cf., <a href="/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25</a>) have hidden pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m from them. As the "hand" (ya&#770;d) in <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> is the absolute hand; so here the "face" pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m) is that face which sees everything, which is everywhere present, whether uncovered or concealed; which diffuses light when it unveils itself, and leaves darkness when it is veiled; the sight of which is blessedness, and not to see which is damnation. This absolute countenance is never to be seen in this life without a veil; but the rejection and abuse of grace make this veil a perfectly impenetrable covering. And Israel had forfeited in this way the light and sight of this countenance of God, and had raised a party-wall between itself and Him, and that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;, so that He did not hear, i.e., so that their prayer did not reach Him (<a href="/lamentations/3-44.htm">Lamentations 3:44</a>) or bring down an answer from Him. </body></html>
