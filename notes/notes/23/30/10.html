They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which say to the seers - The prophets (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>).<p>See not - They desire not that they should communicate to them the will of Yahweh.<p>Prophesy not unto us right things - It is not probable that they "openly" demanded of the prophets that they should declare falsehood and deceit, but their conduct was as if they had required that. The sense is, they bore with impatience the theatenings and commands of the true prophets; they were offended at their plainness and their reproofs of their vices; and they preferred the false prophets, who fell in with their prejudices, and who did not denounce the judgment of God for their crimes.<p>Speak unto us smooth things - That is, those things which are in accordance with our feelings, prejudices, and desires; which assure us of prosperity and success, and which will not disturb us with the apprehension of punishment. This was spoken particularly of their desire to make a league with Egypt, an enterprise for which the true prophets threatened them with the divine displeasure, but which probably the false prophets encouraged.<p>Prophesy deceits - Not that they would openly and avowedly demand to be deceived, but they demanded that which the prophet says would be deceits. No man "professedly" desires to be deceived; but many a man is willing to put himself under that kind of teaching which is deceit, and which he might know to be falsehood if he would examine it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The negotiations by means of ambassadors have already been commenced; but the prophet condemns what he can no longer prevent. "Woe to the stubborn children, saith Jehovah, to drive plans, and not by my impulse, and to plait alliance, and not according to my Spirit, to heap sin upon sin: that go away to travel down to Egypt, without having asked my mouth, to fly to Pharaoh's shelter, and to conceal themselves under the shadow of Egypt. And Pharaoh's shelter becomes a shame to them, and the concealment under the shadow of Egypt a disgrace. For Judah's princes have appeared in Zoan, and his ambassadors arrive in Hanes. They will all have to be ashamed of a people useless to them, that brings no help and no use, but shame, and also reproach." So&#772;rer&#305;&#772;m is followed by infinitives with Lamed (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>): who are bent upon it in their obstinacy. Masse&#772;kha&#770;h designates the alliance as a plait (masse&#772;kheth). According to Cappellus and others, it designates it as formed with a libation (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;, from &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;); but the former is certainly the more correct view, inasmuch as masse&#772;kha&#770;h (from na&#770;sakh, fundere) signifies a cast, and hence it is more natural here to take na&#770;sakh as equivalent to sa&#770;khakh, plectere (Jerome: ordiremini telam). The context leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the adverbial expressions &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, viz., without its having proceeded from me, and without my Spirit being there. "Sin upon sin:" inasmuch as they carry out further and further to perfect realization the thought which was already a sinful one in itself. The prophet now follows for himself the ambassadors, who are already on the road to the country of the Nile valley. He sees them arrive in Zoan, and watches them as they proceed thence into Hanes. He foresees and foretells what a disgraceful opening of their eyes will attend the reward of this untheocratical beginning. On la&#770;&#8219;o&#772;z b', see at <a href="/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a> : &#8219;o&#772;z is the infinitive constr. of &#8219;u&#772;z; ma&#770;&#8219;o&#772;z, on the contrary, is a derivative of &#8219;a&#770;zaz, to be strong. The suffixes of &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (his princes) and &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; (his ambassadors) are supposed by Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel, who take a different view of what is said, to refer to the princes and ambassadors of Pharaoh. But this is by no means warranted on the ground that the prophet cannot so immediately transfer to Zoan and Hanes the ambassadors of Judah, who were still on their journey according to <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>. The prophet's vision overleaps the existing stage of the desire for this alliance; he sees the great men of his nation already suing for the favour of Egypt, first of all in Zoan, and then still further in Hanes, and at once foretells the shameful termination of this self-desecration of the people of Jehovah.
