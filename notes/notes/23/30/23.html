Vitringa, with some other commentators, thinks it appears plainly, from the next two verses, that the prophet is to be understood in this passage as speaking, not so much literally as figuratively, and that the words contain a splendid promise of pure and abundant spiritual provision, made by the Lord for his people, in the ministry of the word, the spiritual sowing; the effusions of his Spirit, <span class="ital">the rain of the seed; </span>and in the due administration of his various ordinances, <span class="ital">the large pastures </span>in which his flock feeds.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:19-26 God's people will soon arrive at the Zion above, and then they will weep no more for ever. Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase.

"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, Through turning and rest ye would be helped; your strength would show itself in quietness and confidence; but ye would not. And ye said, No, but we will fly upon horses; therefore ye shall flee: and, We will ride upon racehorses; therefore your pursuers will race. A thousand, ye will flee from the threatening of one, from the threatening of five, until ye are reduced to a remnant, like a pine upon the top of the mountain, and like a banner upon the hill." The conditions upon which their salvation depended, and by complying with which they would attain to it, were shu&#772;bha&#770;h, turning from their self-chosen way, and nachath, rest from self-confident work of their own (from nu&#772;a&#774;ch, like rachath, ventilabrum, from ru&#772;a&#774;ch, and shachath, fovea, from shu&#772;a&#774;ch). Their strength (i.e., what they would be able to do in opposition to the imperial power) would show itself (ha&#770;ya&#770;h, arise, come to the light, as in <a href="/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>), in hashqe&#772;t, laying aside their busy care and stormy eagerness, and bitcha&#770;h, trust, which cleaves to Jehovah and, renouncing all self-help, leaves Him to act alone. This was the leading and fundamental principle of the prophet's politics even in the time of Ahaz (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). But from the very first they would not act upon it; nor would they now that the alliance with Egypt had become an irreversible fact. To fly upon horses, and ride away upon racehorses (kal, like &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, celer)<p>(Note: We regard the Sanscrit kal, to drive or hunt, the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;(&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;)&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and the Semitic qal, as all having the same root: cf., Vurtius, Grundzge der griech. Etymol. i.116.))<p>had been and still was their proud and carnal ambition, which Jehovah would answer by fulfilling upon them the curses of the thorah (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).  One, or at the most five, of the enemy would be able with their snorting to put to flight a whole thousand of the men of Judah. The verb nu&#772;s (<a href="/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16</a>), which rhymes with su&#772;s, is used first of all in its primary sense of "flying" (related to nu&#772;ts, cf., <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>), and then in its more usual sense of "fleeing." (Luzzatto, after Abulwald: vogliamo far sui cavalli gloriosa comparsa, from nu&#772;s, or rather na&#770;sas, hence na&#770;no&#772;s, from which comes ne&#772;s, excellere.) &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, the fut. niphal, signifies to be light, i.e., swift; whereas &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;, the fut. kal, had become a common expression for light in the sense of despised or lightly esteemed. The horses and chariots are Judah's own (<a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>; <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), though possibly with the additional allusion to the Egyptian cavalry, of world-wide renown, which they had called to their help. In <a href="/isaiah/30-17.htm">Isaiah 30:17</a> the subject of the first clause is also that of the second, and consequently we have not &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (compare the asyndeta in <a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>). The insertion of rebha&#770;bha&#770;h (ten thousand) after cha&#774;missha&#770;h (five), which Lowth, Gesenius, and others propose, is quite unnecessary. The play upon the words symbolizes the divine law of retribution (talio), which would be carried out with regard to them. The nation, which had hitherto resembled a thick forest, would become like a lofty pine (to&#772;rne, according to the talmudic tu&#772;rn&#305;&#772;tha&#770;, Pinus pinea), standing solitary upon the top of a mountain, and like a flagstaff planted upon a hill - a miserable remnant in the broad land so fearfully devastated by war. For &#1488;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; followed by a preterite (equivalent to the fut. exactum), compare <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a> and <a href="/genesis/24-19.htm">Genesis 24:19</a>. </body></html>
