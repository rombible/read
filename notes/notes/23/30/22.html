Probably it was fulfilled still more upon the deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib’s army, which, doubtless, would convince thousands of individuals of the almighty power of Jehovah, of the impotence of idols, and the sin and folly of worshipping them. But it was verified in the whole body of the Jewish nation, at their return from their captivity in Babylon, for they abhorred idols ever after. Add to this, it is accomplished daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of divine grace, from spiritual idolatry, to the fear and love of God. This deliverance from the love and practice of idolatry is the third blessing here represented as being conferred on the people, after the forementioned judgments.

Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God.

This is language which is often used respecting their treatment of the images and altars of idolatry when they became objects of abomination, and when they were induced to abandon them (see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>). It is not improbable that before destroying them they would express their abhorrence of them by some act of polluting or defiling them, as significant of their contempt for the objects of degraded idolatry (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). The sense of the whole passage is, that the effect of the judgments which God was about to bring upon the nation would be, to turn them from idolatry, to which as a nation they had been signally prone.<p>The covering - The images of idols were usually made of wood or clay, and overlaid with gold. That gold and silver were used "to plate" them is apparent from <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>; and the whole process of making them from wood, and then of overlaying them with plates of gold and silver is described with graphic power and severity of irony in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-6.htm">Isaiah 41:6-7</a>.<p>Thy graven images of silver - Margin, 'The graven images of thy silver.'

"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, Through turning and rest ye would be helped; your strength would show itself in quietness and confidence; but ye would not. And ye said, No, but we will fly upon horses; therefore ye shall flee: and, We will ride upon racehorses; therefore your pursuers will race. A thousand, ye will flee from the threatening of one, from the threatening of five, until ye are reduced to a remnant, like a pine upon the top of the mountain, and like a banner upon the hill." The conditions upon which their salvation depended, and by complying with which they would attain to it, were shu&#772;bha&#770;h, turning from their self-chosen way, and nachath, rest from self-confident work of their own (from nu&#772;a&#774;ch, like rachath, ventilabrum, from ru&#772;a&#774;ch, and shachath, fovea, from shu&#772;a&#774;ch). Their strength (i.e., what they would be able to do in opposition to the imperial power) would show itself (ha&#770;ya&#770;h, arise, come to the light, as in <a href="/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>), in hashqe&#772;t, laying aside their busy care and stormy eagerness, and bitcha&#770;h, trust, which cleaves to Jehovah and, renouncing all self-help, leaves Him to act alone. This was the leading and fundamental principle of the prophet's politics even in the time of Ahaz (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). But from the very first they would not act upon it; nor would they now that the alliance with Egypt had become an irreversible fact. To fly upon horses, and ride away upon racehorses (kal, like &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, celer)<p>(Note: We regard the Sanscrit kal, to drive or hunt, the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;(&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;)&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and the Semitic qal, as all having the same root: cf., Vurtius, Grundzge der griech. Etymol. i.116.))<p>had been and still was their proud and carnal ambition, which Jehovah would answer by fulfilling upon them the curses of the thorah (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).  One, or at the most five, of the enemy would be able with their snorting to put to flight a whole thousand of the men of Judah. The verb nu&#772;s (<a href="/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16</a>), which rhymes with su&#772;s, is used first of all in its primary sense of "flying" (related to nu&#772;ts, cf., <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>), and then in its more usual sense of "fleeing." (Luzzatto, after Abulwald: vogliamo far sui cavalli gloriosa comparsa, from nu&#772;s, or rather na&#770;sas, hence na&#770;no&#772;s, from which comes ne&#772;s, excellere.) &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, the fut. niphal, signifies to be light, i.e., swift; whereas &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;, the fut. kal, had become a common expression for light in the sense of despised or lightly esteemed. The horses and chariots are Judah's own (<a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>; <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), though possibly with the additional allusion to the Egyptian cavalry, of world-wide renown, which they had called to their help.

The insertion of rebha&#770;bha&#770;h (ten thousand) after cha&#774;missha&#770;h (five), which Lowth, Gesenius, and others propose, is quite unnecessary. The play upon the words symbolizes the divine law of retribution (talio), which would be carried out with regard to them. The nation, which had hitherto resembled a thick forest, would become like a lofty pine (to&#772;rne, according to the talmudic tu&#772;rn&#305;&#772;tha&#770;, Pinus pinea), standing solitary upon the top of a mountain, and like a flagstaff planted upon a hill - a miserable remnant in the broad land so fearfully devastated by war.
