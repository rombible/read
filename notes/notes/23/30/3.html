Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>).<p>Your confusion - Hebrew, 'For reproach.'

"Is it not yet a very little, and Lebanon is turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field esteemed as a forest? And in that day the deaf hear scripture words, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. And the joy of the humble increases in Jehovah, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. For tyrants are gone, and it is over with scoffers; and all who think evil are rooted out, who condemn a man for a word, and lay snares for him that is free-spoken in the gate, and overthrow the righteous through shameful lies." The circumstances themselves, as well as the sentence passed, will experience a change, in complete contrast with the present state of things. This is what is affirmed in <a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>; probably a proverb transposed into a more literary style. What is now forest becomes ennobled into garden ground; and what is garden ground becomes in general estimation a forest (&#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, although we should rather expect &#1500;, just as in <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>). These emblems are explained in <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. The people that are now blind and deaf, so far as the word of Jehovah is concerned, are changed into a people with open ears and seeing eyes. Scripture words, like those which the prophet now holds before the people so unsuccessfully, are heard by those who have been deaf. The unfettered sight of those who have been blind pierces through the hitherto surrounding darkness. The heirs of the new future thus transformed are the ana&#770;v&#305;&#772;m ("meek") and the 'ebhyo&#772;n&#305;&#772;m ("poor"). &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (the antithesis of &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, e.g., <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>) heightens the representation of lowliness; the combination is a superlative one, as in &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20</a>, and &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497; in <a href="/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a> (cf., &#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; in <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm">Isaiah 35:9</a>): needy men who present a glaring contrast to, and stand out from, the general body of men. Such men will obtain ever increasing joy in Jehovah (ya&#770;saph as in <a href="/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a>). Such a people of God would take the place of the oppressors (cf., <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a>) and scoffers (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>), and those who thought evil (sha&#770;qad, invigilare, sedulo agere), i.e., the wretched planners, who made a &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; of every one who did not enter into their plans (i.e., who called him a cho&#772;te&#772;'; cf., <a href="/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>), and went to law with the man who openly opposed them in the gate (<a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>; yeqo&#772;shu&#772;n, possibly the perf. kal, cf., <a href="/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a>; according to the syntax, however, it is the fut. kal of qu&#772;sh  equals  ya&#770;qo&#772;sh: see at <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; Ges. 44, Anm. 4), and thrust away the righteous, i.e., forced him away from his just rights (<a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>), by to&#772;hu&#772;, i.e., accusations and pretences of the utmost worthlessness; for these would all have been swept away. This is the true explanation of the last clause, as given in the Targum, and not "into the desert and desolation," as Knobel and Luzzatto suppose; for with Isaiah to&#772;hu&#772; is the synonym for all such words as signify nothingness, groundlessness, and fraud. The prophet no doubt had in his mind, at the time that he uttered these words, the conduct of the people towards himself and his fellow-prophets, and such as were like-minded with them. The charge brought against him of being a conspirator, or a traitor to his country, was a to&#772;hu&#772; of this kind. All these conspirators and persecutors Jehovah would clear entirely away. </body></html>
