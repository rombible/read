Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wo, - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>).<p>To the rebellious children - To those whom he had nourished as children, and who had rebelled against him (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>).<p>That take counsel, but not of me - They look to Egypt, and depend on a human arm.<p>And that cover with a covering - The idea here, according to our translation, is, that they seek protection or a covering from the impending calamity. Lowth renders this, 'Who ratify covenants;' supposing that the reference is to the fact that in ancient times compacts were formed by offering sacrifices, and by pouring out libations. The Hebrew, according to Lowth, means, 'who pour out a libation.' So the Septuagint renders it, &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  sunthe&#772;kas - 'And thou hast made covenants.' The Syriac renders it, 'Who pour out libations.' The Hebrew word &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;  na&#770;sak properly conveys the idea of pouring out, and is applied:<p>(1) to the act of pouring out wine as a drink offering, or as a libation to God <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-18.htm">1 Chronicles 11:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a>;<p>(2) to the act of pouring out oil, that is, to anointing kings and rulers <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a>;<p>(3) to the act of pouring out melted metals, that is, to cast them <a href="/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-10.htm">Isaiah 44:10</a>.<p>The word also may have a meaning kindred to &#1505;&#1499;&#1498;  sa&#770;kak and denote "to cover," as in <a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>.

The idea, however, which best suits the connection here is probably that suggested by Lowth, in accordance with the Septuagint, and the Syriac, and adopted by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and others, "to make a libation;" that is, to ratify a covenant, or compact.<p>But not of my Spirit - It was not such as was suggested by his Spirit, and not such as he would approve.<p>That they may add sin to sin - They add to the sin of rebellion against God that of forming an alliance.

The Jews, who were, by national adoption, and by outward profession of religion, the "children" of God, but were apostates from him, had turned their backs upon him, deviated from his law, and departed from his worship and ordinances; and therefore a woe is pronounced against them, or they are called upon to consider of their evil ways, and return, that iniquity might not be their ruin: <p>that take counsel, but not of me; they met and consulted together about their safety, when in danger, but did not ask counsel of the Lord; they did not consult his word, nor his prophets, nor by Urim and Thummim, as in case of war they should more especially: <p>and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit; they sought for a cover, a shelter, a protection from the enemy, but not from the Spirit of the Lord, in his word and prophets, who would have directed them to a more suitable and sufficient one. Kimchi understands this of their covert and secret counsels, which they laid deep, as they fancied, and sought to hide. The Targum of the former clause and this is, <p>"that take counsel, but not of my word; that consult a consultation, but do not ask of my prophets:'' <p>that they may add sin to sin; the sins of consulting others, and of putting confidence in a creature, to their other sins of rebellion and apostasy: so wicked men, who are enemies in their minds, by wicked works, to God, and commit acts of hostility against him, and are in danger thereby of eternal ruin, do not consult the word and ministers of the Gospel, but flesh and blood, carnal sense and reason, and seek to cover themselves with the rags of their own righteousness, and not with the robe of Christ's righteousness, and garments of salvation, which the Spirit of God reveals and brings near; and so to their other sins they add that of trusting to their own righteousness, and not submitting to Christ's. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe to the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not from me; and that <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</span><p>(a) Who contrary to their promise take not me for their protector and contrary to my commandment seek help from strangers.<p>(b) They seek shifts to cloak their doings and not godly means.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Woe to the rebellious children</span>] See on <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm" title="Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.">Isaiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm" title="That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:">Isaiah 30:9</a>.

"Is it not yet a very little, and Lebanon is turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field esteemed as a forest? And in that day the deaf hear scripture words, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. And the joy of the humble increases in Jehovah, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. For tyrants are gone, and it is over with scoffers; and all who think evil are rooted out, who condemn a man for a word, and lay snares for him that is free-spoken in the gate, and overthrow the righteous through shameful lies." The circumstances themselves, as well as the sentence passed, will experience a change, in complete contrast with the present state of things. This is what is affirmed in <a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>; probably a proverb transposed into a more literary style. What is now forest becomes ennobled into garden ground; and what is garden ground becomes in general estimation a forest (&#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, although we should rather expect &#1500;, just as in <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>). These emblems are explained in <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. The people that are now blind and deaf, so far as the word of Jehovah is concerned, are changed into a people with open ears and seeing eyes. Scripture words, like those which the prophet now holds before the people so unsuccessfully, are heard by those who have been deaf. The unfettered sight of those who have been blind pierces through the hitherto surrounding darkness. The heirs of the new future thus transformed are the ana&#770;v&#305;&#772;m ("meek") and the 'ebhyo&#772;n&#305;&#772;m ("poor"). &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (the antithesis of &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, e.g., <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>) heightens the representation of lowliness; the combination is a superlative one, as in &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20</a>, and &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497; in <a href="/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a> (cf., &#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; in <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm">Isaiah 35:9</a>): needy men who present a glaring contrast to, and stand out from, the general body of men.

Such a people of God would take the place of the oppressors (cf., <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a>) and scoffers (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>), and those who thought evil (sha&#770;qad, invigilare, sedulo agere), i.e., the wretched planners, who made a &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; of every one who did not enter into their plans (i.e., who called him a cho&#772;te&#772;'; cf., <a href="/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>), and went to law with the man who openly opposed them in the gate (<a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>; yeqo&#772;shu&#772;n, possibly the perf. kal, cf., <a href="/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a>; according to the syntax, however, it is the fut. kal of qu&#772;sh  equals  ya&#770;qo&#772;sh: see at <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; Ges. 44, Anm. 4), and thrust away the righteous, i.e., forced him away from his just rights (<a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>), by to&#772;hu&#772;, i.e., accusations and pretences of the utmost worthlessness; for these would all have been swept away. This is the true explanation of the last clause, as given in the Targum, and not "into the desert and desolation," as Knobel and Luzzatto suppose; for with Isaiah to&#772;hu&#772; is the synonym for all such words as signify nothingness, groundlessness, and fraud. The prophet no doubt had in his mind, at the time that he uttered these words, the conduct of the people towards himself and his fellow-prophets, and such as were like-minded with them. The charge brought against him of being a conspirator, or a traitor to his country, was a to&#772;hu&#772; of this kind. All these conspirators and persecutors Jehovah would clear entirely away. </body></html>
