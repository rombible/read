They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Get ye out of the way - Or, rather, 'Recede from the way;' or 'Turn aside from the way.'

The request here was that the true prophets would recede from the stern and true precepts of religion, and turn to the ways of falsehood and deceit.<p>Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us - The sense of this is, 'Let us hear no more of this name. We are weary of constantly hearing it, as if there was nothing else but the ceaseless repetition of the name "The Holy One of Israel.'" It is to be remembered that the prophets spoke in this name, and often commenced their prophecies with the announcement, 'thus saith the Holy One of Israel.' No one more frequently used this than Isaiah (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-12.htm">Isaiah 30:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14</a>). It is probable that a reference constantly to the fact that he was holy, was that which most troubled them. How descriptive of the feelings of sinners! How striking an illustration of the fact that they do not wish to hear of the name or laws of the Holy Lord God! And what a melancholy proof of depravity is it when people pursue such a course that they do not wish to hear of Him, and desire no more to be troubled with His name and laws! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

These two expressions mean one and the same thing; either that the prophets would go out of their usual way of threatening ruin and destruction; or that they would go out of the way of the people, and not stand in it to hinder them pursuing their own lusts and pleasures; or that they would go out of the right way, as the Targum, which is God's way, and join with them; or, at least, connive at, and indulge them, in their ways: <p>cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us; do not so often make mention of his name, or come to us with a "thus saith the Lord"; let us hear no more of him, or messages from him; and especially under this character of "the Holy One of Israel", who is by nature holy, loves holiness, and requires it, and hates sin.

"The Holy One of Israel" was one of Isaiah's most frequent names for the Almighty. He used it especially when rebuking Israel's unholiness (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, etc.). The irreligious Jews were weary of this constant iteration, and wished to hear no more concerning this "Holy One," whose very holiness was a reproach to them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The plan which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>, was already projected and prepared in the deepest secrecy, is now much further advanced. The negotiations by means of ambassadors have already been commenced; but the prophet condemns what he can no longer prevent. "Woe to the stubborn children, saith Jehovah, to drive plans, and not by my impulse, and to plait alliance, and not according to my Spirit, to heap sin upon sin: that go away to travel down to Egypt, without having asked my mouth, to fly to Pharaoh's shelter, and to conceal themselves under the shadow of Egypt. And Pharaoh's shelter becomes a shame to them, and the concealment under the shadow of Egypt a disgrace. For Judah's princes have appeared in Zoan, and his ambassadors arrive in Hanes. They will all have to be ashamed of a people useless to them, that brings no help and no use, but shame, and also reproach." So&#772;rer&#305;&#772;m is followed by infinitives with Lamed (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>): who are bent upon it in their obstinacy. Masse&#772;kha&#770;h designates the alliance as a plait (masse&#772;kheth). According to Cappellus and others, it designates it as formed with a libation (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;, from &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;); but the former is certainly the more correct view, inasmuch as masse&#772;kha&#770;h (from na&#770;sakh, fundere) signifies a cast, and hence it is more natural here to take na&#770;sakh as equivalent to sa&#770;khakh, plectere (Jerome: ordiremini telam). The context leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the adverbial expressions &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, viz., without its having proceeded from me, and without my Spirit being there. "Sin upon sin:" inasmuch as they carry out further and further to perfect realization the thought which was already a sinful one in itself. The prophet now follows for himself the ambassadors, who are already on the road to the country of the Nile valley. He sees them arrive in Zoan, and watches them as they proceed thence into Hanes. He foresees and foretells what a disgraceful opening of their eyes will attend the reward of this untheocratical beginning. On la&#770;&#8219;o&#772;z b', see at <a href="/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a> : &#8219;o&#772;z is the infinitive constr. of &#8219;u&#772;z; ma&#770;&#8219;o&#772;z, on the contrary, is a derivative of &#8219;a&#770;zaz, to be strong. The suffixes of &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (his princes) and &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; (his ambassadors) are supposed by Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel, who take a different view of what is said, to refer to the princes and ambassadors of Pharaoh. But this is by no means warranted on the ground that the prophet cannot so immediately transfer to Zoan and Hanes the ambassadors of Judah, who were still on their journey according to <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>. The prophet's vision overleaps the existing stage of the desire for this alliance; he sees the great men of his nation already suing for the favour of Egypt, first of all in Zoan, and then still further in Hanes, and at once foretells the shameful termination of this self-desecration of the people of Jehovah.

The latter was the name of a city on an island of the Nile in Central Egypt, the later Heracleopolis (Eg. Hne&#772;s; Ehne&#772;s), the Anysis of Herodotus (ii. 137). On Zoan, see at <a href="/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>. At that time the Tanitic dynasty was reigning, the dynasty preceding the Ethiopian.
