There seems no reason, however, why the prophet should not have prefixed it as with the sarcasm of an indignant irony. “You ask for an oracle,” he seems to say, and you shall have one; but its very heading will imply condemnation and derision; “and then he continues his picture of the journey of the embassy.

In these verses the prophet has before his eyes “the ambassadors of the Jews, or, as some think, also of Hosea, and the Ephraimites, (see <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2 Kings 17:4</a>,) bearing their splendid and sumptuous presents on asses and camels into Egypt; and perceiving that they would reap no advantage from this proud and sumptuous embassy, and that the whole would be fruitless, or rather would raise the indignation of the Assyrians, he cannot refrain, but exhibits, to the life, the whole scheme of this imprudence, folly, and incredulity, as it was immediately presented to his prophetic sight, with its shameful and sorrowful event.” <span class="ital">Into the land of trouble and anguish </span>— Into Egypt and Ethiopia, for both were joined together in this matter, (see chap. 20.,) whose land seems to be called a <span class="ital">land of trouble, </span>&c., prophetically, because they should distress and not help those that applied to and trusted in them, as was said of the Assyrians in the like case, <a href="/2_chronicles/28-20.htm" title="And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>. Bishop Lowth, who supposes that the deserts are here meant, which the Israelites passed through when they came out of Egypt, renders it, <span class="ital">by, </span>or <span class="ital">through a land of distress, </span>&c. But it seems more likely, as it certainly was more important, that the land <span class="ital">to </span>which, than that <span class="ital">through </span>which, they went, should be spoken of. Besides, the direct road from Judea to Egypt was not through such a country as is here described. <span class="ital">From whence come the young and old lion, </span>&c. — This may be understood literally, for “Egypt, at this time, joined to Ethiopia, was, of all countries, most fertile of every fierce and wild creature, which the nature of man abhors, both terrestrial and aquatic.” See <span class="ital">Boch. Hieroz., </span>p. 2:1. 3. c. 13. The words, however, may have a higher and mystical meaning, and by these wild and savage creatures may be designed the craft and cruelty of the Egyptians and Ethiopians, and the danger and injury the Jews, or Israelites, would bring upon themselves by a confederacy with them. <span class="ital">Therefore have I cried concerning this </span>— This counsel, or practice; <span class="ital">their strength is to sit still </span>— It is safer and better for them to stay quietly at home, seeking to God for help, than to go or send to Egypt for it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-7 It was often the fault and folly of the Jews, that when troubled by their neighbours on one side, they sought for succour from others, instead of looking up to God. Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burden of the beasts of the south - The word 'south' here refers doubtless to the country to the south of Judea; and particularly to Egypt. Thus it is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5-6</a>. The phrase 'beasts of the south,' here refers to the animals that were traveling to Egypt. Isaiah, in vision, sees the caravan heavily laden with treasures pursuing a southern direction on its way to Egypt. The word 'burden' is used in two senses, to denote that which is borne, a heavy burden; or an oracle, a solemn prophetic message (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>). Many understand the word here in the latter sense, and regard this as the title of a prophetic message similar to those in <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>. But the word is doubtless used here in its ordinary signification, to denote the load which is borne on animals, and here especially the treasures which were borne down to Egypt, for the purpose of securing their friendly alliance. The prophet sees the caravan, or the beasts of the ambassadors heavily laden with rich treasures, traveling southward toward Egypt, and cries out, 'O the heavy burden, the load of treasures going to the south!'<p>Into the land of trouble and anguish - Egypt; so called either because it was the land where the Hebrews had formerly suffered so severe oppressions; or because it was a land where the subjects were now grievously oppressed, and borne down with cruel laws; or because it was yet to be a land of trouble, from which the Jews could expect no aid. The general idea is, that Egypt was not a land of liberty and happiness, but a country where cruelty, oppression, and woe abounded. One source of trouble, as emblematic of all, the prophet immediately mentions when he designates that it abounded with venomous reptiles.<p>The viper - (&#1488;&#1508;&#1506;&#1492;  'eph&#8219;eh). Septuagint, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  Aspides 'asps' (see <a href="/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>). This is a well-known species of serpent. It is probably the same as the El-Effah of the Arabs which is thus described by Mr. Jackson: 'It is remarkable for its quick and penetrating poison; it is about two feet long and as thick as a man's arm, beautifully spotted with yellow and brown, and sprinkled over with blackish specks, similar to the horn-nosed snake. They have a wide mouth, by which they inhale a great quantity of air, and when inflated therewith they eject it with such force as to be heard at a considerable distance.' It is well known that Egypt produced venomous reptiles in abundance. Cleopatra destroyed herself with the bite of an asp which she had concealed for that purpose.<p>And fiery flying serpent - (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;  s'a&#770;ra&#770;ph  me&#8219;o&#770;pe&#772;p). Septuagint, &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Ekgona aspido&#772;n petomeno&#772;n. This is the flying serpent so often referred to in the Scriptures. See a description of it in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>. It is known to have abounded in the Arabian deserts, and was doubtless found also in Egypt as being in the same latitude, and infested with similar reptiles. Niebuhr thus describes a species of serpent which answers to this account. 'There is at Bakra a sort of serpents which they call Heie Sursurie, or Heie Thiare. They commonly keep upon the date trees; and as it would be laborious for them to come down from a very high tree in order to ascend another, they twist themselves by the tail to a branch of the former, which, making a spring, by the motion they give it, throw themselves to the second. Hence, it is that the modern Arabs call them the flying serpents - Heie Thiare. Lord Anson, as quoted by Niebuhr, also speaks of them as follows: 'The Spaniards informed us that there was often found in the woods a most mischievous serpent, called the flying snake, which, they said, darted itself from the boughs of trees on either man or beast that came within its reach, and whose sting they took to be inevitable death.' There was a species of serpent which the Greeks called &#x391;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  Acontias, and the Roman Jaculus, from their swift darting motion, and perhaps the same species is here referred to which Lucan calls Jaculique volucres. That these venomous reptiles abounded in Egypt is expressly testified by profane writers. Thus Ammianus says (xxii. 15), that 'Egypt nourishes innumerable serpents, basilisks, and twoheaded serpents (amphisbaenas), and the seytalus (a serpent of a glistening color), and the acontias (Latin, Jaculus), and adders, and vipers, and many others.'<p>They will carry their riches - Presents, designed to induce the Egyptians to enter into the alliance. That it was a common custom to make presents when one king sent an embassy to another, whether the design was to show friendship or civility, or to form an alliance, is well known in regard to all the nations of the East. The custom prevails at the present day, and is often referred to in Scripture (see <a href="/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-15</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. burden&#8212;the prophecy as to, &c.

Some think this begins a new prophecy, and this the name and inscription of it. The Septuagint version is, <p>"the vision of the four footed beasts in the wilderness;'' <p>and Kimchi's note is, <p>"this prophecy, which he prophesied, that the beasts of the south should go out, meaning the beasts of the wilderness, and devour those that went to seek help from Egypt;'' <p>but it respects the same thing as before, as appears by what follows; namely, the messengers going down to Egypt, which lay south of Judea, as Jarchi and Kimchi, Ben Melech and Abarbinel, observe, with beasts carrying riches thither, either for safety, or to obtain help from them: <p>into a land of trouble and anguish; as it had been to their fathers formerly, and would be no otherwise to them now, notwithstanding their high raised expectations of assistance from them; there may be an allusion to its name Mizraim: <p>from whence come the young and old lion, the viper, and fiery flying serpent; creatures with which Egypt abounded, as historians relate, and where some of them, at least, were worshipped, and where also men dwelt comparable to these creatures, as for craft and cruelty; though some understand this not of the country of Egypt, into which they went, but of the desert of Arabia, which lay between Judea and Egypt, through which they went; which was a land of trouble and anguish, for want of water, and because of these noxious creatures, of which it was full; see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>, <p>they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses; which were much used in Judea to carry burdens on, and which were laid chiefly on their shoulders; and this denotes the great quantity of riches that would be, and were carried into Egypt, either by the ambassadors, as presents to the Egyptians, to gain their friendship and assistance; or else by some of the principal inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judea, who, upon hearing of the invasion by Sennacherib, gathered up their riches, and fled to Egypt with them for safety, making use of young asses and camels, as follow: <p>and their treasures upon the bunches of camels; much used in travelling through the deserts of Arabia, and which have some one, some two humps on their backs, whereby they are better fitted to carry burdens. The word is of the singular number, and only used in this place; and has the signification of honey, as the camels hump is so called, as Jarchi from the Talmud (h) says, because, when hurt, it is healed by anointing it with honey; and upon these they carried their money and jewels they had treasured up: <p>to a people that shall not profit them; the Egyptians, who were of no service to the Jews, to free them from the invasion of the Assyrians. <p>(h) Bava Metzia, fol. 38. 1.

These verses are marked as an independent oracle by a heading in the enigmatic style of those in ch. 21, 22.

What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?">Isaiah 22:1</a>, we should expect the superscription to be suggested by some striking phrase in the body of the prophecy. There is, however, nothing in the text as it stands to suggest “beasts of the south.” “The south” means the Negeb, the desert region to the south of Judah, traversed by the Jewish ambassadors on their way to Egypt. The “beasts” might be either the beasts of burden painfully making their way through it (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm" title="The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.">Isaiah 30:6</a></span>) or the wild animals by which it is haunted (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm" title="The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.">Isaiah 30:6</a></span>). That the expression refers to the hippopotamus (<a href="/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15</a>) as a symbol of Egypt is a hazardous speculation. The text is probably corrupt, and Duhm’s suggestion that the title reproduces some lost words at the beginning of the oracle is probably on the right track, although his proposed reconstruction may not command assent.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burden of the beasts of the south</span>. Delitzsch thinks that the Egyptians are intended by the "beasts of the south" - the expression pointing primarily to the hippopotamus, which was an apt emblem of the slow-moving Egyptians. But most commentators regard the "beasts" of this clause as equivalent to the "<span class="accented">young</span> asses and camels" mentioned towards the end of the verse. (On the sense of the word "burden," see the introductory paragraph to <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Into the lane of trouble and anguish</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through a laud</span>. It is not Egypt that is spoken of, but the desert between Judaea and Egypt. The reminiscences of this desert were such that the Israelites always exaggerated its terrors and dangers (see <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come the young and old lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lioness and the lion</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; vol. 1. p. 227). Lions can never have been numerous in the tract in question; but they may have haunted portions of it, when it was better watered than at present. <span class="cmt_word">The viper and fiery flying serpent</span>. Snakes of various kinds have always been abundant in the desert between Judaea and Egypt (<a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>; Strab., 16. p. 759; Schubert,' Travels,' sol. it. p. 406; Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 499, etc.). Seine of them were believed anciently to have wings (Herod., 2:75; 3:107); but the fact is doubted. Isaiah is not concerned with natural history, but with definitely marking out the locality through which the ambassadors would march. For this purpose it was best to describe it in terms drawn from the popular belief. <span class="cmt_word">Their riches... their treasures</span>. Ambassadors who came to request military aid, as a matter of course carried rich presents with them. <span class="cmt_word">Young asses... camels.</span> The ordinary beasts of burden employed in the passage of the desert (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-26.htm">Genesis 42:26</a>; Herod., 3:9, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Everything that was incorrigible would be given up to destruction; and therefore the people of God, when it came out of the judgment, would have nothing of the same kind to look for again. "Therefore thus saith Jehovah of the house of Jacob, He who redeemed Abraham: Jacob shall not henceforth be ashamed, nor shall his face turn pale any more. For when he, when his children see the work of my hands in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shudder before the God of Israel. And those who were of an erring spirit discern understanding, and murmurers accept instruction." With &#1488;&#1500; (for which Luzzatto, following Lowth, reads &#1488;&#1500; sda, "the God of the house of Jacob") the theme is introduced to which the following utterance refers. The end of Israel will correspond to the holy root of its origin. Just as Abraham was separated from the human race that was sunk in heathenism, to become the ancestor of a nation of Jehovah, so would a remnant be separated from the great mass of Israel that was sunk in apostasy from Jehovah; and this remnant would be the foundation of a holy community well pleasing to God. And this would never be confounded or become pale with shame again (on bo&#772;sh, see at <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; cha&#770;var is a poetical Aramaism); for both sins and sinners that called forth the punishments of God, which had put them to shame, would have been swept away (cf., <a href="/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11</a>). In the presence of this decisive work of punishment (ma&#8219;a&#774;seh as in <a href="/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>), which Jehovah would perform in the heart of Israel, Israel itself would undergo a thorough change. &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; is in apposition to the subject in &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, "when he, namely his children" (comp. <a href="/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>); and the expression "his children" is intentionally chosen instead of "his sons" (ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m), to indicate that there would be a new generation, which would become, in the face of the judicial self-manifestation of Jehovah, a holy church, sanctifying Him, the Holy One of Israel. Yaqd&#305;&#772;shu&#772; is continued in vehiqd&#305;&#772;shu&#772;: the prophet intentionally repeats this most significant word, and he&#8219;e&#774;r&#305;&#772;ts is the parallel word to it, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12-13</a>. The new church would indeed not be a sinless one, or thoroughly perfect; but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-24.htm">Isaiah 29:24</a>, the previous self-hardening in error would have been exchanged for a willing and living appropriation of right understanding, and the former murmuring resistance to the admonitions of Jehovah would have given place to a joyful and receptive thirst for instruction. There is the same interchange of Jacob and Israel here which we so frequently met with in chapters 40ff. And, in fact, throughout this undisputedly genuine prophecy of Isaiah, we can detect the language of chapters 40-66. Through the whole of the first part, indeed, we may trace the gradual development of the thoughts and forms which predominate there. </body></html>
