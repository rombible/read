In this case it was the turning from the trust in man, with all its restless excitement, to a trust in God, full of calmness and of peace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/30.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘QUIETNESS AND CONFIDENCE’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ISRAEL always felt the difficulty of sustaining itself on the height of dependence on the unseen, spiritual power of God, and was ever oscillating between alliances with the Northern and Southern powers, linking itself with Assyria against Egypt, or with Egypt against Assyria. The effect was that whichever was victorious it suffered; it was the battleground for both, it was the prize of each in turn. The prophet’s warnings were political wisdom as truly as religious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Here Judah is exhorted to forsake the entangling dependence on Egypt, and to trust wholly to God. They had gone away from Him in their fears. They must come back by their faith. To them the great lesson was trust in God. Through them to us the same lesson is read. The principle is far wider than this one case. It is the one rule of life for us all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The two clauses of the text convey substantially the same idea. They are in inverted parallelism. ‘Returning and rest’ correspond to ‘quietness and confidence,’ so as that ‘rest’ answers to ‘quietness’ and ‘returning’ to ‘confidence.’ In the former clause we have the action towards God and then its consequence. In the latter we have the consequence and then the action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The returning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Men depart from God by speculative thought or by anxious care, or by sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To ‘return’ is just to trust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The parallel helps us here-’returning’ is parallel with ‘confidence.’ This confidence is to be exercised especially in relation to one’s own path in life and the outward trials and difficulties which we meet, but its sphere extends far beyond these. It is a disposition of mind which covers all things. The attitude of trust, the sense of dependence, the assurance of God’s help and love are in all life the secrets of peace and power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Am I sinful? then trust. Am I bewildered and ignorant? then trust. Am I anxious and harassed? then trust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note the thought, that we come back to God by simple confidence, not by preparing ourselves, not by our expiation, but only by trusting in Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Of course the temptations to the opposite attitude are many and great.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, too, that every want of confidence is a departure from God. We go away from Him not only by open sin, not only by denial of Him, but by forgetfulness, by want of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The <span class="ital">ground</span> of this confidence is laid in our knowledge of Him, especially in our knowledge of Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The <span class="ital">exercise</span> of this confidence is treated as voluntary. Every man is responsible for his faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The <span class="ital">elements</span> of this confidence are, as regards ourselves, our sense of want in all its various aspects; and, as regards Him, our assurance of His love, of His nearness to help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Confiding nearness to God brings quiet rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Rest’ and ‘being quiet’ are treated here partly as consequences of faith, partly as duties which we are bound to strive to achieve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. See how confidence in God stills and quiets the soul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The very exercise of communion with Him brings peace and rest, inasmuch as all things are then possessed which we can desire. There is a still fruition which nothing can equal and nothing destroy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Trust in God brings rest from our own evil consciences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It brings rest from our own plans and purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Trust gives insight into the meaning of all this else unintelligible world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It brings the calming and subduing of desires, which in their eagerness torture, in their fruition trouble, and in their disappointment madden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It brings the gathering in of ourselves from all the disturbing diffusion of ourselves through earthly trifles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Notice what this rest is not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It does not mean the absence of causes of disturbance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It does not mean the abnegation of forethought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It does not mean an indolent passiveness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Notice the duty of being thus quiet and resting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How much we fail in this respect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have faith, but there seems some obstruction which stops it from flowing refreshingly through our lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We are bound to seek for its increased continuity and power in our hearts and lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Confidence and rest in God bring safety and strength.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>That is true in the lowest sense of ‘saved,’ and not less true in the highest. The condition of all our salvation from temporal as well as spiritual evils lies thus in the same thing-that we trust God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No harm comes to us when we trust, because then God is with us, and works for us, and cares for us. So all departments of life are bound together by the one law. Trust is the condition of being ‘saved.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And not only so, but also trust is strength. God works <span class="ital">for</span> us; yes, but better than that, God works <span class="ital">in</span> us and fits <span class="ital">us</span> to work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What powers we might be in the world! Trust should make us strong. To have confidence in God should bring us power to which all other power is as nothing. He who can feel that his foot is on the rock, how firm he should stand!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Best gives strength. The rest of faith doubles our forces. To be freed from anxious care makes a man much more likely to act vigorously and to judge wisely.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Stillness of soul, born of communion with God, makes us strong.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Stillness of soul, born of deliverance from our fears, makes us strong.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Here then is a golden chain-or shall we rather say a live wire?- whereof one end is bound to the Throne and the other encircles our poor hearts. Trust, so shall we be at rest and safe. Being at rest and safe, we shall be strong. If we link ourselves with God by faith, God will flash into us His mysterious energy, and His strength will be made perfect in our weakness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not....">Isaiah 30:15-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">In returning </span>— From your present purpose of sending to Egypt; or, as the LXX., the Syriac, and Arabic understand it, in returning to God; <span class="ital">shall ye be saved </span>— Preserved from the power of your enemies. <span class="ital">In quietness and confidence </span>— In a calm and quiet submission to the divine will, and a confidence placed on his mercy, power, and faithfulness; <span class="ital">shall be your strength </span>— Your support under your troubles, and your ability to withstand your invaders. <span class="ital">But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; on</span> <span class="ital">the swift </span>— We will have swift horses from Egypt, that, in case of danger, we may escape from our enemies. It is probable many of the richer sort intended to flee, and perhaps did actually flee into Egypt, having sent their treasures thither before them. <span class="ital">Therefore shall ye flee </span>— Your sin shall be your punishment: you <span class="ital">will </span>flee, and you <span class="ital">shall </span>flee. <span class="ital">One thousand at the rebuke of one </span>— You shall be so dispirited and enervated by your fears, that, instead of one of you <span class="ital">chasing a thousand, </span>as God promised you should do, if you were obedient, a thousand of you shall be chased by one of your enemies. <span class="ital">At the rebuke, </span>or assault, <span class="ital">of five </span>— Of a comparatively small number; <span class="ital">shall ye flee </span>— All of you, however numerous; <span class="ital">till ye be left, </span>&c. — Till ye be generally destroyed, and but a few of you left. “The meaning of the whole period is, that if the Jews, in the uncertain state of their affairs, would abstain from all endeavours to defend themselves by foreign aid, and would commit themselves to the care and providence of God, with settled minds, in faith and hope, they should then be safe, and avoid the calamities which threatened them.” But this they would not do; they were determined to seek for preservation or deliverance from the yoke of the Assyrians in the help of the Egyptians, and therefore it is foretold they should meet with the calamities here mentioned; and “should be seized with such a panic fear that, when they came to the point, they should turn their backs on their enemies, and flee with that swiftness wherewith they had thought to make their enemies flee, insomuch that very few of them should escape the common destruction.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:8-18 The Jews were the only professing people God then had in the world, yet many among them were rebellious. They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord God - The design of this verse is to give a reason for the destruction that should come upon them.

Probably, however, before the invasion had actually commenced he had seen the impropriety of this, either because the aid of Egypt could not be secured, or because Isaiah had warned him of this, and had been brought to put his trust entirely in Yahweh.

This is still repeated, though displeasing to the carnal Jews, who, notwithstanding their ill behaviour to the Lord, condescends to give them the best advice, as follows: <p>in returning and rest shall ye be saved; or "may be saved" (o); this is the right and the only way, namely, by "returning" from their evil ways, particularly their purpose of going to Egypt for help, and by returning to God by repentance and reformation, and to his worship and ordinances; and so the Targum, <p>"if ye return to my law;'' <p>and by "resting" quietly at home, and reposing their trust in the Lord: <p>in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength; in a quiet submission to the will of God, and in quietly waiting upon him for the issue and event of things, abiding in their own houses, and not in a hurrying tumultuous manner, running here and there for help; and in a holy and humble confidence in the Lord, and in the power of his might, where they should find such strength and security, as Pharaoh king of Egypt could not give them: <p>and ye would not; would not be persuaded to keep at home, and from going down to Egypt; would not take the advice given, but pursue their own measures and methods of salvation. This is the literal sense of the words; and if they can be accommodated to spiritual and eternal salvation, it may be done in this way: repentance may be meant by "returning", and faith by "rest"; or by "returning and rest" may be designed returning to rest, that is, to Christ, who is the only rest to weary souls: "quietness" may intend peace of conscience, arising from the blood and righteousness of Christ; and "confidence" faith, and an assurance of it, which make men strong Christians; though their strength does not barely lie in these graces, but in the object of them: now faith and repentance are blessings of the covenant of grace, gifts of God, and graces of the Spirit, which go together in the doctrine of salvation, and have a concern in it; though they are not meritorious procuring causes, nor conditions of it; yet in this way God brings his people to salvation, and they enter into, and are descriptive of, the character of such that are saved; there is so close a connection between these and salvation, that none are saved without them; and it may be observed, that this way of saving men through faith and repentance, and by going to Christ alone for rest, and by placing confidence in, and deriving all peace and comfort from him, is disagreeable to unregenerate men; which is a proof of the wretched depravity, and corruption, and perverseness of the will of man. <p>(o) "servaremini", Piscator, Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thus saith the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.</span><p>(n) Often by his prophets he put you in remembrance of this, that you should only depend on him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15–17</span>.
