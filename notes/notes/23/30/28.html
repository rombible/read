With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his breath - The word &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach properly means "wind," air in motion; then a breathing, an exhalation, a breath; then the soul, spirit, etc. The idea here seems to be that of excited, and rapid, and agitated breathing, as when one is in anger (compare <a href="/judges/8-3.htm">Judges 8:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-8.htm">Zechariah 6:8</a>).<p>As an overflowing stream - This figure is common to express desolating judgments (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>).<p>Shall reach to the midst of the neck - Isaiah Isa 8:8, in describing the invasion of Sennacherib, and comparing it to an oveflowing torrent, says it would 'reach even to the neck;' that is, it would overflow the land, and even approach the head, the capital, but that that would be spared. By the use of a similar figure, and perhaps referring to that, he here says, that the judgment of God would overflow the army of the Assyrians, but that it would approach only to the neck, the head would still be spared; the commander and sovereign would not be destroyed. In accordance with this prediction, the angel in one night, as with an overflowing flood, cut off the army, and yet spared the sovereign, Sennacherib, who escaped with his life <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>. The word rendered 'shall reach' (&#1512;&#1495;&#1510;&#1492;  yeche&#774;tseh) properly means "shall divide," or cut into two parts <a href="/genesis/33-8.htm">Genesis 33:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-37.htm">Numbers 31:37</a>, <a href="/numbers/31-42.htm">Numbers 31:42</a>; <a href="/judges/9-43.htm">Judges 9:43</a>; and the idea here seems to be that a man who is in the water seems to be "divided" into two parts, one part above, and one in the water.<p>To sift the nations - Doubtless many nations were laid under requisition to furnish an army so large as that of Sennaherib, as the kingdom of Assyria was made up of a number of tributary people and provinces. The word rendered 'to sift' refers to the act of winnowing or fanning grain, in which the grain is "tossed" or thrown from the shovel into the air. As the chaff is driven away by the wind, so the nations in the army of Sennacherib would be scattered.<p>With the sieve of vanity - That is, of emptiness or perdition; he would so scatter them that nothing would be left.<p>A bridle in the jaws of the people - The idea is, that he had all these nations as much under his control as a man has a horse with a bridle in his mouth. The same idea the prophet has used in reference to the same subject in <a href="/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a> :<p>I will put my bridle in thy jaws,<p>And I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.<p>Causing them to err - That shall cause them to wander; that is, he would turn them from the path in which they had designed to go. They had purposed to go to Jerusalem, but he would lead them back to their own land, discomfited and disheartened (see <a href="/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

Here, the mouth, in which there is a tongue of fire, sends forth a rush of breath, which is compared to an "overflowing stream, which reaches to the middle of the neck, "and sweeps those who try to cross it away (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>) <span class="cmt_word">To sift the nations with the sieve of vanity</span>.

"For a people continues dwelling in Zion, in Jerusalem; thou shalt not weep for ever: He will prove Himself gracious to thee at the sound of thy cry for help; as soon as He hears, He answers thee. And the Lord giveth you bread in penury, and water for your need; and thy teachers will not hide themselves any more, and thine eyes come to see thy teachers. And thine ears will hear words behind thee, saying, 'This is the way, walk ye in it!' whether ye turn to the right hand or to the left. And ye defile the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the clothing of thy molten images of gold; thou wilt scatter them like filthy thing: 'Get out!' thou sayest to it." We do not render <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>, "For O people that dwelleth in Zion, in Jerusalem!" For although the personal pronoun may be omitted after Vav in an apostrophizing connection (<a href="/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>), we should certainly expect to find &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; here. The accent very properly marks these words as forming an independent clause. The apparent tautology in the expression, "in Zion, in Jerusalem," is emphatic and explanatory. The fate of Zion-Jerusalem will not be the same as that of the imperial city (<a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>); for it is the city of Jehovah, which, according to His promise, cannot become an eternally deserted ruin. After this promising declaration, the prophet turns and addresses the people of the future in the people of his own time; ba&#770;kho&#772; strengthens the verbal notion with the mark of duration; cha&#770;no&#772;n with the mark of certainty and fulness. &#1497;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with an advanced o&#774;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>, for &#1497;&#1495;&#1503;. &#1499;&#1468; is the shortest expression used to denote simultaneous occurrence; answering and hearing would coincide (shom&#8219;a&#770;h, nomen actionis, as in <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>; Ges. 45, 1b; &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;kh, the pausal form here, as in <a href="/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>). From this lowest stage of response to the penitential cry for help, the promise rises higher and higher. The next stage is that in which Jerusalem is brought into all the distress consequent upon a siege, as threatened by the prophet in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; the besieged would not be allowed by God to die of starvation, but He would send them the necessary support. The same expression, but very little altered, viz., "to give to eat lechem lachatz u&#772;mayim lachatz," signifies to put any one upon the low rations of a siege or of imprisonment, in <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/18-26.htm">2 Chronicles 18:26</a>; but here it is a promise, with the threat kept in the background. &#1510;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; are connected with the absolute nouns &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, not as adverbial, but as appositional definitions (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, "wine which is giddiness," in <a href="/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "water which is knees," i.e., which has the measure of the knees, where birkayim is also in apposition, and not the accusative of measurement): literally, bread which is necessity, and water which is affliction; that is to say, nourishment of which there is extreme need, the very opposite of bread and water in abundance. Umbreit and Drechsler understand this spiritually. But the promise rises as it goes on. There is already an advance, in the fact that the faithful and well-meaning teachers (mo&#772;r&#305;&#772;m) no longer keep themselves hidden because of the hard-heartedness and hatred of the people, as they have done ever since the time of Ahaz (&#1504;&#1499;&#1504;&#1507;, a denom.: to withdraw into &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;, the utmost end, the most secret corner; though ka&#770;naph in itself signifies to cover or conceal). Israel, when penitent, would once more be able to rejoice in the sight of those whom it longed to have back again. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is a plural, according to the context (on the singular of the previous predicate, see Ges. 147). As the shepherds of the flock, they would follow the people with friendly words of admonition, whilst the people would have their ears open to receive their instruction. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is here equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. The abominations of idolatry (which continued even in the first years of Hezekiah's reign: <a href="/isaiah/31-7.htm">Isaiah 31:7</a>; <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11-13</a>; <a href="/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>) would now be regarded as abominations, and put away. Even gold and silver, with which the images that were either carved or cast in inferior metal were overlaid, would be made unclean (see <a href="/2_kings/28-8.htm">2 Kings 28:8</a>ff.); that is to say, no use would be made of them. Da&#770;va&#770;h is a shorter expression for kel&#305;&#772; da&#770;va&#770;h, the cloth worn by a woman at the monthly period. On za&#770;ra&#770;h, to dispense - to which da&#770;va&#770;h would be inappropriate if understood of the woman herself, as it is by Luzzatto - compare <a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>. With &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, the plural used in the general address passes over into the individualizing singular; &#1500;&#1493; is to be taken as a neuter pointing back to the plunder of idols. </body></html>
