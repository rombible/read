Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The young donkeys that ear the ground - Hebrew, 'Labouring,' or 'cultivating the ground,' that is, plowing it. The Old English word "ear" (from the Latin aro) meant to till, to cultivate. The word is now obselete, but this is the sense which it has in the Bible <a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>.<p>Shall eat clean provender - Margin, 'Leavened,' or 'savory.' The word rendered 'provender' (&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;  bel&#305;&#770;yl) is a verbal from &#1489;&#1500;&#1500;  ba&#770;lal, "to mix, mingle, confuse;" and denotes provender that is made by "mixing" various substances, "maslin" or "farago," a mixture of barley, oats, vetches, and beans, which seem to have been sown together, and reaped at the same time <a href="/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>; <a href="/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>. The word rendered 'clean,' (&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1509;  cha&#770;miyts) is not quite so plain in its signification. Kimchi explains it by &#1504;&#1511;&#1497;  na&#770;qiy, "pure, clean." Gesenius renders it 'salted,' and supposes that it refers to fodder that was mixed with salted hay. The Septuagint renders it, 'Provender mixed with winnowed barley.' But the real notion of the word is that which is "fermented," from &#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1509;  cha&#770;me&#772;ts, "to be sour;" to be leavened. Lowth renders it, 'well fermented.' Noyes, 'well seasoned.' The idea seems to be that of a provender made of a mixture of various substances - as of grain, beans, vetches, herbs, hay, and probably salt, which, when mixed, "would" ferment, and which was regarded as nutritious and wholesome for cattle. A similar compound is used by the Arabs still (see Bochart, i. 2, 7; and Faber, and Harmer's "Observations," i.409).<p>Which hath been winnowed - That is, which is the pure grain, which is not fed to them as it is sometimes, before it is separated from the chaff. Grain shall be so abundant in that time of prosperity that even the cattle may be fed with grain prepared as it is usually for man.<p>With the shovel - The large shovel by which the grain in the chaff was thrown up in the wind that the grain might be separated from the chaff.<p>The fan - This word properly means that by which anything is "scattered" - a shovel by which the grain is thrown or tossed into the wind. 'Those who form their opinion of the latter article by an English fan, will entertain a very erroneous notion. That of the East is made of the fibrous part of the palmirah or cocoa-tree leaves, and measures about a yard each way.'

Now this is expressive of great plenty, that cattle should feed on winnowed corn. The Septuagint indeed render it, <p>"they shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley;'' <p>but if they were to eat chaff with it, there would be no need to winnow it. This may be mystically understood of apostles, and of apostolical men, as Jerom; and of all Gospel preachers, especially in the latter day, who labour in the word and doctrine, and feed upon the pure food of the Gospel themselves, and bring it to others; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-9.htm">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

The devotion of cattle to salt in any form is well known. Gesenius quotes an Arabic proverb which says that “sweet fodder is the camel’s bread, salted fodder is his comfit.” The word for “fodder” (<span class="ital">bělîl</span>) is usually explained as “mixture” (<span class="ital">farrago</span>) of corn with beans, vetches, &c.

The thought of the prophet is the perpetually recurring one, that Israel would have to be reduced to a small remnant before Jehovah would cease from His wrath. "And therefore will Jehovah wait till He inclines towards you, and therefore will He withdraw Himself on high till He has mercy upon you; for Jehovah is a God of right, salvation to those who wait for Him." In other places la&#770;khe&#772;n (therefore) deduces the punishment from the sin; here it infers, from the nature of the punishment, the long continuance of the divine wrath. Chikka&#770;h, to wait, connected as it is here with Lamed, has at least the idea, if not the actual signification, of delay (as in <a href="/2_kings/9-3.htm">2 Kings 9:3</a>; compare <a href="/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>). This helps to determine the sense of ya&#770;ru&#772;m, which does not mean, He will show Himself exalted as a judge, that through judgment He may render it possible to have mercy upon you (which is too far-fetched a meaning); but, He will raise Himself up, so as to be far away (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-45.htm">Numbers 16:45</a>, "Get you up from among this congregation;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>, ma&#770;ro&#772;m  equals  "far above," as far as heaven, out of his sight), that thus (after having for a long time withdrawn His gracious presence; cf., <a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>) He may bestow His mercy upon you. A dark prospect, but only alarming to unbelievers. The salvation at the remotest end of the future belongs to believers even now. This is affirmed in the word 'ashre&#772; (blessed), which recalls <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>. The prophet uses cha&#770;kha&#770;h in a very significant double sense here, just as he did nuus a short time before. Jehovah is waiting for the time when He can show His favour once more, and blessed are they who meet His waiting with their own waiting. </body></html>
