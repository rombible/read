The vision opens here; and the first thing which the prophet hears, is the solemn command of God addressed to the nations as subject to him, to rear the standard of war, and to gather around it the mighty armies which were to be employed in the destruction of the city. This command, 'Lift ye up a banner,' is addressed to the leaders of those armies to assemble them, and to prepare them for war.<p>Upon the high mountain - It was customary for military leaders to plant a standard on a tower, a fortress, a city, a high mountain, or any elevated spot, in order that it might be seen afar, and be the rallying point for the people to collect together (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>). Here, the prophet does not refer to any particular "mountain," but means simply, that a standard should be raised, around which the hosts should be assembled to march to Babylon. The Chaldee renders it, 'Over the city dwelling in security, lift up the banner.'<p>Exalt the voice - Raise up the voice, commanding the people to assemble, and to prepare for the march against Babylon, Perhaps, however, the word 'voice' here (&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;  qo&#770;l) refers to the "clangor," or sound, of a trumpet used for mustering armies. The word is often used to denote "any" noise, and is frequently applied to thunder, to the trumpet, etc.<p>Unto them - That is, to the Medes and Persians, who were to be employed in the destruction of Babylon.<p>Shake the hand - In the way of beckoning; as when one is at so great a distance that the voice cannot be heard, the hand is waved for a sign. This was a command to beckon to the nations to assemble for the destruction of Babylon.<p>That they may go into the gates of the nobles - The word rendered here 'nobles' (&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;  ned&#305;&#770;yb&#305;&#770;ym) means, properly, "voluntary, free, liberal;" then those who are noble, or liberally-minded, from the connection between nobleness and liberality; then those who are noble or elevated in rank or office. In this sense it is used here; compare <a href="/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>; <a href="/job/34-18.htm">Job 34:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-16.htm">Proverbs 8:16</a>, where it is rendered 'princes;' <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>, where it is rendered 'nobles.' Lowth renders it here 'princes.' Noyes renders it 'tyrants ' - a sense which the word has in <a href="/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a> (see the note at that place). There is no doubt that it refers to Babylon; and the prophet designs probably to speak of Babylon as a magnificent city - a city of princes, or nobles. The Chaldee renders it, 'That they may enter its gates, which open to them of their own accord;' retaining the original signification of "voluntariness" in the Hebrew word, and expressing the idea that the conquest would be easy. Our common translation has expressed the correct sense. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Or "upon the mountain Nishphah"; some high mountain in Media or Persia, proper to set a standard on, or erect a banner for the gathering men together, to enlist themselves as soldiers, and so form an army to march into the land of Chaldea. Vitringa thinks there may be an allusion to the mountain Zagrius, which divides Media and Persia from Assyria, mentioned by Strabo (x). Or "upon a high mountain"; any high mountain fit for such a purpose; or "against the high mountain", as some (y) read it; meaning Babylon, called a mountain, <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a> not because of its situation, for it was in a plain; but because of its eminence above other cities and states. The Targum is, <p>"against the city that dwells securely, lift up a sign;'' <p>a token of war, proclaim war against it, that lives at ease, and is in peace; and so the word is used in the Talmudic language, as Kimchi observes; and to this agrees Jarchi's note, <p>"to gather against the mountain that is quiet, and trusts in its tranquillity, lift up a banner to the nations.'' <p>Exalt the voice unto them; the Medes, mentioned by name in <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a> such as were within call, or were gathered together by the lifting up of the banner; such were to be urged with great vehemency to enlist themselves, and engage in a war against Babylon: <p>shake the hand; beckon with it to them that are afar off, that cannot hear the voice: <p>that they may go into the gates of the nobles; that dwell in the city of Babylon, where they might expect to find rich plunder; though some understand this of the nobles or princes of the Medes and Persians, as Kimchi observes, that should enter through the gates of Babylon into the city; and by others it is interpreted of the soldiers coming to the doors of the leaders or generals of the army, to give in their names, and enlist themselves in their service; which well agrees with what goes before. <p>(x) Geograph. l. 11. p. 359.

"And in that day thou wilt say, I thank Thee, O Jehovah, that Thou wast angry with me: Thine anger is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me. Behold, the God of my salvation; I trust, and am not afraid: for Jah Jehovah is my pride and song, and He became my salvation." The words are addressed to the people of the future in the people of the prophet's own time. They give thanks for the wrath experienced, inasmuch as it was followed by all the richer consolation. The formation of the sentence after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is paratactic; the principal tone falls upon 1b, where ya&#770;sho&#772;b is written poetically for vayya&#770;shob (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>). We hear the notes of <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, resounding here; whilst <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a> is the echo of <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> (on which <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> is also founded). &#1506;&#1494;&#1497; (to be read &#8219;ozzi, and therefore also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1497;) is another form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, and is used here to signify the proud self-consciousness associated with the possession of power: pride, and the expression of it, viz., boasting. Zimrath is equivalent in sense, and probably also in form, to zimra&#770;ti, just as in Syriac zemori (my song) is regularly pronounced zemo&#772;r, with the i of the suffix dropped (see Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>). It is also possible, however, that it may be only an expansion of the primary form zimrath  equals  zimra&#770;h, and therefore that zimrath is only synonymous with zimra&#770;ti, as che&#772;phetz in <a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a> is with chephtzi. One thing peculiar to this echo of <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> is the doubling of the Jah in Ja&#770;h Jeho&#772;va&#770;h, which answers to the surpassing of the type by the antitype. </body></html>
