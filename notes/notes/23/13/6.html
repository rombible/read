The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, Re 18:4. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape.

These words are an address to the Babylonians, who instead of rejoicing and feasting, as Belshazzar and his nobles were the night that Babylon was taken, had reason to howl and lament; seeing the day that the Lord had fixed for their destruction was very near, and he was just about to come forth as a judge to take vengeance on them; for though it was about two hundred and fifty years from the time of this prophecy, to the taking of Babylon, yet it is represented as at hand, to show the certainty of it, both for the comfort of the Jewish captives, when they should be in it, and for the awakening of the sluggish inhabitants, who were secure, and thought themselves out of danger: <p>it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty: suddenly, swiftly, and irresistibly: there is a beautiful paronomasia in the Hebrew text, "ceshod mishaddai" (c); as destruction from the destroyer; from God, who is able to save, and to destroy; he is almighty and all sufficient, so some render the word; the hand of God was visible in it. <p>(c) . <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wail <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> ye; for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span><p>(f) You Babylonians.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. The verse is almost identical with <a href="/joel/1-15.htm" title="Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.">Joel 1:15</a>. On the “day of Jehovah” see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as a destruction from the Almighty</span>] The Heb. phrase contains an alliteration which cannot be easily reproduced in English. The Germans render “wie Gewalt vom Gewaltigen.” The word for “Almighty” is the Divine name <span class="ital">Shaddai</span> (see <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a>), but its etymology is doubtful. According to one derivation it comes from the same root as the word for “destruction,” so that we might almost venture to translate “like destruction from the Destroyer.” This verse, however, can hardly be appealed to in support of that view, since it may imply nothing beyond the mere play upon words. (See further Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Old Test. in Jewish Church</span>, pp. 423 f.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand</span> (comp. <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>); literally, the expression used in both passages is <span class="accented">a day of Jehovah</span>. The idiom would not, however, allow the use of the article, so that the phrase is ambiguous. "The day of Jehovah" is properly "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient" (Cheyne). But any great occasion when God passes judgment on a nation is called in Scripture "a day of the Lord." "a coming of Christ." And so here the day of the judgment upon Babylon seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span> Isaiah is thought to quote from Joel (<a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>) here; but perhaps both prophets quoted from an earlier author. Shaddai (equivalent to "Almighty') is an ancient name of God, most rarely used by the prophetical writers (only here, and in <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>; <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>), and never elsewhere by either Isaiah or Joel. It has generally been said to mean "the Strong One;" but recently the theory has found favor that it meant originally "the Sender of storms," from the Arabic <span class="accented">sh'da - jecit</span>, <span class="accented">effudit</span>. However this may be, the word is certainly used in the later times mainly to express God's power to visit and punish, and the present passage might perhaps be best translated, "It shall come as a destruction from the Destroyer (<span class="accented">k'shod mish-Shaddai yabo</span>)." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, again, contains a prophetic promise, which points back to the commencement of <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a> : "And with rapture ye will draw water out of the wells of salvation." Just as Israel was miraculously supplied with water in the desert, so will the God of salvation, who has become your salvation, open many and manifold sources of salvation for you (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; as it is pointed here, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;,<p>(Note: The root is the same as, for example, in &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493; (they rejoice) and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;; here, however, it is more striking, because the singular is written &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, and not &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;. At the same time, it is evident that the connecting sound ay was rather preferred than avoided, as Ewald maintains - as we may see, for example, from the repeated aychi in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>.))<p>from which ye may draw with and according to your heart's delight. This water of salvation, then, forms both the material for, and instigation to, new songs of praise; and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-4.htm">Isaiah 12:4-6</a> therefore continue in the strain of a psalm: "And ye will say in that day, Praise Jehovah, proclaim His name, make known His doings among the nations, boast that His name is exalted. Harp to Jehovah; for He has displayed majesty: let this be known in all lands. Shout and be jubilant, O inhabitants of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee." The first song of six lines is here followed by a second of seven lines: a prophetic word of promise, inserted between them, separates the one from the other. This second also commences with the well-known tones of a psalm (compare especially <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm">1 Chronicles 16:8</a>). The phrase, "Call upon the name of Jehovah," signifies, Make the name of Jehovah the medium of invocation (Ges. 138, Anm. 3*), i.e., invoke it, or, as here, call it out. Ge&#772;'u&#772;th is high, towering dignity; here it is used of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, with &#8219;a&#770;sa&#770;h: to prove it practically, just as with la&#772;be&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, to show one's self openly therein. Instead of the Chethib meyudda&#8219;ath in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-5.htm">Isaiah 12:5</a>, the keri substitutes the hophal form mu&#772;da&#8219;ath, probably because meyudda&#770;&#8219;, according to the standing usage of speech, denotes one well known, or intimate; the passive of the hophal is certainly the more suitable. According to the preceding appeals, the words are to be understood as expressing a desire, that the glorious self-attestation of the God of salvation might be brought to the consciousness of the whole of the inhabitants of the earth, i.e., of all mankind. When God redeems His people, He has the salvation of all the nations in view. It is the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel, made known through the word of proclamation, that brings salvation to them all. How well may the church on Zion rejoice, to have such a God dwelling in the midst of it! He is great as the giver or promises, and great in fulfilling them; great in grace, and great in judgment; great in all His saving acts which spread from Israel to all mankind. Thus does this second psalm of the redeemed nation close, and with it the book of Immanuel. </body></html>
