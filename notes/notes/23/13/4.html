This is a highly beautiful figure - a graphic and vivid representation of the scene before him. Nations are seen to hasten to the elevated banner, and to engage in active preparations for the mighty war. The sound is that of a tumult, an excited multitude hastening to the encampment, and preparing for the conquest of Babylon.<p>Like as of a great people - Hebrew, 'The likeness of a great people.' That is, such a confused and tumultuous sound as attends a great multitude when they collect together.<p>A tumultuous noise - Hebrew, 'The voice of the tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together.'<p>The Lord of hosts - Yahweh, the God of hosts, or armies (note <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>).<p>Mustereth - Collects; puts in military array. Over all this multitude of nations, hastening with confused sounds and tumult like the noise of the sea, putting themselves in military array, God, unseen, presides, and prepares them for his own great designs. It is not easy to conceive a more sublime image than these mighty hosts of war, unconscious of the hand that directs them, and of the God that presides over them, moving as he wills, and accomplishing his plans. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. the mountains&#8212;namely, which separate Media and Assyria, and on one of which the banner to rally the hosts is supposed to be reared.<p>tumultuous noise&#8212;The Babylonians are vividly depicted as hearing some unwonted sound like the din of a host; they try to distinguish the sounds, but can only perceive a tumultuous noise.<p>nations&#8212;Medes, Persians, and Armenians composed Cyrus' army.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The kingdoms of nations; </span> the Medes and Persians, and other nations which served under them in this war; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/25-14.htm" title="For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.">Jeremiah 25:14</a> 27:7 50:41</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people,....

Jeremiah connects the invading army which destroyed Babylon with mountains, when he derives it from. Ararat (comp. <a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>), Minni (Armenia), and Ashchenaz (<a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>).

Just as Israel was miraculously supplied with water in the desert, so will the God of salvation, who has become your salvation, open many and manifold sources of salvation for you (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; as it is pointed here, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;,<p>(Note: The root is the same as, for example, in &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493; (they rejoice) and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;; here, however, it is more striking, because the singular is written &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, and not &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;. At the same time, it is evident that the connecting sound ay was rather preferred than avoided, as Ewald maintains - as we may see, for example, from the repeated aychi in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>.))<p>from which ye may draw with and according to your heart's delight. This water of salvation, then, forms both the material for, and instigation to, new songs of praise; and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-4.htm">Isaiah 12:4-6</a> therefore continue in the strain of a psalm: "And ye will say in that day, Praise Jehovah, proclaim His name, make known His doings among the nations, boast that His name is exalted. Harp to Jehovah; for He has displayed majesty: let this be known in all lands. Shout and be jubilant, O inhabitants of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee." The first song of six lines is here followed by a second of seven lines: a prophetic word of promise, inserted between them, separates the one from the other. This second also commences with the well-known tones of a psalm (compare especially <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm">1 Chronicles 16:8</a>). The phrase, "Call upon the name of Jehovah," signifies, Make the name of Jehovah the medium of invocation (Ges. 138, Anm. 3*), i.e., invoke it, or, as here, call it out. Ge&#772;'u&#772;th is high, towering dignity; here it is used of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, with &#8219;a&#770;sa&#770;h: to prove it practically, just as with la&#772;be&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, to show one's self openly therein. Instead of the Chethib meyudda&#8219;ath in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-5.htm">Isaiah 12:5</a>, the keri substitutes the hophal form mu&#772;da&#8219;ath, probably because meyudda&#770;&#8219;, according to the standing usage of speech, denotes one well known, or intimate; the passive of the hophal is certainly the more suitable. According to the preceding appeals, the words are to be understood as expressing a desire, that the glorious self-attestation of the God of salvation might be brought to the consciousness of the whole of the inhabitants of the earth, i.e., of all mankind. When God redeems His people, He has the salvation of all the nations in view. It is the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel, made known through the word of proclamation, that brings salvation to them all. How well may the church on Zion rejoice, to have such a God dwelling in the midst of it! He is great as the giver or promises, and great in fulfilling them; great in grace, and great in judgment; great in all His saving acts which spread from Israel to all mankind. Thus does this second psalm of the redeemed nation close, and with it the book of Immanuel. </body></html>
