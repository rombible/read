Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.">Isaiah 23:1</a>, indicates that we have in this division a collection of prophetic utterances, bearing upon the future of the surrounding nations, among which Babylon was naturally pre-eminent. The authenticity of the first of these oracles has been questioned, partly on the ground of differences of style, partly because it seems to anticipate the future destruction of Babylon with a distinctness which implies a prophecy after the event. The first of these objections rests, as will be seen from the numerous coincidences between these and other portions of Isaiah, on no sufficient evidence. The second implies a view of prophecy which excludes the element of a divinely given foreknowledge; and that view the present writer does not accept.<p>Accepting the two chapters as Isaiah’s, we have to ask how Babylon came at the time within the prophet’s historical horizon, and what were at the time its political relations with Assyria. (1) It is obvious that the negotiations which Ahaz had opened with Tiglath-pileser, the passage to and fro of armies and ambassadors, the journeys of prophets like Jonah and Nahum, the commerce of which we have traces even in the days of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>), must have made Babylon, as well as Nineveh, familiar to the leading men of Judah. As a matter of fact, it was probably more familiar. Babylon was the older, more famous, more splendid city Nineveh (if we accept the conclusions of one school of historians) had been overpowered and destroyed by the Medes under Arbaces, and the Babylonians under Belesis (B.C. 739), the Pul of Bible history, under whom Assyria was a dependency of Babylon (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Anc. Hist., </span>p. 38). In Tiglath-pileser the Assyrians found a ruler who restored their supremacy. The Chaldæans, however, revolted under Merôdach-baladan, and Sargon records with triumph how he had conquered him and spoiled his palace. As the result of that victory, he took the title of king of Babylon. Merôdach-baladan, however, renewed his resistance early in the reign of Sennacherib, and though again defeated, we find him courting the alliance of Hezekiah either before or after the destruction of that king’s army (Isaiah 39). We can scarcely doubt that the thought of a Babylonian, as of an Egyptian, alliance had presented itself to the minds of the statesmen of Judah as a means of staying the progress of Assyrian conquests. The chapters now before us, however, do not seem written with reference to such an alliance, and in <a href="/isaiah/14-25.htm" title="That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.">Isaiah 14:25</a> Babylon seems contemplated chiefly as the representative of the power of Assyria. It seems probable, accordingly, that the king of Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a> is to be identified with Sargon, the Assyrian king, who took the title of “Vicar of the Gods in Babylon” (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. xi. 17).<p>The word “burden,” prefixed to this and the following prophecies, is a literal translation of the Hebrew. It seems to have acquired a half-technical sense as announcing the doom which a nation or a man was called to bear, and so to have acquired the meaning of an “oracle,” or “prophecy.” This meaning, which is first prominent in Isaiah (in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm" title="The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal,">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm" title="The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.">Proverbs 31:1</a> it is used of an ethical or didactic utterance thought of as inspired), was afterwards given to it in the speeches of the false prophets (<a href="/lamentations/2-14.htm" title="Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you: and they have not discovered your iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but have seen for you false burdens and causes of banishment.">Lamentations 2:14</a>); and in <a href="/context/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:33-40</a> we have a striking play upon the primary and derived meaning of the word. (See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:33</a>.) It continued in use, however, in spite of Jeremiah’s protest, and appears in <a href="/zechariah/9-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.">Malachi 1:1</a>. <span class= "ital">Oracle </span>is perhaps the best English equivalent.

The original word, <span class="greekheb">משׂא</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">burden, </span>is, by Dr. Waterland, after Vitringa, translated, <span class="ital">The sentence upon, </span>or, <span class="ital">delivered concerning Babylon. </span>It is “derived from a verb, which signifies to <span class="ital">take, </span>or <span class="ital">lift up, </span>or <span class="ital">bring; </span>and the proper meaning of it is, any weighty, important matter or sentence, which ought not to be neglected, but is worthy of being carried in the memory, and deserves to be lifted up, and uttered with emphasis.” See <a href="/revelation/2-24.htm" title="But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.">Revelation 2:24</a>, and Vitringa. Bishop Newton and others have observed, that “the prophecies uttered against any city or country, often carry the inscription of <span class="ital">the burden </span>of that city or country: and that by <span class="ital">burden </span>is commonly understood a threatening, burdensome prophecy, big with ruin and destruction: which, like a dead weight, is hung upon the city or country to sink it.” But it appears that the word is of more general import, and sometimes signifies a prophecy at large, sometimes a prophecy of good as well as of evil, as in <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a>; and sometimes, where the original word is used, it is translated <span class="ital">prophecy, </span>where there is no prophecy, but only a grave moral sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This prophecy against Babylon, which consists of two parts, the former contained in this chapter, the latter in the next, was probably delivered, as Vitringa has shown, in the reign of Ahaz, about two hundred years before the completion of it, and a hundred and thirty before the Jews were even carried captive to Babylon; which captivity the prophet does not expressly foretel here, but supposes, in the spirit of prophecy, as what was actually to take place. “And the Medes, who are expressly mentioned, <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a>, as the principal agents in the overthrow of the Babylonian monarchy, by which the Jews were to be released from that captivity, were at this time an inconsiderable people; having been in a state of anarchy ever since the fall of the great Assyrian empire, of which they had made a part under Sardanapalus; and did not become a kingdom till about the seventeenth of Hezekiah.” — Bishop Lowth. The great design of God in inspiring his prophet with the knowledge of these future events, and exciting him to deliver these prophecies concerning them, seems to have been, 1st, To set forth the reasons of his justice, in punishing the enemies of his church, in order to console the minds and confirm the faith of the pious. 2d, With respect to this prophecy especially, concerning the destruction of Babylon, the design was to comfort the minds of true believers against that sad and sorrowful event, the Babylonish captivity. And, 3d, Under the figure of that destruction, to announce the destruction of the spiritual Babylon, the whole kingdom of sin and Satan. See Vitringa, and <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The former part of this prophecy,” says Bishop Lowth, “is one of the most beautiful examples that can be given, of elegance of composition, variety of imagery, and sublimity of sentiment and diction, in the prophetic style: and the latter part consists of an ode of supreme and singular excellence. The prophecy opens with the command of God to gather together the forces which he had destined to his service, <a href="/context/isaiah/13-2.htm" title="Lift you up a banner on the high mountain, exalt the voice to them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles....">Isaiah 13:2-3</a>.

This prophecy is introduced in a different manner from those which have preceded. The terms which Isaiah employed in the commencement of his previous prophecies, were vision (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), or word <a href="/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a>. There has been considerable diversity of opinion in regard to the meaning of the word 'burden,' which is here employed. The Vulgate renders it, Onus - 'Burden,' in the sense of load. The Septuagint &#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  Horasis - 'Vision.' The Chaldee, 'The burden of the cup of malediction which draws near to Babylon.' The Hebrew word &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;  mas's'a&#770;', from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;  na&#770;s'a&#770;', to lift, to raise up, to bear, to bear away, to suffer, to endure"), means properly that which is borne; that which is heavy; that which becomes a burden; and it is also applied to a gift or present, as that which is borne to a man <a href="/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>.<p>It is also applied to a proverb or maxim, probably from the "weight" and "importance" of the sentiment condensed in it <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>. It is applied to an oracle from God <a href="/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25</a>. It is often translated 'burden' <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-33.htm">Jeremiah 23:33-34</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/23-38.htm">Jeremiah 23:38</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>. By comparing these places, it will be found that the term is applied to those oracles or prophetic declarations which contain sentiments especially weighty and solemn; which are employed chiefly in denouncing wrath and calamity; and which, therefore, are represented as weighing down, or oppressing the mind and heart of the prophet. A similar useage prevails in all languages. We are all familiar with expressions like this. We speak of news or tidings of so melancholy a nature as to weigh down, to sink, or depress our spirits; so heavy that we can scarcely bear up under it, or endure it. And so in this case, the view which the prophet had of the awful judgments of God and of the calamities which were coming upon guilty cities and nations, was so oppressive, that it weighed down the mind and heart as a heavy burden. Others, however, suppose that it means merely a message or prophecy which is taken up, or borne, respecting a place, and that the word indicates nothing in regard to the nature of the message. So Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and Cocceius, understand it. But it seems some the former interpretation is to be preferred. Grotins renders it, 'A mournful prediction respecting Babylon.'<p>Did see - Saw in a vision; or in a scenical representation. The various events were made to pass before his mind in a vision, and he was permitted to see the armies mustered; the consternation of the people; and the future condition of the proud city.

The A.V., following several ancient versions, takes it in its commoner sense of “burden” (thing lifted), a confusion which seems as old as the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:33-40</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm" title="Say you to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.">Ezekiel 12:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which Isaiah … did see</span>] See on <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Israel, when redeemed from Egypt beyond the Red Sea, sang songs of praise, so also will the Israel of the second redemption, when brought, in a no less miraculous manner, across the Red Sea and the Euphrates. "And in that day thou wilt say, I thank Thee, O Jehovah, that Thou wast angry with me: Thine anger is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me. Behold, the God of my salvation; I trust, and am not afraid: for Jah Jehovah is my pride and song, and He became my salvation." The words are addressed to the people of the future in the people of the prophet's own time. They give thanks for the wrath experienced, inasmuch as it was followed by all the richer consolation. The formation of the sentence after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is paratactic; the principal tone falls upon 1b, where ya&#770;sho&#772;b is written poetically for vayya&#770;shob (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>). We hear the notes of <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, resounding here; whilst <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a> is the echo of <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> (on which <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> is also founded). &#1506;&#1494;&#1497; (to be read &#8219;ozzi, and therefore also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1497;) is another form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, and is used here to signify the proud self-consciousness associated with the possession of power: pride, and the expression of it, viz., boasting. Zimrath is equivalent in sense, and probably also in form, to zimra&#770;ti, just as in Syriac zemori (my song) is regularly pronounced zemo&#772;r, with the i of the suffix dropped (see Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>). It is also possible, however, that it may be only an expansion of the primary form zimrath  equals  zimra&#770;h, and therefore that zimrath is only synonymous with zimra&#770;ti, as che&#772;phetz in <a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a> is with chephtzi. One thing peculiar to this echo of <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> is the doubling of the Jah in Ja&#770;h Jeho&#772;va&#770;h, which answers to the surpassing of the type by the antitype. </body></html>
