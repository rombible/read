Both Media and Persia were "far countries" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, "from the end of heaven" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">The weapons</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:25; 51:20). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy the whole land.</span> Many critics would render <span class="accented">ha-arets</span> by "the earth" here. It may be granted that the language of the prophecy goes beyond the occasion in places (especially vers. 11 and 13), and passes from Babylon to that wicked world of which Babylon is a type; but, where the context permits, it seems better to restrict than to expand the meaning of the words employed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, again, contains a prophetic promise, which points back to the commencement of <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a> : "And with rapture ye will draw water out of the wells of salvation." Just as Israel was miraculously supplied with water in the desert, so will the God of salvation, who has become your salvation, open many and manifold sources of salvation for you (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; as it is pointed here, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;,<p>(Note: The root is the same as, for example, in &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493; (they rejoice) and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;; here, however, it is more striking, because the singular is written &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, and not &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;. At the same time, it is evident that the connecting sound ay was rather preferred than avoided, as Ewald maintains - as we may see, for example, from the repeated aychi in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>.))<p>from which ye may draw with and according to your heart's delight. This water of salvation, then, forms both the material for, and instigation to, new songs of praise; and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-4.htm">Isaiah 12:4-6</a> therefore continue in the strain of a psalm: "And ye will say in that day, Praise Jehovah, proclaim His name, make known His doings among the nations, boast that His name is exalted. Harp to Jehovah; for He has displayed majesty: let this be known in all lands. Shout and be jubilant, O inhabitants of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee." The first song of six lines is here followed by a second of seven lines: a prophetic word of promise, inserted between them, separates the one from the other. This second also commences with the well-known tones of a psalm (compare especially <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm">1 Chronicles 16:8</a>). The phrase, "Call upon the name of Jehovah," signifies, Make the name of Jehovah the medium of invocation (Ges. 138, Anm. 3*), i.e., invoke it, or, as here, call it out. Ge&#772;'u&#772;th is high, towering dignity; here it is used of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, with &#8219;a&#770;sa&#770;h: to prove it practically, just as with la&#772;be&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, to show one's self openly therein. Instead of the Chethib meyudda&#8219;ath in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-5.htm">Isaiah 12:5</a>, the keri substitutes the hophal form mu&#772;da&#8219;ath, probably because meyudda&#770;&#8219;, according to the standing usage of speech, denotes one well known, or intimate; the passive of the hophal is certainly the more suitable. According to the preceding appeals, the words are to be understood as expressing a desire, that the glorious self-attestation of the God of salvation might be brought to the consciousness of the whole of the inhabitants of the earth, i.e., of all mankind. When God redeems His people, He has the salvation of all the nations in view. It is the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel, made known through the word of proclamation, that brings salvation to them all. How well may the church on Zion rejoice, to have such a God dwelling in the midst of it! He is great as the giver or promises, and great in fulfilling them; great in grace, and great in judgment; great in all His saving acts which spread from Israel to all mankind. Thus does this second psalm of the redeemed nation close, and with it the book of Immanuel. </body></html>
