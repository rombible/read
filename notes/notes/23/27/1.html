The “sword of the Lord” (primarily, perhaps, representing the lightning-flash) is turned in its threefold character as sore, and swift, and strong, against three great empires. These are represented, as in <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:">Ezekiel 17:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a> <a href="/context/daniel/7-3.htm" title="And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.">Daniel 7:3-7</a>, by monstrous forms of animal life.

By some commentators, however, Egypt is represented in all three clauses; while others (Cheyne) see in them the symbols not of earthly empire, but of rebel powers of evil and darkness, quoting <a href="/context/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12-13</a> in support of his view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In that day, </span>&c. — This verse, which Bishop Lowth considers as being connected with the last two verses of the preceding chapter, is translated by him as follows: “In that day shall Jehovah punish with his sword; his well-tempered, and great, and strong sword; Leviathan the rigid serpent, and Leviathan the winding serpent: and shall slay the monster that is in the sea.” And he observes, “The animals here mentioned seem to be, <span class="ital">the crocodile, </span>rigid, by the stiffness of the back-bone, so that he cannot readily turn himself when he pursues his prey; hence the easiest way of escaping from him is by making frequent and short turnings: <span class="ital">the serpent, </span>or <span class="ital">dragon, </span>flexible and winding, which coils himself up in a circular form; <span class="ital">the sea-monster, </span>or <span class="ital">the whale. </span>These are used allegorically, without doubt, for great potentates, enemies and persecutors of the people of God; but to specify the particular persons or states designed by the prophet under these images, is a matter of great difficulty.” Vitringa, who considers the prophecy contained in verse 19 of the preceding chapter, as referring to the deliverance granted to the Jews under the Maccabees, thinks that by the first two of these creatures, <span class="ital">the piercing, </span>or <span class="ital">rigid serpent, </span>and <span class="ital">the crooked, </span>or <span class="ital">winding serpent, </span>“the kingdoms of Egypt and Assyria are meant, as they existed after the times of Alexander the Great; and by <span class="ital">the whale, </span>the kingdom of Arabia, and the other neighbouring nations, which were adversaries to the people of God; or that by these three animals are to be understood the persecutors and adversaries of the church, who should exist successively in the world, and be destroyed by the divine judgments.” But whether this be the right interpretation of the allegory is much to be questioned. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-5 The Lord Jesus with his strong sword, the virtue of his death, and the preaching of his gospel, does and will destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, that old serpent. The world is a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, a place that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruits are gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction and persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of which are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulness of this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; if these be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. Though God sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to be reconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thorns instead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will tread them down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever since sin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitation given. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us take hold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by lively faith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy, believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a man that is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is in his reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. God is willing to be reconciled to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In that day - In that future time when the Jews would be captive in Babylon, and when they would sigh for deliverance (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>). This verse might have been connected with the previous chapter, as it refers to the same event, and then this chapter would have more appropriately commenced with the poem or song which begins in <a href="/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>.<p>With his sore - Hebrew, &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  haqa&#772;sha&#770;h - 'Hard.' Septuagint, &#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  Te&#772;n hagian - 'Holy.' The Hebrew means a sword that is hard, or well-tempered and trusty.<p>And great, and strong sword - The sword is an emblem of war, and is often used among the Hebrews to denote war (see <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). It is also an emblem of justice or punishment, as punishment then, as it is now in the Turkish dominions, was often inflicted by the sword <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41-42</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>. Here, if it refers to the overthrow of Babylon and its tyrannical king, it means that God would punish them by the armies of the Medes, employed as his sword or instrument. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>, David prays, 'Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword' (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>Leviathan - &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;  livya&#770;tha&#770;n. The Septuagint renders this, &#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  Te&#772;n drakonta - 'The dragon.' The word 'leviathan' is probably derived from &#1500;&#1493;&#1492;  la&#770;va&#770;h in Arabic, to weave, to twist (Gesenius); and literally means, "the twisted animal." The word occurs in six places in the Old Testament, and is translated in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, 'mourning,' Margin, 'leviathan;' in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>, 'leviathan' - in which chapter is an extended description of the animal; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a>, it is rendered 'leviathan,' and seems to be applied to Pharaoh; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a>, and in the passage before us, where it is twice also rendered 'leviathan.' Bochart (Hierez. ii. 5. 16-18) has gone into an extended argument to show that by the leviathan the crocodile is intended; and his argument is in my view conclusive. On this subject, Bochart, Dr. Good (on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>), and Robinson's Calmet, may be consulted.<p>The crocodile is a natural inhabitant of the Nile and of other Asiatic and African rivers; is of enormous voracity and strength, as well as of fleetness in swimming; attacks mankind and all animals with prodigious impetuosity; and is furnished with a coat of mail so scaly and callous that it will resist the force of a musket ball in every part except under the belly. It is, therefore, an appropriate image by which to represent a fierce and cruel tyrant. The sacred writers were accustomed to describe kings and tyrants by an allusion to strong and fierce animals. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>, the dragon, or the crocodile of the Nile, represents Pharaoh; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-2.htm">Ezekiel 22:2</a>, Pharaoh is compared to a young lion, and to a whale in the seas; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-14</a>, Pharaoh is compared to the dragon, and to the leviathan. In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, the four monarchs that should arise are likened to four great beasts. In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, Rome, the new Babylon, is compared to a great red dragon.<p>In the place before us, I suppose that the reference is to Babylon; or to the king and tyrant that ruled there, and that had oppressed the people of God. But among commentators there has been the greatest variety of explanation. As a "specimen" of the various senses which commentators often assign to passages of Scripture, we may notice the following views which have been taken of this passage. The Chaldee Paraphrast regards the leviathans, which are twice mentioned, as referring, the first one to some king like Pharaoh, and the second to a king like Sennacherib. rabbi Moses Haccohen supposes that the word denotes the most select or valiant of the rulers, princes, and commanders that were in the army of the enemy of the people of God. Jarchi supposes that by the first-mentioned leviathan is meant Egypt, by the second Assyria, and by the dragon which is in the sea, he thinks "Tyre" is intended.<p>Aben Ezra supposes that by the dragon in the sea, Egypt is denoted. Kimchi supposes that this will be fulfilled only in the times of the Messiah, and that the sea monsters mentioned here are Gog and Magog - and that these denote the armies of the Greeks, the Saracens, and the inhabitants of India. Abarbanel supposes that the Saracens, the Roman empire, and the other kingdoms of Gentiles, are intended by these sea monsters. Jerome, Sanctius, and some others suppose that "Satan" is denoted by the leviathan. Brentius supposes that this was fulfilled in the day of Pentecost when Satan was overcome by the preaching of the gospel. Other Christian interpreters have supposed, that by the leviathan first mentioned "Mahomet" is intended; by the second, "heretics;" and by the dragon in the sea, "Pagan India." Luther understood it of Assyria and Egypt; Calvin supposes that the description properly applies to the king of Egypt, but that under this image other enemies of the church are embraced, and does not doubt that "allegorically" Satan and his kingdom are intended. The more simple interpretation, however, is that which refers it to Babylon. This suits the connection: accords with the previous chapters; agrees with all that occurs in this chapter, and with the image which is used here. The crocodile, the dragon, the sea monster - extended, vast, unwieldy, voracious, and odious to the view - would be a most expressive image to denote the abhorrence with which the Jews would regard Babylon and its king.<p>The piercing serpent - The term 'serpent' (&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  na&#772;cha&#770;sh) may be given to a dragon, or an extended sea monster. Compare <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>. The term 'piercing,' is, in the Margin, 'Crossing like a bar.' The Septuagint renders it, &#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  Ophin pheugonta - 'Flying serpent. The Hebrew, &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;  ba&#772;riyach, rendered 'piercing,' is derived from &#1489;&#1512;&#1509;  ba&#770;rach," to flee;" and then to stretch across, or pass through, as a bar through boards <a href="/exodus/36-33.htm">Exodus 36:33</a>. Hence, this word may mean fleeing; extended; cross bar for fastening gates; or the cross piece for binding together the boards for the tabernacle of the congregation <a href="/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-31.htm">Exodus 36:31</a>. Lowth renders it, 'The rigid serpent;' probably with reference to the hard scales of the crocodile. The word "extended, huge, vast," will probably best suit the connection. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>, it is rendered, 'the crooked serpent;' referring to the constellation in the heavens by the name of the Serpent (see the note at that place). The idea of piercing is not in the Hebrew word, nor is it ever used in that sense.<p>That crooked serpent - This is correctly rendered; and refers to the fact that the monster here referred to throws itself into immense volumes or folds, a description that applies to all serpents of vast size. Virgil has given a similar description of sea monsters throwing themselves into vast convolutions:<p>'Ecce autem gemini a Tenedo tranquilla per alta<p> - immensis orbibus angues.'<p> - AEn. ii.203.<p>And again:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 27<p>Isa 27:1-13.

But here it is certain that the expression is metaphorical, and that by this <span class="ital">leviathan, serpent</span>, and <span class="ital">dragon</span> (for all signify the same thing) he understands some very powerful enemy or enemies (for the singular number may be here put for the plural, as it is in many other places) of God, and of his church or people, which may well be called by these names, partly for their great might, and partly for the great terror and destruction which they cause upon the earth, as the leviathan doth in the sea. He seems to have a special respect to some particular enemy and oppressor of God’s people; either the Assyrian emperor, who now was so; or rather the Babylonian, who should be so. Some understand this of the devil; but although it may be applied to him in a mystical sense, it seems to be literally meant of some potent and visible adversary; which seems more agreeable to the following verses, and to the usage of this and other prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The piercing serpent; </span> which by its sting pierceth quickly and deeply into men’s bodies.

The judgment on the ungodly powers of this world, is represented symbolically as the destruction of three living monsters by the sword of Jehovah. It is disputed whether the reference is to the world-power in general, or to a single Empire, or to three separate Empires. Assuming that they are distinct the “Dragon that is in the sea” is almost certainly an emblem of Egypt (ch. <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>). To the reference of the other two we have no key. It is of the essence of apocalyptic symbolism to be obscure; and it will always be possible, at any date, to find representatives, more or less suitable, of the three creatures. If the prophet wrote during or soon after the Exile they might denote Assyria and Babylonia; if at a later period, perhaps Babylonia and Persia, or even Persia and Greece.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the <span class="ital">sword</span> of Jehovah cf. ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/34-5.htm" title="For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down on Idumea, and on the people of my curse, to judgment....">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm" title="For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm" title="If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.">Deuteronomy 32:41</a> f.; <a href="/context/ezekiel/21-4.htm" title="Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:...">Ezekiel 21:4-5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm" title="Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus said the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:">Ezekiel 21:9</a> ff., &c.

How this astronomical dragon came to be specially connected with any political power we cannot tell; but we find an analogous case in the word Rahab as a symbol for Egypt (see on ch. <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm" title="For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.">Isaiah 30:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even leviathan that crooked serpent</span>] Render: <span class="bld">and Leviathan the tortuous serpent</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the dragon that</span> is <span class="ital">in the sea</span>] The sea means here the Nile, as often: see on <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - THE TRIPLE JUDGMENT ON THE POWERS OF DARKNESS. The crowning judgment of all is now briefly described. "In that day" - the day of God's vengeance - when all his other enemies have been put down, Jehovah shall finally visit with his sword three mighty foes, which are described under three figures - the first as "Leviathan, the swift serpent;" the second as "Leviathan, the crooked serpent; "and the third as "the dragon that is in the sea." It has been usual to see in these three monsters three kingdoms inimical to God - either Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt; or Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre; or Media, Persia, and Egypt. But this diversity of interpretation shows that there is no particular fitness in the emblems to symbolize any special kingdoms or world-powers, while the imagery itself and the law of climax alike point to something higher than world-powers being intended. "Leviathan," in <a href="/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, where the word first occurs, represents a supra-mundane power - probably "the dragon, the enemy of light, who in old Eastern traditions is conceived as ready to swallow up sun and moon, and plunge creation in original chaos or darkness" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 28); and the "dragon" is a customary emblem of Satan himself (<a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the prince of darkness. The triple vengeance here is parallel to the triple punishment, in the apocalyptic vision (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), of "the devil," "the beast," and "the false prophet," who have been termed by commentators "the three great enemies of God's kingdom" (see 'Speaker's Commentary on the New Testament,' vol. 4. p. 802). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord with his sore and great and strong sword</span>. The "sword" of Jehovah is first heard of in the Pentateuch, where it is called" glittering" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>). It is spoken of by David (<a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>), and frequently by Isaiah (see <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; 46:16). Mr. Cheyne supposes the idea to have been taken from the Baby-Ionian mythology, and seems to think it half material. But it is merely on a par with other anthrepomorphisms. The word rendered "sore" probably means "well-tempered," "keen." <span class="cmt_word">Leviathan</span>. Etymologically, the term "Leviathan" appears to mean "that which is coiled" or "twisted," whence it would seem to have been primarily applied, as in the present verse, to serpents. In <a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>, however, it manifestly designates the crocodile, while in <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> it must be used of some kind of cetacean. Thus its most appropriate English rendering would be "monster." <span class="cmt_word">The piercing serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the fleet</span>, or <span class="accented">fugitive serpent</span>. It is a general characteristic of the snake tribe to glide away and hide themselves when disturbed. <span class="cmt_word">Even leviathan that crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and also leviathan that crooked serpent</span>. It is quite clear that two distinct foes of God are pointed at - one characterized as "fleet," the other as "tortuous." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall slay the dragon.</span> Here is mention of a third enemy, probably Satan himself (see the introductory paragraph to this section). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The tephilla&#770;h now returns to the retrospective glance already cast in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> into that night of affliction, which preceded the redemption that had come. "Jehovah, in trouble they missed Thee, poured out light supplication when Thy chastisement came upon them. As a woman with child, who draws near to her delivery, writhes and cries out in her pangs, so were we in Thy sight, O Jehovah. We went with child, we writhed; it was as if we brought forth wind. We brought no deliverance to the land, and the inhabitants of the world did not come to the light." The substantive circumstantial clause in the parallel line, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, castigatione tua eos affilgente (&#1500; as in <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>), corresponds to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, a preterite &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; etire  equals  &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;, <a href="/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>, to be poured out and melt away) with Nun paragogic (which is only met with again in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-16.htm">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>, the yeko&#772;shu&#772;n in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a> being, according to the syntax, the future of ko&#772;sh), answers to pa&#770;kad, which is used here as in <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a>, in the sense of lustrando desiderare. Lachash is a quiet, whispering prayer (like the whispering of forms of incantation in <a href="/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>); sorrow renders speechless in the long run; and a consciousness of sin crushes so completely, that a man does not dare to address God aloud (<a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). Pregnancy and pangs are symbols of a state of expectation strained to the utmost, the object of which appears all the closer the more the pains increase. Often, says the perfected church, as it looks back upon its past history, often did we regard the coming of salvation as certain; but again and again were our hopes deceived. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;, "as a woman with child," etc. (see at <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>); the second is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "as it were, we brought forth wind." This is not an inverted expression, signifying we brought forth as it were wind; but &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; governs the whole sentence in the sense of "(it was) as if." The issue of all their painful toil was like the result of a false pregnancy (empneumatosis), a delivery of wind. This state of things also proceeded from Jehovah, as the expression "before Thee" implies. It was a consequence of the sins of Israel, and of a continued want of true susceptibility to the blessings of salvation. Side by side with their disappointed hope, <a href="/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a> places the ineffectual character of their won efforts. Israel's own doings - no, they could never make the land into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (i.e., bring it into a state of complete salvation); and (so might the final clause be understood) they waited in vain for the judgment of Jehovah upon the sinful world that was at enmity against them, or they made ineffectual efforts to overcome it. This explanation is favoured by the fact, that throughout the whole of this cycle of prophecies yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l does not mean the inhabitants of the holy land, but of the globe at large in the sense of "the world" (<a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5-6</a>). Again, the relation of &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; to the &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, land the figure previously employed of the pains of child-birth, speak most strongly in favour of the conclusion, that na&#770;phal is here used for the falling of the fruit of the womb (cf., Wis. 7:3, Il. xix. 110, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; and &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;). And yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l (the inhabitants of the world) fits in with this sense (viz., that the expected increase of the population never came), from the fact that in this instance the reference is not to the inhabitants of the earth; but the words signify inhabitants generally, or, as we should say, young, new-born "mortals." The punishment of the land under the weight of the empire still continued, and a new generation did not come to the light of day to populate the desolate land (cf., Psychol. p. 414). </body></html>
