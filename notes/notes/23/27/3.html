The world is a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, a place that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruits are gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction and persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of which are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulness of this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; if these be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. Though God sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to be reconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thorns instead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will tread them down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever since sin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitation given. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us take hold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by lively faith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy, believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a man that is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is in his reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. God is willing to be reconciled to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I the Lord do keep it - There is understood here or implied an introduction; as 'Yahweh said' (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-5</a>).<p>I will water it every moment - That is, constantly, as a vinedresser does his vineyard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. lest any hurt it&#8212;attack it [Maurer].

"Jehovah, in trouble they missed Thee, poured out light supplication when Thy chastisement came upon them. As a woman with child, who draws near to her delivery, writhes and cries out in her pangs, so were we in Thy sight, O Jehovah. We went with child, we writhed; it was as if we brought forth wind. We brought no deliverance to the land, and the inhabitants of the world did not come to the light." The substantive circumstantial clause in the parallel line, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, castigatione tua eos affilgente (&#1500; as in <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>), corresponds to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, a preterite &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; etire  equals  &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;, <a href="/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>, to be poured out and melt away) with Nun paragogic (which is only met with again in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-16.htm">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>, the yeko&#772;shu&#772;n in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a> being, according to the syntax, the future of ko&#772;sh), answers to pa&#770;kad, which is used here as in <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a>, in the sense of lustrando desiderare. Lachash is a quiet, whispering prayer (like the whispering of forms of incantation in <a href="/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>); sorrow renders speechless in the long run; and a consciousness of sin crushes so completely, that a man does not dare to address God aloud (<a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). Pregnancy and pangs are symbols of a state of expectation strained to the utmost, the object of which appears all the closer the more the pains increase. Often, says the perfected church, as it looks back upon its past history, often did we regard the coming of salvation as certain; but again and again were our hopes deceived. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;, "as a woman with child," etc. (see at <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>); the second is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "as it were, we brought forth wind." This is not an inverted expression, signifying we brought forth as it were wind; but &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; governs the whole sentence in the sense of "(it was) as if." The issue of all their painful toil was like the result of a false pregnancy (empneumatosis), a delivery of wind. This state of things also proceeded from Jehovah, as the expression "before Thee" implies. It was a consequence of the sins of Israel, and of a continued want of true susceptibility to the blessings of salvation. Side by side with their disappointed hope, <a href="/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a> places the ineffectual character of their won efforts. Israel's own doings - no, they could never make the land into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (i.e., bring it into a state of complete salvation); and (so might the final clause be understood) they waited in vain for the judgment of Jehovah upon the sinful world that was at enmity against them, or they made ineffectual efforts to overcome it. This explanation is favoured by the fact, that throughout the whole of this cycle of prophecies yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l does not mean the inhabitants of the holy land, but of the globe at large in the sense of "the world" (<a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5-6</a>). Again, the relation of &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; to the &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, land the figure previously employed of the pains of child-birth, speak most strongly in favour of the conclusion, that na&#770;phal is here used for the falling of the fruit of the womb (cf., Wis. 7:3, Il. xix. 110, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; and &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;). And yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l (the inhabitants of the world) fits in with this sense (viz., that the expected increase of the population never came), from the fact that in this instance the reference is not to the inhabitants of the earth; but the words signify inhabitants generally, or, as we should say, young, new-born "mortals." The punishment of the land under the weight of the empire still continued, and a new generation did not come to the light of day to populate the desolate land (cf., Psychol. p. 414). </body></html>
