The “defenced city” is that of the strangers, who are the enemies of God’s people, and its destruction is contrasted with the restoration of the purified Jerusalem of the preceding verse. To see in the “defenced city” which is to be laid low Jerusalem itself is at variance with the natural sequence of thought. The picture of desolation—calves feeding in what had been the busy streets of a populous city—is analogous to that of the “wild beasts of the desert,” roaring among the ruins of Babylon, in <a href="/context/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/27-10.htm" title="Yet the defended city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof....">Isaiah 27:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Yet, </span>&c. — Before this glorious promise, concerning the removal of Israel’s sin and calamity, shall be fulfilled, a dreadful and desolating judgment shall come upon them. <span class="ital">The defenced city shall be desolate </span>— Jerusalem, and the rest of the defenced cities of the land, the singular number being put for the plural; <span class="ital">and the habitation forsaken </span>— The most inhabited and populous parts of the country; or, as <span class="greekheb">נוה</span>properly signifies, their <span class="ital">pleasant habitation, </span>whether in the city or country; <span class="ital">left like a wilderness </span>— Which was the case in the time of the Babylonish captivity. <span class="ital">There shall the calf feed </span>— The calf is put for all sorts of cattle, which, it is foretold, should securely feed there, because there should be no man left to disturb or annoy them; <span class="ital">and consume the branches thereof </span>— Of their pleasant habitation; of the young trees that grow up in that desolated country. <span class="ital">When the boughs thereof are withered </span>— As they will be when they are thus gnawed and cropped by cattle; <span class="ital">they shall be broken off </span>— That there may be no hopes of their recovery. <span class="ital">The women come, </span>&c. —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He mentions women, because the men would be destroyed. <span class="ital">For it is a</span> <span class="ital">people of no understanding </span>— They neither know me, nor themselves; neither my word, nor my works: they know not the things which concern their peace, but blindly and wilfully go on in sin. <span class="ital">Therefore he that made them </span>— Both as they are creatures, and as they are his people; for this also is expressed by <span class="ital">making, </span>or <span class="ital">forming; will not have mercy on them </span>— So as to save them from this dreadful calamity and ruin, which they bring on themselves. Thus he overthrows their false and presumptuous conceit, that God would never destroy the work of his own hands, nor the seed of Abraham his friend.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:6-13 In the days of the gospel, the latter days, the gospel church shall be more firmly fixed than the Jewish church, and shall spread further. May our souls be continually watered and kept, that we may abound in the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. The Jews yet are kept a separate and a numerous people; they have not been rooted out as those who slew them. The condition of that nation, through so many ages, forms a certain proof of the Divine origin of the Scriptures; and the Jews live amongst us, a continued warning against sin. But though winds are ever so rough, ever so high, God can say to them, Peace, be still. And though God will afflict his people, yet he will make their afflictions to work for the good of their souls. According to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon, no people have shown such hatred to idols and idolatry as the Jews. And to all God's people, the design of affliction is to part between them and sin. The affliction has done us good, when we keep at a distance from the occasions of sin, and use care that we may not be tempted to it. Jerusalem had been defended by grace and the Divine protection; but when God withdrew, she was left like a wilderness. This has awfully come to pass. And this is a figure of the deplorable state of the vineyard, the church, when it brought forth wild grapes. Sinners flatter themselves they shall not be dealt with severely, because God is merciful, and is their Maker. We see how weak those pleas will be. Verses 12,13, seem to predict the restoration of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, and their recovery from their present dispersion. This is further applicable to the preaching of the gospel, by which sinners are gathered into the grace of God; the gospel proclaims the acceptable year of the Lord. Those gathered by the sounding of the gospel trumpet, are brought in to worship God, and added to the church; and the last trumpet will gather the saints together.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet the defensed city - Gesenius supposes that this means Jerusalem. So Calvin and Piscator understand it. Others understand it of Samaria, others of Babylon (as Vitringa, Rosenmuller, and Grotius), and others of cities in general, denoting those in Judea, or in other places. To me it seems plain that Babylon is referred to. The whole description seems to require this; and especially the fact that this song is supposed to be sung after the return from captivity to celebrate their deliverance. It is natural, therefore, that they should record the fact that the strong and mighty city where they had been so long in captivity, was now completely destroyed.

A familiar image of desolation (comp. <a href="/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy here passes for the fourth time into the tone of a song. The church recognises itself in the judgments upon the world, as Jehovah's well-protected and beloved vineyard. <p>In that day a merry vineyard - sing it! <p>I, Jehovah, its keeper, <p>Every moment I water it.<p>That nothing may come near it, <p>I watch it night and day.<p>Wrath have I none; <p>O, had I thorns, thistles before me! <p>I would make up to them in battle, <p>Burn them all together.<p>Men would then have to grasp at my protection, <p>Make peace with me, <p>Make peace with me. <p>Instead of introducing the song with, "In that day shall this song be sung," or some such introduction, the prophecy passes at once into the song. It consists in a descending scale of strophes, consisting of one of five lines (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>), one of four lines (<a href="/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>), and one of three lines (<a href="/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a>). The thema is placed at the beginning, in the absolute case: cerem chemer. This may signify a vineyard of fiery or good wine (compare cerem zaith in <a href="/judges/15-5.htm">Judges 15:5</a>); but it is possible that the reading should be cerem chemed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>, as the lxx, Targum, and most modern commentators assume.  &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500; signifies, according to <a href="/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-7.htm">Psalm 147:7</a> (cf., <a href="/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a>), to strike up a song with reference to anything - an onomatopoetic word (different from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to begin, literally to meet). Cerem (the vineyard) is a feminine here, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, the well, in the song of the well in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17-18</a>, and just as Israel, of which the vineyard here is a symbol (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>.), is sometimes regarded as masculine, and at other times as feminine (<a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>). Jehovah Himself is introduced as speaking. He is the keeper of the vineyard, who waters it every moment when there is any necessity (lirga&#770;&#8219;im, like labbeka&#770;rim in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>, every morning), and watches it by night as well as by day, that nothing may visit it. &#1506;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; (to visit upon) is used in other cases to signify the infliction of punishment; here it denotes visitation by some kind of misfortune. Because it was the church purified through afflictions, the feelings of Jehovah towards it were pure love, without any admixture of the burning of anger (che&#772;ma&#770;h). This is reserved for all who dare to do injury to this vineyard. Jehovah challenges these, and says, Who is there, then, that gives me thorns, thistles! &#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>, cf., <a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>.) The asyndeton, instead of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, which is customary elsewhere, corresponds to the excitement of the exalted defender. If He had thorns, thistles before Him, He would break forth upon them in war, i.e., make war upon them (ba&#770;h, neuter, upon such a mass of bush), and set it all on fire (&#1492;&#1510;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;). The arrangement of the strophes requires that we should connect &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; with &#1488;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1492; (var. &#1488;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1492;), though this is at variance with the accents. We may see very clearly, even by the choice of the expression bammilcha&#770;ma&#770;h, that thorns and thistles are a figurative representation of the enemies of the church (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6-7</a>). And in this sense the song concludes in <a href="/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a> : only by yielding themselves to mercy will they find mercy. &#1488;&#1493; with a voluntative following, "unless," as in <a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>. "Take hold of:" hechezik b', as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>, of Adonijah, who lays hold of the horns of the altar. "Make peace with:" &#8219;a&#770;sa&#770;h sha&#770;lo&#772;m l', as in <a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a>. The song closes here. What the church here utters, is the consciousness of the gracious protection of its God, as confirmed in her by the most recent events. </body></html>
