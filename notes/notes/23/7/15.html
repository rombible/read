The prophet reproved Ahaz and his court, for the little value they had for Divine revelation. Nothing is more grievous to God than distrust, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no effect; the Lord himself shall give a sign. How great soever your distress and danger, of you the Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing is in you. It shall be brought to pass in a glorious manner; and the strongest consolations in time of trouble are derived from Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, our expectations of him and from him. He would grow up like other children, by the use of the diet of those countries; but he would, unlike other children, uniformly refuse the evil and choose the good. And although his birth would be by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he should not be fed with angels' food. Then follows a sign of the speedy destruction of the princes, now a terror to Judah. Before this child, so it may be read; this child which I have now in my arms, (Shear-jashub, the prophet's own son, ver. 3,) shall be three or four years older, these enemies' forces shall be forsaken of both their kings. The prophecy is so solemn, the sign is so marked, as given by God himself after Ahaz rejected the offer, that it must have raised hopes far beyond what the present occasion suggested. And, if the prospect of the coming of the Divine Saviour was a never-failing support to the hopes of ancient believers, what cause have we to be thankful that the Word was made flesh! May we trust in and love Him, and copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Butter and honey - The word rendered "butter" (&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;  chem'a&#770;h), denotes not butter, but thick and curdled milk. This was the common mode of using milk as an article of food in the East, and is still. In no passage in the Old Testament does butter seem to be meant by the word. Jarchi says, that this circumstance denotes a state of plenty, meaning that the land should yield its usual increase notwithstanding the threatened invasion. Eustatius on this place says, that it denotes delicate food. The more probable interpretation is, that it was the usual food of children, and that it means that the child should be nourished in the customary manner. That this was the common nourishment of children, is abundantly proved by Bochart; "Hieroz." P. i. lib. xi. ch. li. p. 630. Barnabas, in his epistle says, 'The infant is first nourished with honey, and then with milk.' This was done usually by the prescription of physicians.<p>Paulus says, 'It is fit that the first food given to a child be honey, and then milk.' So Aetius, 'Give to a child, as its first food, honey;' see "Bochart." Some have, indeed, supposed that this refers to the fact that the Messiah should be "man" as well as God, and that his eating honey and butter was expressive of the fact that he had a "human nature!" But against this mode of interpretation, it is hoped, it is scarcely needful now to protest. It is suited to bring the Bible into contempt, and the whole science of exegesis into scorn. The Bible is a book of sense, and it should be interpreted on principles that commend themselves to the sober judgment of mankind. The word rendered "honey" - &#1491;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;  debash - is the same word - "dibs" - which is now used by the Arabs to denote the syrup or jelly which is made by boiling down wine. This is about the consistence of molasses, and is used as an article of food. Whether it was so employed in the time of Isaiah, cannot now be determined, but the word here may be used to denote honey; compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>.<p>That he may know - As this translation now stands, it is unintelligible. It would "seem" from this, that his eating butter and honey would "contribute" to his knowing good and evil. But this cannot be the meaning. It evidently denotes 'until he shall know,' or, 'at his knowing;' Nord. "Heb. Gram.," Section 1026. 3. He shall be no urished in the usual way, "until" he shall arrive at such a period of life as to know good from evil. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  Prine&#772; gno&#772;nai auton - 'before he knows.' The Chaldee, 'Until he shall know.'<p>To refuse the evil ... - Ignorance of good and evil denotes infancy. Thus, in Nineveh, it is said there were 'more than sixscore thousand perons that cannot discern between their right hand and left hand;' commonly supposed to denote infants; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; compare <a href="/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>. The meaning is, that he should be nourished in the usual mode in infancy, and before he should be able to discern right from wrong, the land should be forsaken of its kings. At what particular period of life this occurs, it may not be easy to determine. A capability to determine, in some degree, between good and evil, or between right and wrong, is usually manifest when the child is two or three years of age. It is evinced when there is a capability of understanding "law," and feeling that it is wrong to disobey it. This is certainly shown at a very early period of life; and it is not improper, therefore, to suppose that here a time was designated which was not more than two or three years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Horsley takes this as implying the real humanity of the Immanuel Jesus Christ, about to be fed as other infants (Lu 2:52).

The meaning is that the youth of Immanuel will be spent amidst the privations of a land laid waste by foreign invaders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he may know</span>] This is the rendering of the Vulgate and other ancient versions, and is maintained still by a few scholars. But the idea that eating butter and honey promotes the formation of ethical character is somewhat bizarre. Translate with R.V. <span class="bld">when he knoweth</span> (more precisely “towards the time when, &c.”). It must be admitted, however, that <span class="ital">exact</span> parallels to this use of the preposition cannot be produced (though cf. <a href="/genesis/24-63.htm" title="And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.">Genesis 24:63</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.">Exodus 14:27</a>). But what lapse of time is here indicated? The expression “refuse the evil and choose the good” must bear the same sense as in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm" title="For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.">Isaiah 7:16</a></span>, and from ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-4.htm" title="For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 8:4</a> we see that the event predicted in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm" title="For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.">Isaiah 7:16</a></span> was expected to happen in a very short time,—within two or three years from the date of the interview with Ahaz. It would seem, therefore, that the phrase denotes the age at which a child begins to exercise intelligent choice between the pleasant and the painful (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm" title="I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?">2 Samuel 19:35</a>). Most commentators, it is true, explain it of the development of moral consciousness, and think of a period of 10 or 12 years or even longer. But this introduces a needless discrepancy between this sign and that of <a href="/isaiah/8-4.htm" title="For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 8:4</a>. There is nothing improbable in the supposition that Isaiah expected the Assyrian invasion of Judah (which of course is presupposed by <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.">Isaiah 7:15</a></span>) to happen simultaneously with the destruction of Samaria and Damascus.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For head of Aram is Damascus, and head of Damascus Rezin, and in five-and-sixty years will Ephraim as a people be broken in pieces. And head of Ephraim is Samaria, and head of Samaria the son of Remalyahu; if ye believe not, surely ye will not remain." The attempt to remove <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>, as a gloss at variance with the context, which is supported by Eichhorn, Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, and others, is a very natural one; and in that case the train of thought would simply be, that the two hostile kingdoms would continue in their former relation without the annexation of Judah. But when we look more closely, it is evident that the removal of <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> destroys both the internal connection and the external harmony of the clauses. For just as <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> correspond, so do <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>. Ephraim, i.e., the kingdom of the ten tribes, which has entered into so unnatural and ungodly a covenant with idolatrous Syria, will cease to exist as a nation in the course of sixty-five years; "and ye, if ye do not believe, but make flesh your arm, will also cease to exist." Thus the two clauses answer to one another: <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is a prophecy announcing Ephraim's destruction, and <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a> a warning, threatening Judah with destruction, if it rejects the promise with unbelief. Moreover, the style of <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is quite in accordance with that of Isaiah (on &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, see <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; and on &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, "away from being a people," in the sense of "so that it shall be no longer a nation," <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>). And the doctrinal objection, that the prophecy is too minute, and therefore taken ex eventu, has no force whatever, since the Old Testament prophecy furnishes an abundance of examples of the same kind (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a>., <a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>., etc.). The only objection that can well be raised is, that the time given in <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is wrong, and is not in harmony with <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>. Now, undoubtedly the sixty-five years do not come out if we suppose the prophecy to refer to what was done by Tiglath-pileser after the Syro-Ephraimitish war, and to what was also done to Ephraim by Shalmanassar in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, to which <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a> unquestionably refers, and more especially to the former. But there is another event still, through which the existence of Ephraim, not only as a kingdom, but also as a people, was broken up - namely, the carrying away of the last remnant of the Ephraimitish population, and the planting of colonies from Eastern Asia by Esarhaddon.<p>(Note: The meaning of this king's name is Assur fratrem dedit (Asur&#775;ach&#775;yiddin): vid., Oppert, Expedition, t. ii. p. 354.)<p>on Ephraimitish soil (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>). Whereas the land of Judah was left desolate after the Chaldean deportation, and a new generation grew up there, and those who were in captivity were once more enabled to return; the land of Ephraim was occupied by heathen settlers, and the few who were left behind were melted up with these into the mixed people of the Samaritans, and those in captivity were lost among the heathen. We have only to assume that what was done to Ephraim by Esarhaddon, as related in the historical books, took place in the twenty-second and twenty-third years of Manasseh (the sixth year of Esarhaddon), which is very probable, since it must have been under Esarhaddon that Manasseh was carried away to Babylon about the middle of his reign (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); and we get exactly sixty-five years from the second year of the reign of Ahaz to the termination of Ephraim's existence as a nation (viz., Ahaz, 14; Hezekiah, 29; Manasseh, 22; in all, 65). It was then that the unconditional prediction, "Ephraim as a people will be broken in pieces," was fulfilled (ye&#772;chath me&#772;&#8219;a&#770;m; it is certainly not the 3rd pers. fut. kal, but the niphal, <a href="/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a>), just as the conditional threat "ye shall not remain" was fulfilled upon Judah in the Babylonian captivity. &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503; signifies to have a fast hold, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; to prove fast-holding. If Judah did not hold fast to its God, it would lose its fast hold by losing its country, the ground beneath its feet. We have the same play upon words in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>. The suggestion of Geiger is a very improbable one, viz., that the original reading was &#1489;&#1497; &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501;, but that &#1489;&#1497; appeared objectionable, and was altered into &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. Why should it be objectionable, when the words form the conclusion to a direct address of Jehovah Himself, which is introduced with all solemnity? For this &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, passing over from a confirmative into an affirmative sense, and employed, as it is here, to introduce the apodosis of the hypothetical clause, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>, and (in the formula &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm">Numbers 22:29</a>, <a href="/numbers/22-33.htm">Numbers 22:33</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a> : their continued existence would depend upon their faith, as this chi emphatically declares. </body></html>
