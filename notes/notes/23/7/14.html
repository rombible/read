and those who are resolved that they will not trust God, yet pretend they will not tempt him. The prophet reproved Ahaz and his court, for the little value they had for Divine revelation. Nothing is more grievous to God than distrust, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no effect; the Lord himself shall give a sign. How great soever your distress and danger, of you the Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing is in you. It shall be brought to pass in a glorious manner; and the strongest consolations in time of trouble are derived from Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, our expectations of him and from him. He would grow up like other children, by the use of the diet of those countries; but he would, unlike other children, uniformly refuse the evil and choose the good. And although his birth would be by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he should not be fed with angels' food. Then follows a sign of the speedy destruction of the princes, now a terror to Judah. Before this child, so it may be read; this child which I have now in my arms, (Shear-jashub, the prophet's own son, ver. 3,) shall be three or four years older, these enemies' forces shall be forsaken of both their kings. The prophecy is so solemn, the sign is so marked, as given by God himself after Ahaz rejected the offer, that it must have raised hopes far beyond what the present occasion suggested. And, if the prospect of the coming of the Divine Saviour was a never-failing support to the hopes of ancient believers, what cause have we to be thankful that the Word was made flesh! May we trust in and love Him, and copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - Since you will not "ask" a pledge that the land shall be safe, Yahweh will furnish one unasked. A sign or proof is desirable in the case, and Yahweh will not withhold it because a proud and contemptuous monarch refuses to seek it. Perhaps there is no prophecy in the Old Testament on which more has been written, and which has produced more perplexity among commentators than this. And after all, it still remains, in many respects, very obscure. Its general original meaning is not difficult. It is, that in a short time - within the time when a young woman, then a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a child, and that child should grow old enough to distinguish between good and evils - the calamity which Ahaz feared would be entirely removed. The confederacy would be broken up, and the land forsaken by both those kings. The conception and birth of a child - which could be known only by him who knows "all" future events - would be the evidence of such a result. His appropriate "name" would be such as would be a "sign," or an indication that God was the protector of the nation, or was still with them. In the examination of this difficult prophecy, my first object will be to give an explanation of the meaning of the "words and phrases" as they occur in the passage, and then to show, as far as I may be able, what was the design of the passage.<p>The Lord himself - Hebrew, 'Adonai;' see this word explained in the the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>. He will do it without being asked to do it; he will do it though it is rejected and despised; he will do it because it is important for the welfare of the nation, and for the confirmation of his religion, to furnish a demonstration to the people that he is the only true God. It is clearly implied here, that the sign should be such as Yahweh alone could give. It would be such as would be a demonstration that he presided over the interests of the people. If this refers to the birth of a child, then it means that this was an event which could be known only to God, and which could be accomplished only by his agency. If it refers to the miraculous conception and birth of the Messiah, then it means that that was an event which none but God could accomplish. The true meaning I shall endeavor to state in the notes, at the close of <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>.<p>Shall give you - Primarily to the house of David; the king and royal family of Judah. It was especially designed to assure the government that the kingdom would be safe. Doubtless, however, the word 'you' is designed to include the nation, or the people of the kingdom of Judah. It would be so public a sign, and so clear a demonstration, as to convince them that their city and land must be ultimately safe.<p>A sign - A pledge; a token; an evidence of the fulfillment of what is predicted. The word does not, of necessity, denote a miracle, though it is often so applied; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>. Here it means a proof, a demonstration, a certain indication that what he had said should be fulfilled. As that was to be such a demonstration as to show that he was "able" to deliver the land, the word "here" denotes that which was miraculous, or which could be effected "only" by Yahweh.<p>Behold - &#1492;&#1504;&#1492;  hinne&#770;h. This interjection is a very common one in the Old Testament. It is used to arrest attention; to indicate the importance of what was about to be said. It serves to designate persons and things; places and actions. It is used in lively descriptions, and animated discourse; when anything unusual was said, or occurred; or any thing which especially demanded attention; <a href="/genesis/12-19.htm">Genesis 12:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-16.htm">Genesis 16:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>. It means here, that an event was to occur which demanded the attention of the unbelieving monarch, and the regard of the people - an event which would be a full demonstration of what the prophet had said, that God would protect and save the nation.<p>A virgin - This word properly means a girl, maiden, virgin, a young woman who is unmarried, and who is of marriageable age. The word &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;  &#8219;alma&#770;h, is derived from the verb &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#770;lam, "to conceal, to hide, to cover." The word &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;  &#8219;elem, from the same verb, is applied to a "young man," in <a href="/1_samuel/17-56.htm">1 Samuel 17:56</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-22.htm">1 Samuel 20:22</a>. The word here translated a virgin, is applied to Rebekah <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-43.htm">Genesis 24:43</a>, and to Miriam, the sister of Moses, <a href="/exodus/2-8.htm">Exodus 2:8</a>. It occurs in only seven places in the Old Testament. Besides those already mentioned, it is found in <a href="/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>; Sol 1:3; Sol 6:8; and <a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm">Proverbs 30:19</a>. In all these places, except, perhaps, in Proverbs, it is used in its obvious natural sense, to denote a young, unmarried female. In the Syriac, the word  ale&#774;m, means to grow up, juvenis factus est; juvenescere fecited. Hence, the derivatives are applied to youth; to young men; to young women - to those who "are growing up," and becoming youths.<p>The etymology of the word requires us to suppose that it means one who is growing up to a marriageable state, or to the age of puberty. The word maiden, or virgin, expresses the correct idea. Hengstenberg contends, that it means one "in the unmarried state;" Gesenius, that it means simply the being of marriageable age, the age of puberty. The Hebrews usually employed the word &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  bethu&#770;la&#770;h, to denote a pure virgin (a word which the Syriac translation uses here); but the word here evidently denotes one who was "then" unmarried; and though its primary idea is that of one who is growing up, or in a marriageable state, yet the whole connection requires us to understand it of one who was "not then married," and who was, therefore, regarded and designated as a virgin. The Vulgate renders it 'virgo.' The Septuagint, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  he&#772; parthenos, "a virgin" - a word which they use as a translation of the Hebrew &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  bethu&#770;la&#770;h in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16-17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-3.htm">Leviticus 21:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-19.htm">Deuteronomy 22:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>; <a href="/judges/19-24.htm">Judges 19:24</a>; <a href="/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>; and in thirty-three other places (see Trommius' Concordance); of &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;  na&#8219;a&#774;ra&#770;h, a girl, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a>, <a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a> (twice); <a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm">1 Kings 1:2</a>; and of &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;  &#8219;alma&#770;h, only in <a href="/genesis/24-43.htm">Genesis 24:43</a>; and in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.<p>The word, in the view of the Septuagint translators, therefore conveyed the proper idea of a virgin. The Chaldee uses substantially the same word as the Hebrew. The idea of a "virgin" is, therefore, the most obvious and natural idea in the use of this word. It does not, however, imply that the person spoken of should be a virgin "when the child" should be born; or that she should ever after be a virgin. It means simply that one who was "then" a virgin, but who was of marriageable age, should conceive, and bear a son. Whether she was "to be" a virgin "at the time" when the child was born, or was to remain such afterward, are inquiries which cannot be determined by a philological examination of the word. It is evident also, that the word is not opposed to "either" of these ideas. "Why" the name which is thus given to an unmarried woman was derived from the verb to "hide, to conceal," is not agreed among lexicographers. The more probable opinion is, that it was because to the time of marriage, the daughter was supposed to be hidden or concealed in the family of the parents; she was kept shut up, as it were, in the paternal dwelling. This idea is given by Jerome, who says, 'the name is given to a virgin because she is said to be hidden or secret; because she does not expose herself to the gaze of men, but is kept with great care under the custody of parents.' The sum of the inquiry here, into the meaning of the word translated "virgin," is, that it does not differ from that word as used by us. The expression means no more than that one who was then a virgin should have a son, and that this should be a sign to Ahaz.<p>And shall call his name - It was usual for "mothers" to give names to their children; <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>; <a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-18.htm">Genesis 30:18</a>. There is, therefore, no reason to suppose, as many of the older interpreters did, that the fact that it is said the mother should give the name, was a proof that the child should have no human father. Such arguments are unworthy of notice; and only show to what means people have resorted in defending the doctrines, and in interpreting the pages of the Bible. The phrase, 'she will name,' is, moreover, the same as 'they shall name,' or he shall be named. 'We are not, then, to suppose that the child should actually receive the name Immanuel as a proper name, since, according to the usage of the prophet, and especially of Isaiah, that is often ascribed to a person or thing as a name which belongs to him in an eminent degree as an attribute; see <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>.' - "Hengstenberg." The idea is, that that would be a name that might be "appropriately" given to the child. Another name was also given to this child, expressing substantially the same thing, with a circumstantial difference; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>.<p>Immanuel - Hebrew 'God with us' - &#1506;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;  &#8219;imma&#770;nu&#770;'e&#770;l - from &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#774;l, "God," and &#1506;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;  &#8219;&#305;&#770;mma&#770;nu&#770;, "with us." The name is designed to denote that God would be with the nation as its protector, and the birth of this child would be a sign or pledge of it. The mere circumstance that this name is given, however, does not imply anything in regard to the nature or rank of the child, for nothing was more common among the Jews than to incorporate the name, or a part of the name, of the Deity with the names which they gave to their children. Thus, "Isaiah" denotes the salvation of Yahweh; "Jeremiah," the exaltation or grandeur of Yahweh, each compounded of two words, in which the name Yahweh constitutes a part. Thus, also in "Elijah," the two names of God are combined, and it means literally, "God the Yahweh." Thus, also "Eliab," God my faather; "Eliada," knowledge of God; "Eliakim," the resurrection of God; "Elihu," he is my God; "Elisha," salvation of God. In none of these instances is the fact, that the name of God is incorporated with the proper name of the individual, any argument in respect to his rank or character.<p>It is true, that Matthew Mat 1:23 uses this name as properly expressing the rank of the Messiah; but all that can be demonstrated from the use of the name by Matthew is, that it properly designated the nature and rank of the Lord Jesus. It was a pledge, then, that God was with his people, and the name designated by the prophet had a complete fulfillment in its use as applied to the Messiah. Whether the Messiah be regarded as himself a pledge and demonstration of the presence and protection of God, or whether the name be regarded as descriptive of his nature and dignity, yet there was an "appropriateness" in applying it to him. It was fully expressive of the event of the incarnation. Jerome supposes that the name, Immanuel, denotes nothing more than divine aid and protection. Others have supposed, however, that the name must denote the assumption of our nature by God in the person of the Messiah, that is, that God became man. So Theodoret, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Lactantius, Chrysostom. Calvin, Rosenmuller, and others. The true interpretation is, that no argument to prove that can be derived from the use of the name; but when the fact of the incarnation has been demonstrated from other sources, the "name is appropriately expressive of that event." So it seems to be used by Matthew.<p>It may be quite true, that no argument can be founded on the bare name, Immanuel; yet that name, "in its connection here," may certainly be regarded as a designed prediction of the incarnation of Christ. Such a design our author allows in the prophecy generally. 'The prophet,' says he, 'designedly made use of language which would be appropriate to a future and most glorious event.' Why, then, does he speak of the most pregnant word in the prophecy as if Matthew had accidentally stumbled on it, and, finding it would appropriately express the nature of Christ, accomodated it for that purpose? Having originally rejected the Messianic reference, and been convinced only by a more careful examination of the passage, that he was in error, something of his old view seems still to cling to this otherwise admirable exposition. 'The name Immanuel,' says Professor Alexander, 'although it might be used to signify God's providential presence merely <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a>, 12; <a href="/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, has a latitude and pregnancy of meaning which can scarcely be fortuitous; and which, combined with all the rest, makes the conclusion almost unavoidable, that it was here intended to express a personal, as well as a providential presence ... When we read in the Gospel of Matthew, that Jesus Christ was actually born of a virgin, and that all the circumstances of his birth came to pass that this very prophecy might be fulfilled, it has less the appearance of an unexpected application, than of a conclusion rendered necessary by a series of antecedent facts and reasonings, the last link in a long chain of intimations more or less explicit (referring to such prophecies as <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>The same considerations seem to show that the prophecy is not merely accommodated, which is, moreover, clear fram the emphatic form of the citation &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;  touto holon gegonen hina ple&#772;roothe&#772;, making it impossible to prove the existence of any quotation in the proper sense, if this be not one.' But, indeed, the author himself admits all this, though his language is less decided and consistent than could be wished on so important a subject. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. himself&#8212;since thou wilt not ask a sign, nay, rejectest the offer of one.<p>you&#8212;for the sake of the house of believing "David" (God remembering His everlasting covenant with David), not for unbelieving Ahaz' sake.<p>Behold&#8212;arresting attention to the extraordinary prophecy.<p>virgin&#8212;from a root, "to lie hid," virgins being closely kept from men's gaze in their parents' custody in the East. The Hebrew, and the Septuagint here, and Greek (Mt 1:23), have the article, the virgin, some definite one known to the speaker and his hearers; primarily, the woman, then a virgin, about immediately to become the second wife, and bear a child, whose attainment of the age of discrimination (about three years) should be preceded by the deliverance of Judah from its two invaders; its fullest significancy is realized in "the woman" (Ge 3:15), whose seed should bruise the serpent's head and deliver captive man (Jer 31:22; Mic 5:3). Language is selected such as, while partially applicable to the immediate event, receives its fullest, most appropriate, and exhaustive accomplishment in Messianic events. The New Testament application of such prophecies is not a strained "accommodation"; rather the temporary fulfilment of an adaptation of the far-reaching prophecy to the present passing event, which foreshadows typically the great central end of prophecy, Jesus Christ (Re 19:10). Evidently the wording is such as to apply more fully to Jesus Christ than to the prophet's son; "virgin" applies, in its simplest sense, to the Virgin Mary, rather than to the prophetess who ceased to be a virgin when she "conceived"; "Immanuel," God with us (Joh 1:14; Re 21:3), cannot in a strict sense apply to Isaiah's son, but only to Him who is presently called expressly (Isa 9:6), "the Child, the Son, Wonderful (compare Isa 8:18), the mighty God." Local and temporary features (as in Isa 7:15, 16) are added in every type; otherwise it would be no type, but the thing itself. There are resemblances to the great Antitype sufficient to be recognized by those who seek them; dissimilarities enough to confound those who do not desire to discover them.<p>call&#8212;that is, "she shall," or as Margin, "thou, O Virgin, shalt call;" mothers often named their children (Ge 4:1, 25; 19:37; 29:32). In Mt 1:23 the expression is strikingly changed into, "They shall call"; when the prophecy received its full accomplishment, no longer is the name Immanuel restricted to the prophetess' view of His character, as in its partial fulfilment in her son; all shall then call (that is, not literally), or regard Him as peculiarly and most fitly characterized by the descriptive name, "Immanuel" (1Ti 3:16; Col 2:9).<p>name&#8212;not mere appellation, which neither Isaiah's son nor Jesus Christ bore literally; but what describes His manifested attributes; His character (so Isa 9:6). The name in its proper destination was not arbitrary, but characteristic of the individual; sin destroyed the faculty of perceiving the internal being; hence the severance now between the name and the character; in the case of Jesus Christ and many in Scripture, the Holy Ghost has supplied this want [Olshausen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore; </span> because you despise me, and the sign which I now offer to you, God of his own free grace will send you a more honourable messenger, and give you a nobler sign, to try whether that will cure you of your infidelity.

Because this was a clear demonstration of God’s infinite power, and goodness, and faithfulness, and consequently of the certain truth of all God’s promises from time to time, which can never fill so long as those attributes of God stand; and men’s faith is either strong or weak, as they believe them or doubt of them; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/77-8.htm" title="Is his mercy clean gone for ever? does his promise fail for ever more?">Psalm 77:8</a> 78:19,20 Ro 4:20,21</span>. And so this was a proper remedy for Ahaz’s disease, which was a secret suspicion that God either could not or would not deliver them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because that promise, I say not only the actual giving, which was long after, but even the promise, of the Messiah, which had been made long since, and oft renewed, and was universally believed by all the people, was the foundation of all God’s mercies and promises unto them, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2 Corinthians 1:20</a></span>, and a pledge of the accomplishment of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

Whether they would ask one or not; a sign both in heaven and earth, namely, the promised Messiah; who being the Lord from heaven, would take flesh of a virgin on earth; and who as man, being buried in the heart of the earth, would be raised from thence, and ascend up into heaven; and whose birth, though it was to be many years after, was a sign of present deliverance to Judah from the confederacy of the two kings of Syria and Israel; and of future safety, since it was not possible that this kingdom should cease to be one until the Messiah was come, who was to spring from Judah, and be of the house of David; wherefore by how much the longer off was his birth, by so much the longer was their safety. <p>Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; this is not to be understood of Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, by his wife, as some Jewish writers interpret it; which interpretation Jarchi refutes, by observing that Hezekiah was nine years old when his father began to reign, and this being, as he says, the fourth year of his reign, he must be at this time thirteen years of age; in like manner, Aben Ezra and Kimchi object to it; and besides, his mother could not be called a "virgin": and for the same reason it cannot be understood of any other son of his either by his wife, as Kimchi thinks, or by some young woman; moreover, no other son of his was ever lord of Judea, as this Immanuel is represented to be, in <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> nor can it be interpreted of Isaiah's wife and son, as Aben Ezra and Jarchi think; since the prophet could never call her a "virgin", who had bore him children, one of which was now with him; nor indeed a "young woman", but rather "the prophetess", as in <a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a> nor was any son of his king of Judah, as this appears to be, in the place before cited: but the Messiah is here meant, who was to be born of a pure virgin; as the word here used signifies in all places where it is mentioned, as <a href="/genesis/24-43.htm">Genesis 24:43</a> and even in <a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm">Proverbs 30:19</a> which is the instance the Jews give of the word being used of a woman corrupted; since it does not appear that the maid and the adulterous woman are one and the same person; and if they were, she might, though vitiated, be called a maid or virgin, from her own profession of herself, or as she appeared to others who knew her not, or as she was antecedent to her defilement; which is no unusual thing in Scripture, see <a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a> to which may be added, that not only the Evangelist Matthew renders the word by  "a virgin"; but the Septuagint interpreters, who were Jews, so rendered the word hundreds of years before him; and best agrees with the Hebrew word, which comes from the root  which signifies to "hide" or "cover"; virgins being covered and unknown to men; and in the eastern country were usually kept recluse, and were shut up from the public company and conversation of men: and now this was the sign that was to be given, and a miraculous one it was, that the Messiah should be born of a pure and incorrupt virgin; and therefore a "behold" is prefixed to it, as a note of admiration; and what else could be this sign or wonder? not surely that a young married woman, either Ahaz's or Isaiah's wife, should be with child, which is nothing surprising, and of which there are repeated instances every day; nor was it that the young woman was unfit for conception at the time of the prophecy, which was the fancy of some, as Jarchi reports, since no such intimation is given either in the text or context; nor did it lie in this, that it was a male child, and not a female, which was predicted, as R. Saadiah Gaon, in Aben Ezra, would have it; for the sign or wonder does not lie in the truth of the prophet's prediction, but in the greatness of the thing predicted; besides, the verification of this would not have given the prophet much credit, nor Ahaz and the house of David much comfort, since this might have been ascribed rather to a happy conjecture than to a spirit of prophecy; much less can the wonder be, that this child should eat butter and honey, as soon as it was born, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi suggest; since nothing is more natural to, and common with young children, than to take down any kind of liquids which are sweet and pleasant. <p>And shall call his name Immanuel; which is, by interpretation, "God with us", <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a> whence it appears that the Messiah is truly God, as well as truly man: the name is expressive of the union of the two natures, human and divine, in him; of his office as Mediator, who, being both God and man, is a middle person between both; of his converse with men on earth, and of his spiritual presence with his people.

The Hebrew word (<span class="ital">‘almâh</span>) means strictly “a young woman of marriageable age.” Both etymology and usage (cf. esp. <a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm" title="The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.">Proverbs 30:19</a>; <a href="/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>) are adverse to the opinion, once prevalent among Christian interpreters and maintained by a few in recent times, that virginity is necessarily connoted (see Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Prophets</span>, Revd. Ed. pp. 426 f.). To express that idea a different word (<span class="ital">běthûlâh</span>) must have been employed, although even it might not be wholly free from ambiguity (? <a href="/joel/1-8.htm" title="Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.">Joel 1:8</a>). It is, of course, not disputed that <span class="ital">‘almâh may</span> be used of a virgin (as <a href="/genesis/24-43.htm" title="Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;">Genesis 24:43</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-8.htm" title="And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.">Exodus 2:8</a>); but even if this usage were more uniform than it is, it would still be far from proving that virginity was an essential of the notion. It would appear, therefore, that the idea of a miraculous conception was not present to Isaiah’s mind at this time, since a prediction of such astounding import must surely have been clothed in unambiguous language. Nor does the def. art., which is used in the original, necessarily denote a particular individual. (Cf. <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2 Samuel 17:17</a>, and see Davidson, <span class="ital">Synt.</span> § 21 <span class="ital">e.</span>) So far as grammar and context go, the expression may mean any young woman, fit to become a mother, whether as yet married or unmarried.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall conceive, and bear a son</span>] The same phrase in <a href="/genesis/16-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, you are with child and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael; because the LORD has heard your affliction.">Genesis 16:11</a>; <a href="/judges/13-5.htm" title="For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.">Jdg 13:5</a>. In the passage before us the verbs in the original are both participles, and might refer either to the present or the future. But it is doubtful if we can fairly apply one to the present and the other to the future, translating “<span class="ital">is</span> with child and <span class="ital">shall</span> bear.” Since the birth is certainly future, it seems natural to take the first verb in a future sense also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall call</span>] An archaic form, easily mistaken for 2nd pers. (so LXX. &c.). The mother names the child, as in <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/4-25.htm" title="And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-37.htm" title="And the first born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.">Genesis 19:37</a> f.; <a href="/genesis/29-32.htm" title="And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.">Genesis 29:32</a>, &c. An instructive parallel is the naming of the child Ichabod, born to Eli’s daughter-in-law on the dark day when the ark of God was taken and the glory departed from Israel (<a href="/context/1_samuel/4-19.htm" title="And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came on her....">1 Samuel 4:19-22</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Immanuel</span>] “With us is God.” The battle-cry of Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years War, “Gott mit uns,” was also Isaiah’s watchword for the coming crisis (cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm" title="And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.">Isaiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm" title="Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.">Isaiah 8:10</a>); and like other great thoughts of his ministry he as it were gives it personal and concrete actuality by conceiving it as embodied in the name of a child.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Additional Note on Chap. <a href="/context/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel....">Isaiah 7:14-16</a>Probably no single passage of the Old Testament has been so variously interpreted or has given rise to so much controversy as the prophecy contained in these verses. The difficulties arise mainly from the fact that while the terms of the prediction are so indefinite as to admit a wide range of possibilities, we have no record of its actual fulfilment in any contemporary event. The purpose of this note will be to indicate the chief lines along which a solution has been sought for, and to consider how far they satisfy the conditions of a reasonable historical exegesis. But before entering on this survey, it will be well to enquire what sort of fulfilment the context would lead us to expect, or in other words what kind of sign would serve the immediate objects of the prophet’s mission to Ahaz.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We are not entitled to assume as a matter of course that the sign here given will be in all respects such a sign as Ahaz might have asked at an earlier stage of the interview (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm" title="Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.">Isaiah 7:11</a></span>). In the first place it need not involve an objective miracle, although a miracle of the most stupendous order was originally put within the option of Ahaz. Any of the senses in which the word “sign” is used (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm" title="Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.">Isaiah 7:11</a></span>) in connexion with a prediction, would satisfy the requirements of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a></span>. But further there is a presumption that the <span class="ital">import</span> of the sign will have been changed by what has taken place in the interval. Isaiah’s first message to Ahaz is an unqualified assurance of deliverance from the designs of Rezin and Pekah, and the sign first offered would be a sign of that and that alone. The prospect of an Assyrian invasion was no doubt in the background of the prophet’s horizon, but his message to Ahaz is complete in itself and takes no account of that final catastrophe. It is manifest, however, that in Isaiah’s mind the whole aspect of affairs is altered by the king’s refusal. The Assyrian invasion is brought into immediate connexion with the attack of the allies, and a new forecast of the future is presented by the prophet in which three great events follow closely on one another: (1) the collapse of the project of the allied princes, (2) the total destruction of Syria and Ephraim by the Assyrians, and (3) the devastation of Judah by the same ruthless conquerors. And the most natural supposition is that the new sign will be an epitome of this new and darker outlook, that is to say it will be a pledge at once of the immediate deliverance and of the judgment that lies behind it. Indeed this view is so obviously implied by <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel....">Isaiah 7:14-16</a></span> that we are shut up to it unless, with some critics, we remove <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.">Isaiah 7:15</a></span> as an interpolation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now there are three features of the prediction in which the import of the sign may be looked for: (i) the birth of the child, (ii) his name, and (iii) his history. And of these three the last is certainly an essential element of the prophecy, as is shewn by <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good....">Isaiah 7:15-16</a></span>. With regard to the other two we can only say that it is antecedently improbable that either of them should be without some special significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) If the import of the sign be sought mainly in the <span class="ital">birth</span> of the child it becomes almost necessary to assume that the terms of the prophecy point to something extraordinary and mysterious in the circumstances of the birth. This is the case with the traditional Christian interpretation, which finds in it a direct prediction of the miraculous conception of the Virgin Mother of our Lord. The chief support of this view has always been the authority of the Evangelist Matthew, who cites <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a></span> in relating the birth of Jesus (<a href="/context/isaiah/1-22.htm" title="Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:...">Isaiah 1:22-23</a>). But it must be observed that such a citation is not decisive as to the <span class="ital">original</span> sense of the passage, any more than <a href="/matthew/2-15.htm" title="And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.">Matthew 2:15</a> determines the original sense of <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>. The great difficulty of the interpretation is that such an event could by no means serve the purpose of a sign to Ahaz. It may be freely admitted, in view of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm" title="Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.">Isaiah 7:11</a></span>, that the expectation of a parthenogenesis is not too bold to be attributed to Isaiah in this moment of ecstatic inspiration. But if this be granted on the one hand it must be conceded on the other that he expected the miracle to be wrought in the immediate future; his language (“a virgin is about to conceive”) implies that the prediction is on the eve of fulfilment, and the assurance in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm" title="For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.">Isaiah 7:16</a></span> is nugatory if the promised sign was not to happen for more than 700 years. Moreover, such an idea would require to be unambiguously expressed, and we have seen that the word <span class="ital">‘almâh</span> does not connote virginity in the strict sense. Whatever element of truth, therefore, may underlie this exegesis, it can scarcely be held to afford an adequate solution of the problem presented by the oracle in its primary and historical application.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) Another class of explanations regards the event as a sign to Ahaz and nothing more, and of these we may examine first those which find the chief significance of the sign in the <span class="ital">naming</span> of the child. Perhaps the most persuasive presentation of this view is that given by Duhm. According to that expositor, the <span class="ital">‘almâh</span> is any young mother who may give birth to a child in the hour of Judah’s deliverance from Syria and Ephraim. “God (is) with us” will be the spontaneous exclamation of child-bearing women in that time; and to such utterances at the moment of birth a certain oracular significance was attached, which caused them to be perpetuated in the name of the child. The child (or children) bearing the name Immanuel will grow up as a sign to Ahaz, first of the genuineness of Isaiah’s inspiration, who foretold the event, and second of the yet future judgment threatened on the same occasion and his own rejection by Jehovah. To this theory no exception can be taken on grammatical or historical grounds. It is undoubtedly rendered easier by the excision of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.">Isaiah 7:15</a></span>, which Duhm advocates. If that verse be retained one feels that the sign is rather overloaded by a circumstance which is directly opposed to the meaning of the name. And apart from this there will perhaps remain an impression that justice has not been done to the emphasis with which the birth is announced. Why, on this view, should the mother be an <span class="ital">‘almâh</span>—a <span class="ital">young</span> woman?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iii) A third view (not to be sharply distinguished from ii) lays stress not so much on the birth or the naming as on the <span class="ital">history</span> of the child, which becomes a sort of chronological thread on which political events are strung. The meaning is: before the birth of a certain child Judah will have experienced a great deliverance (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a></span>), before he has emerged from infancy, Syria and Ephraim will have disappeared (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm" title="For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.">Isaiah 7:16</a></span>) and at a later stage of his development the land of Judah will be reduced to a pastoral wilderness (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.">Isaiah 7:15</a></span>). An interesting parallel is found in the child Pollio in Vergil’s fourth Eclogue, and another from the life of Mohammed has been lately pointed out by Mr Bevan[33]. And as in these two cases a particular child is the subject of the sign, so here expositors have hazarded several guesses as to the identity of the <span class="ital">‘almâh</span>. She has been supposed to be (<span class="ital">a</span>) the wife of Isaiah, either the mother of Shearjashub, or a second wife (some identifying Immanuel with Maher-shalal-hash-baz, ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm" title="And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>), (<span class="ital">b</span>) a damsel in the harem of Ahaz (the mother of Hezekiah is excluded by the chronology), or (<span class="ital">c</span>) a young woman among the bystanders, indicated by a gesture. None of these conjectures can be pronounced altogether happy. They are all alike discredited by a certain touch of vulgarity implied in the designation of some known individual as “the damsel.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] <span class="ital">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>, Oct. 1893, pp. 220 ff. The incident is that of a Jew who was discoursing to an Arab tribe at Medina about the resurrection and the last judgment. “ ‘But,’ said they, ‘what is the <span class="ital">sign</span> (âyat, Hebr. <span class="greekheb">אוֹת</span>) of this?’ ‘A prophet,’ he answered, ‘sent from that country yonder,’ pointing with his hand towards Mecca and Yemen. ‘But when,’ they asked, ‘do you think he will come?’ Then he looked at me and said, ‘<span class="ital">If this boy reaches the full term of life, he will see him</span>.’ And in fact before another day had passed God sent His Apostle to dwell among us, and we believed on him, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An ingenious modification of the last two theories recently propounded by an American writer[34], differs from all others in excluding the prospect of deliverance from the import of the sign, whose significance is found in the <span class="ital">contrast</span> between the name of the child and his history. The name Immanuel embodies the religious optimism of the king and nation, their false trust in the protection of Jehovah; the hardships through which the child passes symbolise the providential course of events under which this delusive confidence must collapse. This interpretation, however, requires the excision of at least the latter part of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm" title="For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.">Isaiah 7:16</a></span>, and also the rejection of ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/8-9.htm" title="Associate yourselves, O you people, and you shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you of far countries: gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces....">Isaiah 8:9-10</a> as spurious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] F. C. Porter, in the <span class="ital">Journal of Biblical Literature</span>, Vol. xiv. 1895, pp. 19–36.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iv) Another line of exegesis which has commended itself to a large number of modern expositors starts from the idea that here for the first time the figure of the <span class="ital">personal Messiah</span> is flashed on Isaiah’s mind. On this view the prophecy is invested with profound religious significance, which is not the case with the two last-mentioned theories. Face to face with the craven-hearted monarch who had betrayed his trust as guardian of the liberty and independence of Judah, the prophet receives this revelation of the true King, as one born to his people in the hour of danger, sharing their poverty and affliction in his youth and waiting the time when “the government shall be upon his shoulder” and the perfect kingdom of God shall be established (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>). The attention is concentrated on the mysterious personality of the child, that of the mother falls into the background. She may be some unknown daughter of the royal house, or a nameless maiden of lowly rank; the essential fact is that in the speedy advent of Immanuel, in his name, in his experience, men will recognise the God-given “sign” of the truth of the prophet’s words. This on the whole seems to be the theory which affords the most adequate solution of the complex difficulties of the passage. It satisfies tie claims of a truly historical interpretation, and at the same time it accounts, as none of the other modern theories do, for the impassioned fervour, the indefinable atmosphere of mystery and emotion with which the words are surrounded. It is no objection to it that the anticipation remained an unrealised ideal long after the opportunity for a sign to Ahaz had passed away; for a similar remark applies to the whole conception of a personal Messiah, whose appearance Isaiah certainly expected to synchronise with the Assyrian invasion. Not the least of its recommendations, indeed, is the fact that it brings this prophecy into line with the other great Messianic prophecies of ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations....">Isaiah 9:1-7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a> ff.; and if the last words of ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm" title="And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.">Isaiah 8:8</a> are rightly rendered “thy land, O Immanuel” (which however has been disputed, see on the verse below) a link would be supplied which would make the proof almost irresistible, since no ordinary child, born or unborn, could be naturally apostrophised as the owner of the land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(v) An <span class="ital">allegorical</span> interpretation of the prophecy has been advanced by a few scholars, the “virgin” being taken as a personification of the Davidic house, or of the religious community, and the child either as the Messiah, or as a figure of the new generation; or else the birth is explained as merely a general symbol of deliverance. But all this is purely fanciful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A few words may be added in conclusion on the pre-Christian acceptation of the passage. From a very early time it seems to have been recognised that a certain mystery clung to the words, that their significance was not exhausted by the circumstances in which they were originally spoken, but that they had an eschatological reference, pointing forward to the birth of the Messiah, as the wonderful event on which all the hope of the future hung. The first trace of this tendency is found in <a href="/micah/5-3.htm" title="Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travails has brought forth: then the remnant of his brothers shall return to the children of Israel.">Micah 5:3</a> : “therefore will he (Jehovah) give them up until the time when a (certain) travailing woman hath brought forth, &c.” These words can hardly be explained otherwise than as a reference to <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>; and if it were certain that they were written by a contemporary of Isaiah they would go far to determine the sense in which the earlier prophecy should be understood. Since, however, they belong to a part of the book of Micah whose age is disputed, they may possibly represent a secondary application of Isaiah’s prophecy rather than its primary intention. A further advance in the same direction appears to be indicated by the rendering of our passage in the LXX. It is almost incredible that the use of the word <span class="greekheb">παρθένος</span> for <span class="ital">‘almâh</span> in so important a connexion should be due to mere laxity on the part of the translator. More probably it expresses a belief current in Jewish circles that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin. A good deal of evidence has been adduced to shew that such an expectation actually prevailed amongst both Alexandrian and Palestinian Jews [35], and if it existed it could hardly fail to influence the exegesis of this prophecy. It was only when the prophecy was appealed to by the Christians in proof of the Messiahship of Jesus that the Jewish exegetes seem finally to have repudiated the Messianic interpretation. They refused to admit that the word <span class="ital">‘almâh</span> could properly be translated “virgin” and fell back on one or other of the theories mentioned under (iii). The Christian Fathers on the other hand resolutely upheld the correctness of the LXX., although the post-Christian Greek versions of Aquila, Theodotion and Symmachus agree in rendering the word by <span class="greekheb">νεᾶνις</span>. The patristic view maintained an all but unquestioned ascendancy within the Church till the dawn of historical criticism in the eighteenth century, when it began to be recognised that on the philological question the Jews were right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] See Mr F.

Few prophecies have been the subject of so much controversy, or called forth such a variety of exegesis, as this prophecy of Immanuel. Rosenm&uuml;ller gives a list of twenty-eight authors who have written dissertations upon it, and himself adds a twenty-ninth. Yet the subject is far from being exhausted. It is still asked: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Were the mother and son persons belonging to the time of Isaiah himself, and if so, what persons? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Were they the Virgin Mary and her Son Jesus? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had the prophecy a double fulfillment, first in certain persons who lived in Isaiah's time, and secondly in Jesus and his mother? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> The first theory is that of the Jewish commentators. Originally, they suggested that the mother was Abi, the wife of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), and the son Hezekiah, who delivered Judah from the Assyrian power (see Justin, 'Dial. cum Tryphon.,' p. 262). But this was early disproved by showing that, according to the numbers of Kings (<a href="/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), Hezekiah was at least nine years old in the first year of Ahaz, before which this prophecy could not have been delivered (<a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). The second suggestion made identified the mother with Isaiah's wife, the "prophetess" of <a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>, and made the son a child of his, called actually Immanuel, or else his son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>) under a symbolical designation. But <span class="accented">ha-'almah</span>, "the virgin," would be a very strange title for Isaiah to have given his wife, and the rank assigned to Immanuel in <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> would not suit any son of Isaiah's. It remains to regard the '<span class="accented">almah</span> as "some young woman actually present," name, rank, and position unknown, and Immanuel as her son, also otherwise unknown (Cheyne). But the  grand exordium, "The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!" and the rank of Immanuel (<a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>), are alike against this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> The purely Messianic theory is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Dr. Kay, but without any consideration of its difficulties. The birth of Christ was an event more than seven hundred years distant. In what sense and to what persons could it be a "sign" of the coming deliverance of the land from Rezin and Pekah? And, upon the purely Messianic theory, what is the meaning of ver. 16? Syria and Samaria were, in fact, crushed within a few years of the delivery of the prophecy. Why is their desolation put off, apparently, till the coming of the Messiah, and even till he has reached a certain age? Mr. Cheyne meets these difficulties by the startling statement that Isaiah expected the advent of the Messiah to synchronize with the Assyrian invasion, and consequently thought that before Rezin and Pekah were crushed he would have reached the age of discernment. But he does not seem to see that in this case the sigma was altogether disappointing and illusory. Time is an essential element of a prophecy which turns upon the word "before" (ver. 16). If this faith of Isaiah's disciples was aroused and  their hopes raised by the announcement that Immanuel was just about to be born (Mr. Cheyne translates, "A virgin <span class="accented">is</span> with child"), what would be the revulsion of feeling when no Immanuel appeared? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">III.</span> May not the true account of the matter be that suggested by Bishop Lowth  - that the prophecy had a double bearing and a double fulfillment? "The obvious and literal meaning of the prophecy is this," he says: "that within the time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish between good and evil, that is, within a few years, the enemies of Judah should be destroyed." But the prophecy was so worded, he adds, as to have a further meaning, which wan even "the original design and <span class="accented">principal</span> intention of the prophet," viz. the Messianic one. All the expressions of the prophecy do not suit both its intentions  - some are selected with reference to the first, others with reference to the second fulfillment - but all suit one or the other, and some suit both. The first child may have received the name Immanuel (comp. Ittiel) from a faithful Jewish mother, who believed that God was with his people, whatever dangers threatened, and may have reached years of discretion about the time that Samaria was carried away captive. The second child is the true "Immanuel," "God with us," the king of <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; it is his mother who is pointed at in the expression, "the virgin," and on his account is the grand preamble; through him the people of God, the true Israel, is delivered from its spiritual enemies, sin and Satan - two kings who continually threaten it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For head of Aram is Damascus, and head of Damascus Rezin, and in five-and-sixty years will Ephraim as a people be broken in pieces. And head of Ephraim is Samaria, and head of Samaria the son of Remalyahu; if ye believe not, surely ye will not remain." The attempt to remove <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>, as a gloss at variance with the context, which is supported by Eichhorn, Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, and others, is a very natural one; and in that case the train of thought would simply be, that the two hostile kingdoms would continue in their former relation without the annexation of Judah. But when we look more closely, it is evident that the removal of <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> destroys both the internal connection and the external harmony of the clauses. For just as <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> correspond, so do <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>. Ephraim, i.e., the kingdom of the ten tribes, which has entered into so unnatural and ungodly a covenant with idolatrous Syria, will cease to exist as a nation in the course of sixty-five years; "and ye, if ye do not believe, but make flesh your arm, will also cease to exist." Thus the two clauses answer to one another: <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is a prophecy announcing Ephraim's destruction, and <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a> a warning, threatening Judah with destruction, if it rejects the promise with unbelief. Moreover, the style of <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is quite in accordance with that of Isaiah (on &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, see <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; and on &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, "away from being a people," in the sense of "so that it shall be no longer a nation," <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>). And the doctrinal objection, that the prophecy is too minute, and therefore taken ex eventu, has no force whatever, since the Old Testament prophecy furnishes an abundance of examples of the same kind (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a>., <a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>., etc.). The only objection that can well be raised is, that the time given in <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> is wrong, and is not in harmony with <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>. Now, undoubtedly the sixty-five years do not come out if we suppose the prophecy to refer to what was done by Tiglath-pileser after the Syro-Ephraimitish war, and to what was also done to Ephraim by Shalmanassar in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, to which <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a> unquestionably refers, and more especially to the former. But there is another event still, through which the existence of Ephraim, not only as a kingdom, but also as a people, was broken up - namely, the carrying away of the last remnant of the Ephraimitish population, and the planting of colonies from Eastern Asia by Esarhaddon.<p>(Note: The meaning of this king's name is Assur fratrem dedit (Asur&#775;ach&#775;yiddin): vid., Oppert, Expedition, t. ii. p. 354.)<p>on Ephraimitish soil (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>). Whereas the land of Judah was left desolate after the Chaldean deportation, and a new generation grew up there, and those who were in captivity were once more enabled to return; the land of Ephraim was occupied by heathen settlers, and the few who were left behind were melted up with these into the mixed people of the Samaritans, and those in captivity were lost among the heathen. We have only to assume that what was done to Ephraim by Esarhaddon, as related in the historical books, took place in the twenty-second and twenty-third years of Manasseh (the sixth year of Esarhaddon), which is very probable, since it must have been under Esarhaddon that Manasseh was carried away to Babylon about the middle of his reign (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); and we get exactly sixty-five years from the second year of the reign of Ahaz to the termination of Ephraim's existence as a nation (viz., Ahaz, 14; Hezekiah, 29; Manasseh, 22; in all, 65). It was then that the unconditional prediction, "Ephraim as a people will be broken in pieces," was fulfilled (ye&#772;chath me&#772;&#8219;a&#770;m; it is certainly not the 3rd pers. fut. kal, but the niphal, <a href="/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a>), just as the conditional threat "ye shall not remain" was fulfilled upon Judah in the Babylonian captivity. &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503; signifies to have a fast hold, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; to prove fast-holding. If Judah did not hold fast to its God, it would lose its fast hold by losing its country, the ground beneath its feet. We have the same play upon words in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>. The suggestion of Geiger is a very improbable one, viz., that the original reading was &#1489;&#1497; &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501;, but that &#1489;&#1497; appeared objectionable, and was altered into &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. Why should it be objectionable, when the words form the conclusion to a direct address of Jehovah Himself, which is introduced with all solemnity?
