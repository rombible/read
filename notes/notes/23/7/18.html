The comparison of a numerous army with "flies" is not uncommon; see Homer's "Iliad," B. ii. 469, etc.<p> - Thick as insects play,<p>The wandering nation of a summer's day.<p>That, drawn by milky streams at evening hours<p>In gathered swarms surround the rural bowers;<p>From pail to pail with busy murmur run<p>The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.<p>Pope.<p>The comparison is drawn probably from the "number," but also is intended to indicate the troublesome character, of the invaders. Perhaps, also, there is an allusion here to the well-known fact that one of the ten plagues of Egypt was caused by numerous swarms of flies; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-24</a>. An army would be brought up from that country as numerous, as troublesome, and as destructive as was that swarm of flies. The following description, by Bruce, of a species of flies in Abyssinia and the adjacent regions, will give an idea of the character of this calamity, and the force of the language used here:<p>'This insect is called Zimb; it has not been described by any naturalist. It is, in size, very little larger than a bee, of a thicker proportion, and has wings, which are broader than those of a bee, placed separate, like those of a fly: they are of pure gauze, without color or spot upon them; the head is large, the upper jaw or lip is sharp, and has at the end of it a strong pointed hair, of about a quarter of an inch long; the lower jaw has two of these pointed hairs; and this pencil of hairs, when joined together, makes a resistance to the finger, nearly equal to that of a strong hog's bristle; its legs are serrated in the inside, and the whole covered with brown hair or down. As soon as this plague appears, and their buzzing is heard, all the cattle forsake their food, and run wildly about the plain, until they die, worn out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. No remedy remains, but to leave the black earth, and hasten down to the sands of Atbara; and there they remain, while the rains last, this cruel enemy never daring to pursue them further.<p>Though his size be immense, as is his strength, and his body covered with a thick skin, defended with strong hair, yet even the camel is not capable to sustain the violent punctures the fly makes with his pointed proboscis. He must lose no time in removing to the sands of Atbara, for when once attacked by this fly, his body, head, and legs, break out into large bosses, which swell, break, and putrefy, to the certain destruction of the creature. Even the elephant and rhinoceros, who, by reason of their enormous bulk, and the vast quantity of food and water they daily need, cannot shift to desert and dry places as the season may require, are obliged to roll themselves in mud and mire, which, when dry, coats them over like armor, and enables them to stand their ground against this winged assassin; yet I have found some of these tubercles upon almost every elephant and rhinoceros that I have seen, and attribute them to this cause.<p>All the inhabitants of the seacoast of Melinda, down to Cape Gardefan, to Saba, and the south coast of the Red Sea, are obliged to put themselves in motion, and remove to the next sand, in the beginning of the rainy season, to prevent all their stock of cattle from being destroyed. This is not a partial emigration; the inhabitants of all the countries, from the mountains of Abyssinia northward, to the confluence of the Nile, and Astaboras, are once a year obliged to change their abode, and seek protection in the sand of Beja; nor is there any alternative, or means of avoiding this, though a hostile band were in their way, capable of spoiling them or half their substance. This fly has no sting, though he seemed to me to be rather of the bee kind; but his motion is more rapid and sudden than that of the bee, and resembles that of the gad-fly in England. There is something particular in the sound or buzzing of this insect; it is a jarring noise together with a humming, which induces me to believe it proceeds, at least in part, from a vibration made with the three hairs at his snout.'<p>The uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt - The remotest part of the land - that is, from the whole country. Egypt was watered by a single river; the Nile. But this river emptied into the Mediterranean by several mouths; and from this river also were cut numerous canals to water the land. These are intended by the "rivers" of Egypt; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6-7</a>. Those canals would be stagnant for no small part of the year; and around them would be produced, as is usual near stagnant waters, great quantities of flies. This prophecy was fulfilled by the invasion of the land in subsequent times by the Egyptians; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-2</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. hiss&#8212;whistle, to bring bees to settle (see on [695]Isa 5:26).<p>fly&#8212;found in numbers about the arms of the Nile and the canals from it (Isa 19:5-7; 23:3), here called "rivers."

The "fly of Egypt," like the "bee of Assyria," represents the military force of the nation, which God summons to take part in the coming affliction of Judaea. The prophetic glance may be extended over the entire period of Judah's decadence, and the "<span class="accented">flies"</span> summoned may include those which clustered about Neco at Megiddo, and carried off Jehoahaz from Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-34</a>). There may be allusion also to Egyptian ravages in the reigns of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon. In any general review of the period we shall find it stated that, from the time of Sargon to that of Cyrus, Judaea was the battle-ground upon which the forces of Assyria (or Assyro-Babylonia) and Egypt contended for the empire of western Asia. The desolation of the land during this period was produced almost as much by the Egyptian "<span class="accented">fly</span> as by the Assyrian <span class="accented">bee</span>." The "rivers of Egypt" are the Nile, its branches, and perhaps the great canals by which its waters were distributed. <span class="cmt_word">The bee that is in the land of Assyria</span>. The choice of the terms "<span class="accented">bee"</span> and "<span class="accented">fly</span>," to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance. Egyptian armies were swarms, hastily levied, and very imperfectly disciplined. <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> were bodies of trained troops accustomed to war, and almost as well disciplined as the Romans. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus spake Isaiah, and Jehovah through him, to the king of Judah. Whether he replied, or what reply he made, we are not informed. He was probably silent, because he carried a secret in his heart which afforded him more consolation than the words of the prophet. The invisible help of Jehovah, and the remote prospect of the fall of Ephraim, were not enough for him. His trust was in Asshur, with whose help he would have far greater superiority over the kingdom of Israel, than Israel had over the kingdom of Judah through the help of Damascene Syria. The pious, theocratic policy of the prophet did not come in time. He therefore let the enthusiast talk on, and had his own thoughts about the matter. Nevertheless the grace of God did not give up the unhappy son of David for lost. "And Jehovah continued speaking to Ahaz as follows: Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God, going deep down into Hades, or high up to the height above." Jehovah continued: what a deep and firm consciousness of the identity of the word of Jehovah and the word of the prophet is expressed in these words! According to a very marvellous interchange of idioms (Communicatio idiomatum) which runs through the prophetic books of the Old Testament, at one time the prophet speaks as if he were Jehovah, and at another, as in the case before us, Jehovah speaks as if He were the prophet. Ahaz was to ask for a sign from Jehovah his God. Jehovah did not scorn to call Himself the God of this son of David, who had so hardened his heart. Possibly the holy love with which the expression "thy God" burned, might kindle a flame in his dark heart; or possibly he might think of the covenant promises and covenant duties which the words "thy God" recalled to his mind. From this, his God, he was to ask for a sign. A sign ('oth, from 'uth, to make an incision or dent) was something, some occurrence, or some action, which served as a pledge of the divine certainty of something else. This was secured sometimes by visible miracles performed at once (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-8.htm">Exodus 4:8-9</a>), or by appointed symbols of future events (<a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>); sometimes by predicted occurrences, which, whether miraculous or natural, could not possibly be foreseen by human capacities, and therefore, if they actually took place, were a proof either retrospectively of the divine causality of other events (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), or prospectively of their divine certainty (<a href="/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-29.htm">Jeremiah 44:29-30</a>). The thing to be confirmed on the present occasion was what the prophet had just predicted in so definite a manner, viz., the maintenance of Judah with its monarchy, and the failure of the wicked enterprise of the two allied kingdoms. If this was to be attested to Ahaz in such a way as to demolish his unbelief, it could only be effected by a miraculous sign. And just as Hezekiah asked for a sign when Isaiah foretold his recovery, and promised him the prolongation of his life for fifteen years, and the prophet gave him the sign he asked, by causing the shadow upon the royal sun-dial to go backwards instead of forwards (chapter 38); so here Isaiah meets Ahaz with the offer of such a supernatural sign, and offers him the choice of heaven, earth, and Hades as the scene of the miracle. <p>&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; are either in the infinitive absolute or in the imperative; and &#1513;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; is either the imperative &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; with the He of challenge, which is written in this form in half pause instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; (for the two similar forms with pashtah and zakeph, vid., <a href="/daniel/9-19.htm">Daniel 9:19</a>), "Only ask, going deep down, or ascending to the height," without there being any reason for reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; with the tone upon the last syllable, as Hupfeld proposes, in the sense of profundam fac (or faciendo) precationem (i.e., go deep down with thy petition); or else it is the pausal subordinate form for &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, which is quite allowable in itself (cf., yechpa&#770;tz, the constant form in pause for yachpo&#772;tz, and other examples, <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>, <a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>), and is apparently preferred here on account of its consonance with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (Ewald, 93, 3). We follow the Targum, with the Sept., Syr., and Vulgate, in giving the preference to the latter of the two possibilities. It answers to the antithesis; and if we had the words before us without points, this would be the first to suggest itself. Accordingly the words would read, Go deep down (in thy desire) to Hades, or go high up to the height; or more probably, taking &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492; in the sense of gerundives, "Going deep down to Hades, or (&#1488;&#1493; from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, like vel from velle  equals  si velis, malis) going high up to the height." This offer of the prophet to perform any kind of miracle, either in the world above or in the lower world, has thrown rationalistic commentators into very great perplexity. The prophet, says Hitzig, was playing a very dangerous game here; and if Ahaz had closed with his offer, Jehovah would probably have left him in the lurch. And Meier observes, that "it can never have entered the mind of an Isaiah to perform an actual miracle:" probably because no miracles were ever performed by Gthe, to whose high poetic consecration Meier compares the consecration of the prophet as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>. Knobel answers the question, "What kind of sign from heaven would Isaiah have given in case it had been asked for?" by saying, "Probably a very simple matter." But even granting that an extraordinary heavenly phenomenon could be a "simple matter," it was open to king Ahaz not to be so moderate in his demands upon the venturesome prophet, as Knobel with his magnanimity might possibly have been. Dazzled by the glory of the Old Testament prophecy, a rationalistic exegesis falls prostrate upon the ground; and it is with such frivolous, coarse, and common words as these that it tries to escape from its difficulties. It cannot acknowledge the miraculous power of the prophet, because it believes in no miracles at all. But Ahaz had no doubt about his miraculous power, though he would not be constrained by any miracle to renounce his own plans and believe in Jehovah. "But Ahaz replied, I dare not ask, and dare not tempt Jehovah." What a pious sound this has! And yet his self-hardening reached its culminating point in these well-sounding words. He hid himself hypocritically under the mask of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, to avoid being disturbed in his Assyrian policy, and was infatuated enough to designate the acceptance of what Jehovah Himself had offered as tempting God. He studiously brought down upon himself the fate denounced in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>, and indeed not upon himself only, but upon all Judah as well. For after a few years the forces of Asshur would stand upon the same fuller's field (<a href="/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>) and demand the surrender of Jerusalem. In that very hour, in which Isaiah was standing before Ahaz, the fate of Jerusalem was decided for more than two thousand years. </body></html>
