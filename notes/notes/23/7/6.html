Being in great distress and confusion, the Jews gave up all for lost. They had made God their enemy, and knew not how to make him their friend. The prophet must teach them to despise their enemies, in faith and dependence on God. Ahaz, in fear, called them two powerful princes. No, says the prophet, they are but tails of smoking firebrands, burnt out already. The two kingdoms of Syria and Israel were nearly expiring. While God has work for the firebrands of the earth, they consume all before them; but when their work is fulfilled, they will be extinguished in smoke. That which Ahaz thought most formidable, is made the ground of their defeat; because they have taken evil counsel against thee; which is an offence to God. God scorns the scorners, and gives his word that the attempt should not succeed. Man purposes, but God disposes. It was folly for those to be trying to ruin their neighbours, who were themselves near to ruin. Isaiah must urge the Jews to rely on the assurances given them.

Probably, the two kings wished to cut off such portions of the territory of Judah as should be convenient to them, and to set a king over the remainder, who should be under their control; or to divide the whole between themselves, by setting up a king who would be tributary to both. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. vex&#8212;rather, "throw into consternation" [Gesenius].<p>make a breach&#8212;rather, "cleave it asunder."

By besieging or distressing it; or "stir it up" to war, as Jarchi interprets it: <p>and let us make a breach therein for us; in the walls of the city of Jerusalem, and enter in at it; the Targum is, <p>"let us join, and put it to us;'' <p>and so Jarchi, let us level it with us, as this valley, which is even: the sense may be, let us make a breach and division among them, and then part the kingdom between us (c); or if we cannot agree on that, let us set up a king of our own, as follows: <p>and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal; which Jarchi, by a situation of the alphabet the Jews call "albam", makes it to be the same with Remala, that is, Remaliah; and so supposes, that the intention was to set Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, over Judah; but it is not reasonable to think that the king of Syria should join in such a design; and besides, the method of interpretation, Aben Ezra says, is mere vanity; and whose sense of the words is much preferable, taking Tabeal to be the name of some great prince, either of Israel or of Syria; and so Kimchi thinks that he was a man of the children of Ephraim, whom they thought to make king in Jerusalem. The Targum understands not any particular person, but anyone that should be thought proper; and paraphrases it thus, <p>"let us appoint a king in the midst of it, who is right for us,'' <p>or pleases us; the name seems to be Syriac, see <a href="/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>. Dr. Lightfoot thinks it is the same with Tabrimmon, the name of some famous family in Syria.

We cannot, however, conclude from the name that the family of Tabeal was monotheistic (Kay), for El was one of the many Syrian gods as much as Rimmon (see Max Mailer, 'Science of Religion,' pp. 177, 178). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hofmann in his Schriftbeweis (ii. 2, 541) maintains with Knobel, that &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; cannot be shown to have any other meaning than "plant."

"And the deep darkness is scared away: menudda&#770;ch with the accusative of the object used with the passive." But this is only possible with the finite verb, not with the passive participle. <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>. "By the fact that Thou hast made the people many, Thou hast not made the joy great; but now they rejoice before Thee (who hast appeared)."

"It is Israel in its dispersion which is referred to here as a people carried away and spoiled, but which from that time forward is an object of reverential awe - a people that men have cut in pieces and trampled under foot, whose land streams have rent in pieces."

In the midst of attributes which point to ill-treatment, can this passage be meant to describe the position which Israel is henceforth to hold as one commanding respect (see our exposition)? - <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>. "Egypt the land of cities will be reduced to five cities by the judgment that falls upon it." But how can the words affirm that there will be only five cities in all, when there is nothing said about desolation in the judgment predicted before? - <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1-10</a>.

Consequently tsemed pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m does not mean pairs of horsemen, but carriages full of men and drawn by horses. But we can see what tsemed pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m is from <a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a> (ro&#772;khebh&#305;&#772;m tsema&#770;d&#305;&#772;m), and from the combination of rekhebh and pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m (chariots and horsemen) in <a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>.
