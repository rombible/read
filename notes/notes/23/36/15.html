In contrast with what he derides as trust in a God who was against those who trusted Him, he offers tangible material advantages They have only to leave the besieged city, and to go to the Assyrian camp, and they will be allowed provisionally to occupy their own houses and till their own fields, and, instead of dying of thirst, shall have each man the waters of his own cistern; and then, not without a latent sarcasm, worse than the <span class= "ital">vœ victis </span>which is the normal utterance of conquerors, he offers the doom of exile as if it were a change for the better, and not the worse, as though the conquered had no love of country as such, no reverence for the sepulchres of their fathers, no yearning for the Temple of their God.

The Jews had now no other refuge but God, and as long as they put their confidence there, even Rabshakeh knew that it was hazardous to attempt to take and destroy their city. It was his policy, therefore, first to endeavor to undermine their reliance on God, before he could have any hope of success.

Hezekiah trusted in the Lord himself, and he endeavoured, both by his own example, and by arguments, to persuade his people to do so likewise; of this Rabshakeh was sensible, and was more afraid of this than of any thing else, and, therefore laboured this point more than any other; see <a href="/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a>; <p>saying, the Lord will surely deliver us, this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria: which he might say with the greatest confidence, since the Lord had promised to defend it, <a href="/isaiah/31-5.htm">Isaiah 31:5</a> and especially if his sickness, and recovery out of it, and promises then made to him, were before this, as some think; since it is expressly promised by the Lord, that he would deliver him and the city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, <a href="/isaiah/38-6.htm">Isaiah 38:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">The Lord will surely deliver us</span>] Cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/37-35.htm" title="For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.">Isaiah 37:35</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah</span>. There is nothing improbable in Rabshakeh's having thus spoken. Isaiah had long been encouraging Hezekiah to resist Sennacherib by promises of Divine aid (<a href="/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-9</a>). Hezekiah would naturally repeat these premises to the people, and could not give their effect in simpler words than by saying, "Jehovah will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria." Spies and deserters would naturally tell the Assyrian envoys what he had said. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hezekiah's confidential ministers go there also. <a href="/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a> (K. "And they called to the king), and there went out to him (K. to them) Eliakim son of Hilkiyahu, the house-minister, and Shebna the chancellor, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder." On the office of the house-minister, or major-domo, which was now filled by Eliakim instead of Shebna (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1488;, K. twice &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;), see <a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15</a>.; and on that of so&#772;phe&#772;r and mazk&#305;&#772;r. Rabshakeh's message follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-4.htm">Isaiah 36:4-10</a> : "And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now to Hizkiyahu, Thus saith the great king, the king of Asshur, What sort of confidence is this that thou hast got? I say (K. thou sayest, i.e., thou talkest), vain talk is counsel and strength for war: now, then, in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me? (K. Now) Behold, thou trustest (K. &#1500;&#1468;&#1498;) in this broken reed-staff there, in Egypt, on which one leans, and it runs into his hand and pierces it; so does Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. But if thou sayest to me (K. ye say), We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hizkiyahu has removed, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before the altar (K. ads, in Jerusalem)? And now take a wager with my lord (K. with) the king of Asshur; I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou art able for thy part to give horsemen upon them. And how couldst thou repel the advance of a single satrap among the least of the servants of my lord?! Thou puttest thy trust then in Egypt for chariots and riders! And (omitted in K.) now have I come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it (K. against this place, to destroy it)? Jehovah said to me, Go up to (K. against) this land, and destroy it." The chronicler has a portion of this address of Rabshakeh in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-10.htm">2 Chronicles 32:10-12</a>. And just as the prophetic words in the book of Kings have a Deuteronomic sound, and those in the Chronicles the ring of a chronicle, so do Rabshakeh's words, and those which follow, sound like the words of Isaiah himself. "The great king" is the standing royal title appended to the names of Sargon and Sennacherib upon the Assyrian monuments (compare <a href="/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>). Hezekiah is not thought worthy of the title of king, ether here or afterwards. The reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="/isaiah/36-5.htm">Isaiah 36:5</a> (thou speakest vain talk) is not the preferable one, because in that case we should expect &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;, or rather (according to the usual style) &#1488;&#1498; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;. The meaning is, that he must look upon Hezekiah's resolution, and his strength (&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; connected as in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>) for going to war, as mere boasting ("lip-words," as in <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>), and must therefore assume that there was something in the background of which he was well aware. And this must be Egypt, which would not only be of no real help to its ally, but would rather do him harm by leaving him in the lurch. The figure of a reed-staff has been borrowed by Ezekiel in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6-7</a>. It was a very appropriate one for Egypt, with its abundance of reeds and rushes (<a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>), and it has Isaiah's peculiar ring (for the expression itself, compare <a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a>, and other passages). &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; does not mean fragile (Luzz. quella fragil canna), but broken, namely, in consequence of the loss of the throne by the native royal family, from whom it had been wrested by the Ethiopians (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-7</a>), and the defeats sustained at the hands of Sargon (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1-6</a>). The construction cui quis innitur et intrat is paratactic for cui si quis. In <a href="/isaiah/36-7.htm">Isaiah 36:7</a> the reading &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; commends itself, from the fact that the sentence is not continued with &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514;; but as Hezekiah is addressed throughout, and it is to him that the reply is to be made, the original reading was probably &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. The fact that Hezekiah had restricted the worship of Jehovah to Jerusalem, by removing the other places of worship (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), is brought against him in a thoroughly heathen, and yet at the same time (considering the inclination to worship other gods which still existed in the nation) a very crafty manner. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>, he throws in his teeth, with most imposing scorn, his own weakness as compared with Asshur, which was chiefly dreaded on account of its strength in cavalry and war-chariots. &#1504;&#1488; &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; does not refer to the performance and counter-performance which follow, in the sense of "connect thyself" (Luzz. associati), but is used in a similar sense to the Omeric &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, though with the idea of vying with one another, not of engaging in war (the synonym in the Talmud is himra&#770;h, to bet, e.g., b. Sabbath 31a): a bet and a pledge are kindred notions (Heb. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, cf., Lat. vadari). On pecha&#770;h (for pacha&#770;h), which also occurs as an Assyrian title in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, two constructives, the first of which is to be explained according to Ewald, 286, a (compare above, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>, &#1499;&#1489;&#1491; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), form the logical regens of the following servorum dominin mei minimorum; and he&#772;sh&#305;&#772;bh pene&#772; does not mean here to refuse a petitioner, but to repel an antagonist (<a href="/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>). The fut. consec. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; deduces a consequence: Hezekiah could not do anything by himself, and therefore he trusted in Egypt, from which he expected chariots and horsemen. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a>, the prophetic idea, that Asshur was the instrument employed by Jehovah (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, etc.), is put into the mouth of the Assyrian himself. This is very conceivable, but the colouring of Isaiah is undeniable. </body></html>
