In 2 Kings 18; 2 Chronicles 32, we have the previous history of the war. Hezekiah, on hearing Sennacherib’s reproach, began to strengthen the fortifications of Jerusalem, called his officers and troops together, and made an appeal to their faith and courage. In Isaiah 22 we have the prophet’s view of those preparations. Probably by Isaiah’s advice, who put no confidence in this boastful and blustering courage, Hezekiah sent to Sennacherib, who was then besieging Lachish, to sue for peace, acknowledging that he had offended. A penalty of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold was imposed and paid, Hezekiah being reduced to empty his own treasury and that of the Temple, and even to strip the Temple doors and pillars of the plates of gold with which they were overlaid. Peace, however, was not to be had even at that price. Encouraged, perhaps, by this prompt submission, and tearing up the treaty (the breach of covenant of which Isaiah complains in <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm" title="The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.">Isaiah 35:1</a>), Sennacherib sent his officers, the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh (the names are all official titles) to demand an unconditional surrender.<p><span class= "bld">He stood by the conduit of the upper pool.</span>—The spot was the same as that at which Isaiah had addressed Ahaz thirty or more years before (<a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;">Isaiah 7:3</a>).

In regard to Tartan, see the note at <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>. It is probable that Rabshakeh only is mentioned in Isaiah because the expedition may have been mainly under his direction, or more probably because he was the principal speaker on the occasion to which he refers.<p>From Lachish - This was a city in the south of the tribe of Judah, and was southwest of Jerusalem <a href="/joshua/10-23.htm">Joshua 10:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>. It was situated in a plain, and was the seat of an ancient Canaanite king. It was rebuilt and fortified by Rehoboam <a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>. It was in some respects a border town, and was a defense against the incursions of the Philistines. It was therefore situated between Jerusalem and Egypt, and was in the direct way of Sennacherib in his going to Egypt, and on his return. It lay, according to Eusebius and Jerome, seven Roman miles from Eleutheropolis toward the south. No trace of the town, however, is now to be found (see Robinson's "Bib. Researches," vol. ii. pp. 388, 389).<p>With a great army - Sennacherib remained himself for a time at Lachish, though he followed not long after. It is probable that he sent forward a considerable portion of his immense army, retaining only so many forces as he judged would be necessary to carry on the siege of Lachish. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>, it is said that Sennacherib, while he sent his servants to Jerusalem, 'laid siege to Lachish and all his power with him;' but this must mean that he retained with him a considerable part of his army, and doubtless all that contributed to his magnificence and splendor. The word 'power' in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>, means also 'dominion' (see the margin), and denotes all the insignia of royalty: and this might have been retained while a considerable part of his forces had been sent forward to Jerusalem.<p>And he stood - He halted; he encamped there; He intended to make that the point of attack.<p>By the conduit ... - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This message was sent, Bishop Usher says, three years after the former expedition: <p>and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers' field; where they spread their clothes, as the Targum, having washed them in the pool, of which see <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>. Ben Melech thus describes the pool, conduit, and highway: the pool is a ditch, built with stone and lime, where rainwater was collected, or where they drew water from the fountain, and the waters were gathered into this pool; and there was in this pool a hole, which they stopped, until the time they pleased to fetch water, out of the pool: and the conduit was a ditch near to the pool, and they brought water out of the pool into the conduit, when they chose to drink, or wash garments: the highway was a way paved with stones, so that they could walk upon it in rainy days; and here they stood and washed their garments in the waters of the conduit, and in the field they spread them to the sun. This pool lay outside the city, yet just by the walls of it, which showed the daring insolence of Rabshakeh to come so very nigh, for he was in the hearing of the men upon the walls, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a>, this Rabshakeh is by the Jewish writers thought to be an apostate Jew, because he spoke in the Jews' language; and some of them, as Jerome says, will have him to be a son of the Prophet Isaiah's, but without any foundation, Procopius, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>, thinks it probable that he was a Hebrew, who either had fled on his own accord to the Assyrians, or was taken captive by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army.

It is inconceivable that, immediately after the grant of terms of peace and their acceptance, Sennacherib should have renewed the war; there must have been an interval, and a fresh provocation. The interval can have been only a short one, since Hezekiah died in  <span class="date">B.C. 697</span>. It may have been a couple of years, or perhaps no more than a year, or possibly only a few months. The fresh provocation probably consisted in an application for aid, made by Hezekiah to Tir-hakah, or to the subordinate Egyptian kings, which is glanced at in ver. 6. The Assyrian annals, which never record any reverse or defeat, are wholly silent as to this second expedition. The only profane confirmation of it is to be found in Herodotus (2:141). <span class="cmt_word">From Lackish</span>. Laehish, an ancient city of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>), was assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), and seems to have been still a Jewish possession (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>). It occupied "a low round swell or knoll" in the Shefelch, or low tract between the Judaean highland and the Mediterranean, and lay near, if not directly on, the direct route which armies commonly followed in their march from Syria into Egypt. The site is now known as <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; it lies between Gaza and <span class="accented">Ajlan</span> (Eglon), about two miles west of the hitter. Sennacherib represents himself as engaged in its siege on a bas-relief in the British Museum (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh," second series, pl. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The conduit of the upper pool</span> (see the comment on ch. 7:3). The spot was that at which Isaiah had been commanded to meet Ahaz some forty years previously. It was probably on the north side of Jerusalem, not tar from the Damascus gate. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame man leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb man shout; for waters break out in the desert, and brooks in the steppe. And the mirage becomes a fish-pond, and the thirsty ground gushing water-springs; in the place of jackals, where it lies, there springs up grass with reeds and rushes." The bodily defects mentioned here there is no reason for regarding as figurative representations of spiritual defects. The healing of bodily defects, however, is merely the outer side of what is actually effected by the coming of Jehovah (for the other side, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3-4</a>). And so, also, the change of the desert into a field abounding with water is not a mere poetical ornament; for in the last times, he era of redemption, nature itself will really share in the doxa which proceeds from the manifested God to His redeemed. Sha&#770;ra&#770;b (Arab. sara&#770;b) is essentially the same thing as that which we call in the western languages the mirage, or Fata morgana; not indeed every variety of this phenomenon of the refraction of light, through strata of air of varying density lying one above another, but more especially that appearance of water, which is produced as if by magic in the dry, sandy desert<p>(Note: See. G. Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. p. 38.)<p>(literally perhaps the "desert shine," just as we speak of the "Alpine glow;" see <a href="/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>). The antithesis to this is 'a&#774;gam (Chald. 'agma&#770;', Syr. egmo, Ar. agam), a fish-pond (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, different from 'a&#770;ga&#770;m in <a href="/isaiah/19-10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>). In the arid sandy desert, where the jackal once had her lair and suckled her young (this is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, the true explanation of the permutative ribhtsa&#770;h, for which ribhtsa&#770;m would be in some respects more suitable), grass springs up even into reeds and rushes; so that, as <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a> affirms, the wild beasts of the desert praise Jehovah. </body></html>
