Even before that persecution burst out in its full violence, the “righteous” survivors of Hezekiah’s <span class= "ital">régime </span>may well have vexed their souls even to death with the evils that were around them. The prophet finds comfort in the thought that their death was a deliverance from yet worse evils. The singular number points to the few conspicuous sufferers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/57.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/57-1.htm" title="The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come....">Isaiah 57:1-2</a></span>. These two verses “contain a kind of prelude to the distressful scene which is opened immediately after: for the prophet, designing to describe the melancholy state of the <span class="ital">adulterous church, </span>to be chastised by the severe judgments of God, beholds, as it were in an ecstasy, the few pious and good men yet remaining in the church gradually falling off, and taken away, either by an immature or violent death: while there were but few who laid this matter to heart, and observed it as a presage of the judgment threatening the church. This stupidity he sadly deplores; immediately subjoining, however: an alleviation, to show that this complaint pertained not to the deceased, as having attained a happier lot, and as blessed in this respect, that they were taken away from the evils and calamities of their times.” — Vitringa. The following short paraphrase on the words will render their sense more apparent. <span class="ital">The righteous perisheth</span> — Just and holy men, who are the pillars of the place and state in which they live. <span class="ital">And no man layeth it to heart — </span>Few or none of the people are duly affected with this severe stroke and sign of God’s displeasure. Thus he shows that the corruption was general in the people no less than in the priests. <span class="ital">And merciful men </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אנשׁי חסד</span>, <span class="ital">men of benignity, </span>or <span class="ital">beneficence, </span>the same whom he before called <span class="ital">righteous: </span>those whose practice it was, not only to exercise piety and justice, but also mercy and kindness; <span class="ital">none considering </span>— None reflecting within himself, and laying it to heart; <span class="ital">that the righteous is taken away from the evil </span>— That dreadful calamities are coming on the church and nation, and that the righteous are taken away before they come. <span class="ital">He shall enter into peace </span>— The righteous man shall be received into rest and safety, where he shall be out of the reach of the approaching miseries. <span class="ital">They </span>— The merciful men; <span class="ital">shall rest in their beds </span>— In their graves, not unfitly called their <span class="ital">beds, </span>or sleeping- places, death being commonly called <span class="ital">sleep </span>in Scripture; <span class="ital">each one walking in his uprightness </span>— That walked, that is, lived, in a sincere and faithful discharge of his duties to God and men. Vitringa thinks “the completion of this prophecy is to be sought in the latter end of the ninth, and in the following centuries; when the papal power greatly prevailed, and the corruption of the church was as great as the persecutions and troubles of the pious were many.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>57:1,2 The righteous are delivered from the sting of death, not from the stroke of it. The careless world disregards this. Few lament it as a public loss, and very few notice it as a public warning. They are taken away in compassion, that they may not see the evil, nor share in it, nor be tempted by it. The righteous man, when he dies, enters into peace and rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteous perisheth - This refers, as I suppose, to the time of Manasseh (see the Introduction, Section 3). Grotius supposes, that it refers to king Josiah; Vitringa, that it refers to martyrs in general. But it seems probable to me that the prophet designs to describe the state of stupidity which prevailed in his own time, and to urge as one proof of it, that the pious part of the nation was taken away by violent death, and that the nation was not affected by it. Such was the guilt of Manasseh; so violent was the persecution which he excited against the just, that it is said of him that he 'shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another' <a href="/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>. There is evidence (see the Introduction, Section 2), that <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54.htm">Isaiah 54</a>ed to his time, and it is probable that he himself ultimately fell a victim to the race of Manasseh. Though he had, on account of his great age, retired from the public functions of the prophetic office, yet he could not be insensible to the existence of these evils, and his spirit would not suffer him to be silent even though bowed down by age, when the land was filled with abominations, and when the best blood of the nation was poured out like water. The word rendered 'perisheth' (&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;  'a&#772;bad) as well as the word rendered 'taken away' (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  'a&#770;saph) denotes violence, and is indicative of the fact that they were removed by a premature death.<p>And no man layeth it to heart - No one is aroused by it, or is concerned about it. The sentiment of the passage is, that it is proof of great stupidity and guilt when people see the righteous die without concern. If the pious die by persecution and others are not aroused, it shows that they acquiesce in it, or have no confidence in God, and no desire that his people should be preserved; if they die in the ordinary mode and the people are unaffected, it shows their stupidity. The withdrawment of a pious man from the earth is a public calamity. His prayers, his example, his life, were among the richest blessings of the world, and people should be deeply affected when they are withdrawn; and it shows their guilt and stupidity when they see this with indifference. It increases the evidence of this guilt when, as is sometimes the case, the removal of the righteous by death is an occasion of joy. The wicked hate the secret rebuke which is furnished by a holy life, and they often feel a secret exultation when such people die.<p>And merciful men - Margin, 'Men of kindness,' or 'godliness.' Lowth and Noyes render it, 'Pious men.' The Septuagint, &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Andres dikaioi - 'Just men.' The Hebrew word denotes "mercy" or "kindness" (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;  chesed). Here it probably means, 'Men of mercy;' that is, people who are the subjects of mercy; people who are pious, or devoted to God.<p>Are taken away - Hebrew, 'Are gathered.' That is, they are gathered to their fathers by death.<p>None considering - They were not anxious to know what was the design of Divine Providence in permitting it.<p>From the evil to come - Margin, 'That which is evil.' The idea here evidently is, that severe calamities were coming upon the nation. God was about to give them up to foreign invasion (<a href="/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a> ff); and the true reason why the just were removed was, that they may not be subject to the divine wrath which should come upon the nation; they were not to be required to contemplate the painful state of things when an enemy should fire the cities, the palaces, and the temple, and cause the sacred services of religion to cease. It was a less evil for them to be removed by death - even by the painful death of persecution - than to be compelled to participate in these coming sorrows. At the same time this passage may be regarded as inculcating a more general truth still. It is, that the pious are often removed in order that they may not be exposed to evils which they would experience should they live. There might be the pains and sorrows of persecution; there might be long and lingering disease; there might be poverty and want; there might be the prevalence of iniquity and infidelity over which their hearts would bleed; there might be long and painful conflicts with their own evil hearts, or there might be danger that they would fall into sin, and dishonor their high calling. For some or all these reasons the righteous may be withdrawn from the world; and could we see those reasons as God does, nothing more would be necessary to induce us to acquiesce entirely in the justice of his dealings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 57<p>Isa 57:1-21.

The translation is perfectly admissible, and the thought is in accordance with the religious sentiment of the O.T.

There is nothing to indicate that “the evil” is future, nor is it likely that the prophet has in view a future of terror for the righteous. The clause may be equally well rendered <span class="bld">that</span> (or <span class="bld">for</span>) <span class="bld">the righteous is swept away before the evil;</span> and this is probably all that is meant.

But there were exceptions to the rule. Wicked persecutors, like Ahab, Jezebel, and Athaliah, cut off the righteous ere they had seen half their days. So probably did Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>). And God sometimes removed the righteous from earth by a natural death before they had grown old (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>).

Jehovah will bring them along with His people to the holy mountain, upon which His temple rises once more; there will He cause them to rejoice, and all that they place upon His altar will find a most gracious acceptance. It is impossible that the prophet should be thinking here of the worship of the future without sacrifice, although in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> he predicts the self-sacrifice of the "Servant of Jehovah," which puts an end to all animals sacrifices. But here the temple is called "the house of prayer," from the prayer which is the soul of all worship. It will be called a house of prayer for all nations; and therefore its nature will correspond to its name. This ultimate intention is already indicated in Solomon's dedicatory prayer (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41-43</a>); but our prophet was the first to give it this definite universal expression. Throughout this passage the spirit of the law is striving to liberate itself from its bondage. Nor is there anything to surprise us in the breaking down of the party wall, built up so absolutely between the eunuchs on the one hand and the congregation on the other, or the one partially erected between the heathen and the congregation of Israel; as we may see from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a>, where it is affirmed that Jehovah will even take priests and Levites out of the midst of the heathen whom Israel will bring back with it into its own land. </body></html>
