With the Lord there is neither beginning of days, nor end of life, nor change of time. His name is holy, and all must know him as a holy God. He will have tender regard to those who bring their mind to their condition, and dread his wrath. He will make his abode with those whose hearts he has thus humbled, in order to revive and comfort them. When troubles last long, even good men are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God. Therefore He will not contend for ever, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands, nor defeat the purchase of his Son's blood. Covetousness is a sin that particularly lays men under the Divine displeasure. See the sinfulness of sin. See also that troubles cannot reform men unless God's grace work in them. Peace shall be published, perfect peace. It is the fruit of preaching lips, and praying lips. Christ came and preached peace to Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to those of that age. But the wicked would not be healed by God's grace, therefore would not be healed by his comforts. Their ungoverned lusts and passions made them like the troubled sea. Also the terrors of conscience disturbed their enjoyments. God hath said it, and all the world cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those who allow themselves in any sin. If we are recovered from such an awful state, it is only by the grace of God. And the influences of the Holy Spirit, and that new heart, from whence comes grateful praise, the fruit of our lips, are his gift. Salvation, with all its fruits, hopes, and comforts, is his work, and to him belongs all the glory. There is no peace for the wicked man; but let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I create the fruit of the lips - The Chaldee and Syriac render this, 'The words of the lips.' The 'fruit' of the lips is that which the lips produce, that is, words; and the reference here is doubtless to offerings of praise and thanksgiving. See <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>; where the phrase, 'fruit of the lips' (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  karpos cheileo&#772;n), is explained to mean praise. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>, where the expression, 'we will render the calves of the lips,' means that they would offer praise. The sense here is, that God bestowed such blessings as made thanksgiving proper, and thus, he 'created the fruit of the lips.'<p>Peace, peace - The great subject of the thanksgiving would be peace. The peace here referred to probably had a primary reference to the cessation of the calamities which would soon overwhelm the Jewish nation, and their restoration again to their own land. But the whole strain of the passage also shows that the prophet had a more general truth in his view, and that he refers to that peace which would diffuse joy among all who were far off, and those who were near. Paul evidently alludes to this passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-17</a>. Thus understood, the more general reference is to the peace. which the Messiah would introduce, and which would lay the foundation for universal rejoicing and praise (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>).<p>To him that is far off - Applied by the apostle Paul to the Gentiles, who are represented as having been far off from God, or as aliens or strangers to him <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>.<p>And to him that is near - That is, to the Jewish people <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>, represented as having been comparatively near to God in the enjoyment of religious privileges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. fruit of &#8230; lips&#8212;that is, thanksgivings which flow from the lips.

"I will proclaim thy righteousness; and thy works, they will not profit thee. When thou criest, let thy heaps of idols save thee: but a wind carries them all away; a breath takes them off; and whoever putteth trust in me will inherit the land, and take possession of my holy mountain." According to the context, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1498; cannot be a synonym of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; f here. It is neither salvation nor the way of salvation that is intended; nor is this even included, as Stier supposes. But the simple reference is to what Israel in its blindness regarded as righteousness; whereas, if it had known itself, it would have seen that it was the most glaring opposite. This lying-righteousness of Israel would be brought to a judicial exposure by Jehovah. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; is not a second accusative to &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, for in that case we should have &#1493;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1498;; but it commences a second sentence, as the accents really indicate. When Jehovah begins thus to speak and act, the impotence of the false gods which His people have made for themselves will soon be exposed; and "as for thy works (i.e., thine idols, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>), they will do thee no good" (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-10</a>, compare <a href="/jeremiah/23-33.htm">Jeremiah 23:33</a>; for the question &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;), here an empatic elevation of the subject, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;, Ewald,  277, p. 683). This determines the meaning of &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498;, which Knobel supposes to refer to the large army of the Babylonians, with which the apostates among the exiles had formed an offensive and defensive alliance. But the term is really applied to the heaps (qibbu&#772;ts, collectio, not an adjective of the form limmu&#772;d) of different idols, with which Israel had furnished itself even in its captivity (compare qibba&#770;tsa&#770;h in <a href="/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>). It was in vain for them to turn to these pantheons of theirs; a single ru&#772;a&#774;ch would carry them all away, a hebhel would sweep them off, for they themselves were nothing but hebhel and ru&#772;a&#774;ch (<a href="/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>). The proper punctuation here is &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;; the first syllable of &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;, which is attached to a word with a disjunctive accent, has a so-called heavy Gaya, the second a euphonic Gaya, according to rules which are too little discussed in our grammars. When Knobel supports his explanation of &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498; on the ground that the idols in <a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a> and the worshippers of Jehovah in <a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a> do not form a fitting antithesis, the simple reply is, that the contrast lies between the idols, which cannot save, and Jehovah, who not only saves those who trust in Him, but sends them prosperity according to His promises. With the promise, "Whoso trusts in me will inherit the land," this prophecy reaches the thought with which the previous prophecy (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7-8</a>) closed; and possibly what is here affirmed of &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498; forms an intentional antithesis to the promise there, &#1500;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;: when Jehovah gathers His faithful ones from the dispersion, and gathers others to them (from among the heathen), then will the plunder which the faithless have gathered together be all scattered to the winds. And whilst the latter stand forsaken by their powerless works, the former will be established in the peaceful inheritance of the promised land. The first half of the prophecy closes here. It is full of reproach, and closes with a brief word of promise, which is merely the obverse of the threat. The second half follows an opposite course. Jehovah will redeem His people, provided it has been truly humbled by the sufferings appointed, for He has seen into what errors it has fallen since He has withdrawn His mercy from it.
