With the Lord there is neither beginning of days, nor end of life, nor change of time. His name is holy, and all must know him as a holy God. He will have tender regard to those who bring their mind to their condition, and dread his wrath. He will make his abode with those whose hearts he has thus humbled, in order to revive and comfort them. When troubles last long, even good men are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God. Therefore He will not contend for ever, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands, nor defeat the purchase of his Son's blood. Covetousness is a sin that particularly lays men under the Divine displeasure. See the sinfulness of sin. See also that troubles cannot reform men unless God's grace work in them. Peace shall be published, perfect peace. It is the fruit of preaching lips, and praying lips. Christ came and preached peace to Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to those of that age. But the wicked would not be healed by God's grace, therefore would not be healed by his comforts. Their ungoverned lusts and passions made them like the troubled sea. Also the terrors of conscience disturbed their enjoyments. God hath said it, and all the world cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those who allow themselves in any sin. If we are recovered from such an awful state, it is only by the grace of God. And the influences of the Holy Spirit, and that new heart, from whence comes grateful praise, the fruit of our lips, are his gift. Salvation, with all its fruits, hopes, and comforts, is his work, and to him belongs all the glory. There is no peace for the wicked man; but let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the iniquity of his covetousness - The guilt of his avarice; that is, of the Jewish people. The word rendered here 'covetousness' (&#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  betsa&#8219;) means "plunder, rapine, prey"; then unjust gains, or lucre from bribes <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; or by any other means. Here the sense is, that one of the prevailing sins of the Jewish people which drew upon them the divine vengeance, was avarice, or the love of gain. Probably this was especially manifest in the readiness with which those who dispensed justice received bribes (compare <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>). See also <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a> : 'For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness.'<p>And smote him - That is, I brought heavy judgments on the Jewish people.<p>I hid me - I withdrew the evidences of my presence and the tokens of my favor, and left them to themselves.<p>And he went on frowardly - Margin, 'Turning away.' That is, abandoned by me, the Jewish people declined from my service and sunk deeper into sin. The idea here is, that if God withdraws from his people, such is their tendency to depravity, that they will wander away from him, and sink deeper in guilt a truth which is manifest in the experience of individuals, as well as of communities and churches. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. covetousness&#8212;akin to idolatry; and, like it, having drawn off Israel's heart from God (Isa 2:7; 56:11; 58:3; Jer 6:13; Col 3:5).<p>hid me&#8212;(Isa 8:17; 45:15).<p>went on frowardly&#8212;the result of God's hiding His face (Ps 81:12; Ro 1:24, 26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Covetousness; </span> of which sin the Jews were eminently guilty, as is expressly affirmed, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm" title="For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.">Jeremiah 6:13</a> 8:10</span>.

Yet you have robbed me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.">Malachi 3:8</a>; Nehemiah 5. These passages shew that a sordid, avaricious spirit was characteristic of the returned exiles, although on the other hand <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm" title="For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.">Jeremiah 6:13</a> shews that it was prevalent before the Captivity (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm" title="And they come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.">Ezekiel 33:31</a>). The same feature is touched on in ch. <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm" title="Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.">Isaiah 56:11</a> and in ch. 58. The significant thing is that it is specified as the besetting sin of the time, and this again appears to indicate that the people spoken of are distinct from those who were guilty of the more heinous offences enumerated in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?...">Isaiah 57:5-9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">covetousness</span> is strictly “gain”; (<a href="/genesis/37-26.htm" title="And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?">Genesis 37:26</a>) then <span class="bld">unjust gain</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I hid me, and was wroth</span>] <span class="bld">hiding myself in my wrath</span> (lit. “hiding and being wroth”; see Davidson’s <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, § 87 R. 1).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he went on frowardly</span>] (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm" title="Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.

Among the sins that angered God most against the Jews of the later kingdom of Judah was their covetousness - that desire of unjust gain which led them continually to oppress their weaker brethren, to remove their neighbours' landmarks, to harass them with lawsuits, to obtain from the courts corrupt judgments against them, and so to strip them of their inheritances (see <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5, 14, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>, etc.). This was far from being their only sin; but it was their besetting sin, and it led on to a number of others. It would seem even to have been the principal cause of those judicial murders with which they are so constantly taxed by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 21</a>: 33:15; 59:3; <a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; <a href="/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>; <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>). Isaiah selects the sin of covetousness here, as typical or representative of the entire class of Judah's besetting sins - the most striking indication of that alienation of their hearts from God, which constituted their real guilt, and was the true cause of their punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And smote him</span>. The form of the verb marks <span class="accented">repeated</span> action. God gave Judah many warning's before the final catastrophe. He punished Judah by the hand of Sargon, by that of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>), by that of Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), by that of Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>), by that of the Syrians, the Moabites and the Ammonites (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and others, during the hundred and forty years which intervened between the accession of Hezekiah and the completion of the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">I hid me</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/57.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From fear of man, Israel, and still more Judah, had given up the fear of Jehovah. "And of whom hast thou been afraid, and (whom) didst thou fear, that thou becamest a liar, and didst not continue mindful of me, and didst not take it to heart?" It was of men - only mortal men, with no real power (<a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>) - that Israel was so needlessly afraid, that it resorted to lies and treachery to Jehovah (k&#305;&#772;, ut, an interrogative sentence, as in <a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>): purchasing the favour of man out of the fear of man, and throwing itself into the arms of false tutelar deities, it banished Jehovah its true shelter out of its memory, and did not take it to heart, viz., the sinfulness of such infidelity, and the eventful consequences by which it was punished (compare <a href="/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>).<p>With <a href="/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a> the reproaches are addressed to the present. The treachery of Israel had been severely punished in the catastrophe of which the captivity was the result, but without effecting any improvement. The great mass of the people were as forgetful of God as ever, and would not be led to repentance by the long-suffering of God, which had hitherto spared them from other well-merited punishments. "Am I not silent, and that for a long time, whereas thou wast not afraid of me?" A comparison with <a href="/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a> will show that the prophecy returns here to its ordinary style. The lxx and Jerome render the passage as if the reading were &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; (viz., &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, quasi non videns), and this is the reading which Lowth adopts. We may see from this, that the original text had a defective &#1493;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, which was intended, however, to be read &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;. The prophet applies the term &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m (see <a href="/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>) to the captivity, which had already lasted a long time - a time of divine silence: the silence of His help so fas as the servants of Jehovah were concerned, but the silence of His wrath as to the great mass of the people. </body></html>
