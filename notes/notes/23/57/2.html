The careless world disregards this. Few lament it as a public loss, and very few notice it as a public warning.

So the margin. Vulgate, 'Peace shall come.' Septuagint, 'His sepulture (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  he&#772; taphe&#772; autou) shall be in peace.' The idea is, that by his death the righteous man shall enter into rest. He shall get away from conflict, strife, agitation, and distress. This may either refer to the peaceful rest of the grave, or to that which awaits the just in a better world. The direct meaning here intended is probably the former, since the grave is often spoken of as a place of rest. Thus Job J<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/3-17.htm">Obadiah 3:17</a>, speaking of the grave, says:<p>There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary be at rest.<p>The connection here seems also to demand the same sense, as it is immediately added, 'they shall rest in their beds.' The grave is a place of peace:<p>Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear,<p>Invade thy bounds; no mortal woes<p>Can reach the peaceful sleeper here,<p>While angels watch the soft repose.<p> - Watts<p>At the same time it is true that the dying saint 'goes in peace!' He has calmness in his dying, as well as peace in his grave. He forgives all who have injured him; prays for all who have persecuted him; and peacefully and calmly dies. He lies in a peaceful grave - often represented in the Scriptures as a place of repose, where the righteous 'sleep' in the hope of being awakened in the morning of the resurrection. He enters into the rest of heaven - the world of perfect and eternal repose. No persecution comes there; no trial awaits him there; no calamity shall meet him there. Thus, in all respects, the righteous leave the world in peace; and thus death ceases to be a calamity, and this most dreaded of all evils is turned into the highest blessing.<p>They shall rest in their beds - That is, in their graves.<p>Each one walking in his uprightness - Margin, 'Before him.' The word &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;  nakkoch means "straight, right," and is used of one who walks straight forward. It here means an upright man, who is often represented as walking in a straight path in opposition to sinners, who are represented as walking in crooked ways <a href="/psalms/125-5.htm">Psalm 125:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>.

Or, "he entereth into peace"; in contrast to the persecutions which he suffered in this world (Job 3:13, 17).

Or "shall go in peace" (d); the righteous man goes in peace now; he has peace from his justifying righteousness; he has peace through believing in Christ; he has peace in, though not from, his obedience and holiness of life; and he has peace in the midst of the many trials he is exercised with; and he goes out of the world in peace, with great serenity and tranquillity of mind, as Simeon desired he might, having views of an interest in Christ, and in the glories of another world; and as soon as he is departed from hence he enters into peace, into a state where there is everything that makes for peace; there is the God of peace; there is Christ, the Prince of peace; there is the Spirit, whose fruit is peace; and there are the angels of peace, and good men, the sons of peace: and there is nothing there to disturb their peace, no sin within, nor Satan's temptations without, nor any wicked men to annoy and molest them; and there is everything that can come under the notion of peace and prosperity; for the happiness of this state is signified by riches, by glory and honour, by a kingdom, and by a paradise; and into this state the righteous may be said to enter immediately upon death, which is no other than stepping out of one world into another; and this they enter into as into a house, as it really is, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; and, entering into it, they take possession of it, and for ever enjoy it: <p>they shall rest in their beds, their souls in the bosom of Abraham, in the arms of Jesus; their bodies in the grave, which is a bed unto them, where they lie down and sleep, till they are awaked at the resurrection; and where they rest from all toil and labour, from all diseases and distempers, pains and tortures, and from all persecuting enemies; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, <p>each one walking in his uprightness; in the righteousness of Christ, and in the shining robes of immortality and glory, and in perfect purity and holiness: or, "before him" (e); before God, in the sight or presence of him, and by sight, and not by faith, as now. Though this is by some considered as the character of the righteous man in life, so Aben Ezra; and then the sense is, that he that walks in his uprightness, in the uprightness or righteousness of Christ, and by faith on him; that walks uprightly in his life and conversation before God, and "before himself"; following the rule before him, and walking according to the rule of the Gospel, and in the ordinances of it blameless, when he comes to die, he enters into peace and rest. And to this sense is the Targum, which paraphrases it, <p>"that are doers of his law;'' <p>see <a href="/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>.

Not merely into "stillness" or "silence" (<a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>), but into "peace," or, as the word might be rendered (Cheyne), "a state of peace." There is, no doubt, primarily, "<span class="accented">a</span> contrast to the awful troubles which the survivors will have to encounter" (Hengstenberg); but perhaps this contrast is not all that is meant. The "peace" is positive rather than negative, or it would scarcely be a consolation to any one. They shall rest in their beds; or, <span class="accented">upon their beds.</span> This expression seems to imply a consciousness of rest, and so a certain enjoyment of it. Each one walking in his uprightness; rather, <span class="accented">whosoever hath walked uprightly</span>, or <span class="accented">in a straight path</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>). The phrase is an equivalent for "the righteous" of ver. 1, and refers to the life on earth of those who have gone down into silence, not to their life after they have reached the silent shore. Of that life the evangelical prophet is not commissioned to give us any information. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/56.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The expression "saying of the Lord" (Ne'um Jehovah), which is so solemn an expression in itself, and which stands here at the head of the following declaration, is a proof that it contains not only something great, but something which needs a solemn confirmation because of its strangeness. Not only is there no ground for supposing that Gentiles who love Jehovah will be excluded from the congregation; but it is really Jehovah's intention to gather some out of the heathen, and add them to the assembled diaspora of Israel. "Word of the Lord, Jehovah: gathering the outcasts of Israel, I will also gather beyond itself to its gathered ones." We only find &#1492; &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; at the commencement of the sentence, in this passage and <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>. The double name of God, Adonai Jehovah, also indicates something great. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (to it) refers to Israel, and &#1500;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493; is an explanatory permutative, equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;; or else &#1506;&#1500; denotes the fact that the gathering will exceed the limits of Israel (cf., <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>), and &#1500; the addition that will be made to the gathered ones of Israel. The meaning in either case remains the same. Jehovah here declares what Jesus says in <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a> : "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd:" "Jehovah one, and His name one," as it is expressed in <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>. Such as the views and hopes that have grown up out of the chastisement inflicted by their captivity. God has made it a preparatory school for New Testament times. It has been made subservient to the bursting of the fetters of the law, the liberation of the spirit of the law, and the establishment of friendship between Israel and the Gentile world as called to one common salvation. </body></html>
