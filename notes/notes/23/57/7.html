When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon a lofty and high mountain - The design of this verse and the following, is, to show the extent, the prevalence, the publicity, and the grossness of their idolatry. The language is that which would appropriately express adulterous intercourse, and is designed to show the abhorrence in which God held their conduct. The language is easy to be understood, and it would not be proper to go into an extended explanation of the phrases used. It is common in the Scriptures to compare idolatry among the people of God, with unfaithfulness to the marriage vow. The declaration that they had placed their bed on a high mountain, means, that in the rites of idolatrous worship, there was no concealment. It was public and shameless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Temples and altars, which are usually built on high places, where they commit spiritual adultery; that is, idolatry, in imitation of the Heathens, who had their temples and altars on high places; and the idolatry of the church of Rome, in this context, is all along expressed in language agreeable to the Heathen idolatry, and in allusion to it. Some think this phrase denotes impudence in their idolatrous worship; for not content to worship under trees, in valleys, and under clifts of rocks, and such dark places; now, as not blushing at, or being ashamed of their actions, erect their altars in the most public places. Perhaps some reference may be had to the city of Rome itself, built on seven mountains, the seat of antichrist, and where the principal bed for idolatry is set up. The Targum is, <p>"on a high and lofty mountain thou hast the place of the house of thy dwelling;'' <p>which agrees very well with the great city, the seat of the beast. <p>Even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice; the sacrifice of the mass, to do which the idolaters go to their high places, their temples, and to their high altars, and especially in the great city. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/57.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> bed: even there thou wentest up to offer sacrifice.</span><p>(g) That is, your altars in an open place, like an impudent harlot, that cares not for the sight of her husband.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/57.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

"The righteous perisheth, and no man taketh it to heart; and pious men are swept away, without any one considering that the righteous is swept away from misfortune. He entereth into peace: they rest upon their beds, whoever has walked straight before him." With "the righteous" the prophet introduces, in glaring contrast to this luxurious living on the part of the leading men of the nation, the standing figure used to denote the fate of its best men. With this prevailing demoralization and worldliness, the righteous succumbs to the violence of both external and internal sufferings. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, he dies before his time (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>); from the midst of the men of his generation he is carried away from this world (<a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>), and no one lays it to heart, viz., the divine accusation and threat involved in this early death. Men of piety (chesed, the love of God and man) are swept away, without there being any one to understand or consider that (k&#305;&#772; unfolds the object to be considered and laid to heart, viz., what is involved in this carrying away when regarded as a providential event) the righteous is swept away "from the evil," i.e., that he may be saved from the approaching punishment (compare <a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>). For the prevailing corruption calls for punishment from God; and what is first of all to be expected is severe judgment, through which the coming salvation will force its way. In <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a> it is intimated that the righteous man and the pious do not lose the blessings of this salvation because they lose this life: for whereas, according to the prophet's watchword, there is no peace to the wicked, it is true, on the other hand, of the departing righteous man, that "he enters into peace" (sha&#770;lo&#772;m, acc. loci s. status; Ges. 118, 1); "they rest upon their beds," viz., the bottom of the grave, which has become their mishka&#770;b (<a href="/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>; <a href="/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>), "however has walked in that which lay straight before him," i.e., the one straight plain path which he had set before him (&#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493; acc. obj. as in <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/50-10.htm">Isaiah 50:10</a>, Ewald, 172, b, from &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;, that which lies straight before a person; whereas &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; with &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;, signifying probably fixedness, steadiness of look, related to Arab. nkh&#803;, to pierce, &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, percutere, is used as a preposition: compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a>, &#1500;&#1504;&#1499;&#1495;, straight or exactly before him). The grave, when compared with the restlessness of this life, is therefore "peace." He who has died in faith rests in God, to whom he has committed himself and entrusted his future. We have here the glimmering light of the New Testament consolation, that the death of the righteous is better than life in this world, because it is the entrance into peace. </body></html>
