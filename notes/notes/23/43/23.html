The Master tired not the servants with his commands, but they tired him with disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I, even I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encourages us to repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows the freeness of Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not for any thing in us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake; especially for his Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour. Would man justify himself before God? The attempt is desperate: our first father broke the covenant, and we all have copied his example. We have no reason to expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ; and that is always attended by true repentance, and followed by newness of life, by hatred of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him in remembrance of the promises he has made to the penitent, and the satisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him in wrestling for pardon; and declare these things, that thou mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it is a sure way to peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast not brought me - As a people you have withheld from me the sacrifices which were commanded. They had not maintained and observed his worship as he had required.<p>The small cattle - Margin, 'Lambs,' or 'kids.' The Hebrew word (&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;  s'eh) denotes properly one of a flock - a sheep or a goat. It should have been so rendered here. These animals were used for burnt-offerings, and the Jews were required to offer them daily to God.<p>Of thy burnt-offerings - (Compare <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>). The burnt-offering was wholly consumed on the altar.<p>With thy sacrifices - Bloody offerings. There is little difference between this word and that rendered 'burnt-offerings.' If there is any, it is that the word rendered 'sacrifice' (&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;  zebach) is of wider signification, and expresses sacrifice in general; the word rendered 'burnt-offering' (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;ola&#770;h), denotes that which is consumed, or which ascends as an offering. The holocaust refers to its being burned; the sacrifice to the offering, however made.<p>I have not caused thee to serve with an offering - 'I have not made a slave of thee; I have not exacted such a service as would be oppressive and intolerable - such as is imposed on a slave.' The word used here (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;  &#8219;a&#770;bad), is often used in such a sense, and with such a reference <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; 'Thou shalt not compel him to serve the service of a bondman' <a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>. The sense is, that the laws of God on the subject, were not grievous and oppressive.<p>With an offering - The word used here (&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h) denotes properly a bloodless oblation, and is thus distinguished from those mentioned before. It consisted of flour mingled with salt, oil, and incense; or of the fruits of the earth, etc. (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; compare <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>.<p>Nor wearied thee - By exacting incense.

The word &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;  lebo&#770;na&#770;h (Greek &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  libanos) denotes properly frankincense, a substance so called from its white color, from &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;  la&#772;ban, "to be white." It is found in Arabia <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>, and in Palestine Sol 4:6, Sol 4:14, and was obtained by making incisions in the bark of trees.

The kids and the lambs, which, according to the law, should have been brought for burnt offerings daily, morning and evening; and much less did they bring the larger cattle of burnt offerings, as oxen and bullocks. The Targum and Vulgate Latin render it, "the rams of thy burnt offerings"; the Septuagint version, "the sheep"; and the Syriac and Arabic versions, "the lambs"; and these were not brought to him, but to their idols; or, however, were not brought in a right way and manner, and from right principles, and with right views. Kimchi thinks this refers to the times of Ahaz, when the service of God ceased in the temple, and idolatry was practised at Jerusalem but it seems to respect later times, nearer the times of Christ; see <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>, <p>neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices; what sacrifices they did offer were not offered to God, but to their idols; or they were such as were not according to the law of God; or they were not offered up in the faith of the Messiah, nor with a true spirit of devotion, and with a sincere view to the glory of God, and in the exercise of repentance for sins; but rather as an atonement for them, and that they might go on in them with ease of mind; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, <p>I have not caused thee to serve with an offering; the "minchah", a meat offering or bread offering, which was a freewill offering, and they were not obliged to it; it was at their own option whether they would bring it or not, and which was not very chargeable to them: <p>nor wearied thee with incense; or frankincense, which was put upon the meat or bread offering; see <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>. Some understand this of all offerings in general, that they were not so many that were commanded them, as to be a burden to them; nor so expensive but that they were able to bear the charge of them, considering the fruitfulness of the land of Canaan, and especially the numerous and costly sacrifices of Heathen idolaters: and others think it has reference to the time of Israel's coming out of Egypt, and the covenant of God with them, when no mention was made of sacrifices, nor were they enjoined them, <a href="/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.

The absence of sacrifice has not impaired the bond between Jehovah and His people. The thought presents a striking contrast to ch. <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a> ff., a passage which was probably in the writer’s mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the small cattle</span>] The Heb. word serves as the noun of unity to the word for “flock” (i.e. sheep and goats).

The statement might no doubt be understood absolutely, according to <a href="/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21</a> ff.; but it is perhaps sufficient to take it of the Exile, when the non-essential character of sacrifice was revealed by its enforced discontinuance (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">incense</span>] See ch. <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>. In both these passages incense is described as coming from Arabia, which agrees with the statement of Pliny, that it was collected in the chief city of Hadramaut and thence conveyed to Syria. The Heb. word (<span class="ital">lěbônâh</span>), which is preserved in the Gr. <span class="greekheb">λίβανος</span>, <span class="greekheb">λιβανωτός</span>, is quite different from that found in ch. <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings</span>. If this reproach is regarded as addressed to <span class="accented">captive</span> Israel, who <span class="accented">could not</span> offer sacrifices, we must explain it by the analogy of the expression, "the calves of your lips" (<a href="/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>). All prayer may be regarded as a sort of offering, and withholding it as withholding sacrifice. But it is possible that the prophet is not addressing captive Israel only, but carrying his thoughts back to the period preceding the Captivity, when there was a general neglect of God's service, and for a time the temple was given up to idol-worship (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>). The glance back at earlier times is apparent in vers. 27, 28. <span class="cmt_word">I have not caused thee to serve with an offering</span>, etc.; rather, I <span class="accented">put no heavy service on thee in respect of meat offering</span>, <span class="accented">neither made I thee to toil in respect of incense</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my positive requirements have been light - surely thou shouldst have complied with them."

Incense was not required from any private person. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a second field of the picture of redemption; and the expression "for your sake" is expounded in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16-21</a> : "Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth a road through the sea, and a path through tumultuous waters; who bringeth out chariot and horse, army and hero; they lie down together, they never rise: they have flickered away, extinguished like a wick. Remember not things of olden time, nor meditate upon those of earlier times! Behold, I work out a new thing: will ye not live to see it? Yea, I make a road through the desert, and streams through solitudes. The beast of the field will praise me, wild dogs and ostriches: for I give water in the desert, streams in solitude, to give drink to my people, my chosen. The people that I formed for myself, they shall show forth my praise." What Jehovah really says commences in <a href="/isaiah/43-18.htm">Isaiah 43:18</a>. Then in between He is described as Redeemer out of Egypt; for the redemption out of Egypt was a type and pledge of the deliverance to be looked for out of Babylon. The participles must not be rendered qui dedit, eduxit; but from the mighty act of Jehovah in olden time general attributes are deduced: He who makes a road in the sea, as He once showed. The sea with the tumultuous waters is the Red Sea (<a href="/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>); &#8219;izzu&#772;z, which rhymes with va&#770;su&#772;s, is a concrete, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>, the army with the heroes at its head. The expression "bringeth out," etc., is not followed by "and suddenly destroys them," but we are transported at once into the very midst of the scenes of destruction. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; shows them to us entering upon the sleep of death, in which they lie without hope (<a href="/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). The close (kappishta&#770;h kha&#770;bhu&#772;) is iambic, as in <a href="/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>. The admonition in <a href="/isaiah/43-18.htm">Isaiah 43:18</a> does not commend utter forgetfulness and disregard (see <a href="/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>); but that henceforth they are to look forwards rather than backward. The new thing which Jehovah is in the process of working out eclipses the old, and deserves a more undivided and prolonged attention. Of this new thing it is affirmed, "even now it sprouts up;" whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>, even in the domain of the future, a distinction was drawn between "the former things" and "new things," and it could be affirmed of the latter that they were not yet sprouting up. In the passage before us the entire work of God in the new time is called cha&#774;da&#770;sha&#770;h (new), and is placed in contrast with the ri'sho&#772;no&#772;th, or occurrences of the olden time; so that as the first part of this new thing had already taken place (<a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>), and there was only the last part still to come, it might very well be affirmed of the latter, that it was even now sprouting up (not already, which &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; may indeed also mean, but as in <a href="/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>). In connection with this, &#1514;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; (a verbal form with the suffix, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>, with kametz in the syllable before the tone, as in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>, in pause) does not mean, "Will ye then not regard it," as Ewald, Umbreit, and others render it; but, "shall ye not, i.e., assuredly ye will, experience it." The substance of the cha&#774;da&#770;sha&#770;h (the new thing) is unfolded in <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>. It enfolds a rich fulness of wonders: &#1488;&#1507; affirming that, among other things, Jehovah will do this one very especially. He transforms the pathless, waterless desert, that His chosen one, the people of God, may be able to go through in safety, and without fainting. And the benefits of this miracle of divine grace reach the animal world as well, so that their joyful cries are an unconscious praise of Jehovah. (On the names of the animals, see Khler on <a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>.) In this we can recognise the prophet, who, as we have several times observed since chapter 11 (compare especially <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>), has not only a sympathizing heart for the woes of the human race, but also an open ear for the sighs of all creation. He knows that when the sufferings of the people of God shall be brought to an end, the sufferings of creation will also terminate; for humanity is the heart of the universe, and the people of God (understanding by this the people of God according to the Spirit) are the heart of humanity. In v. 21 the promise is brought to a general close: the people that (zu&#772; personal and relative, as in <a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>)<p>(Note: The pointing connects &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; with makkeph, so that the rendering would be, "The people there I have formed for myself;" but according to our view, &#1506;&#1501; should be accented with yethib, and zu&#772; with munach. In just the same way, zu&#772; is connected with the previous noun as a demonstrative, by means of makkeph, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>, <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>, and by means of a subsidiary accent in <a href="/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>. The idea which underlies <a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a> appears to be, "This is the retribution that we have met with from him."' But in none of these can we be bound by the punctuation.)<p>I have formed for myself will have richly to relate how I glorified myself in them. </body></html>
