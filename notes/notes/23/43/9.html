By some it is treated as a rare form of imperat., on the ground of two doubtful analogies (so R.V. marg., “Gather yourselves together &c.”). Others take it as a precative perf. (A.V. and R.V.) the existence of which in Heb. is also disputed (see Driver, <span class="ital">Tenses</span>, § 20). There seems, however, no reason why it should not be understood as a perf. in the ordinary sense: <span class="bld">All the nations are gathered together</span>. The assembling of the parties in the process naturally precedes the calling of witnesses; and this clause is descriptive of the scene presupposed by <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/43-8.htm" title="Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.">Isaiah 43:8</a></span>.

According to the former rendering, the contrast is between the solemn, serious <span class="accented">history</span> of early times in Genesis, and the grotesque and extravagant myths, in which the nations generally embodied their views of the primitive  ages. (For a specimen of the contrast, see 'Aids to Faith,' Essay 6. pp. 275, 276.) <span class="cmt_word">Let them bring forth their witnesses</span>.

If the former, the sense is, "And then let them (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the witnesses) give ear to the assertions made, and declare them true;" if the latter, we may render, with Dr. Kay, "Or, if they have no witnesses, let them listen to the sacred records, and confess them to be <span class="accented">the truth."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, k&#305;&#772; (for), with all that follows, assigns the reason for the encouraging "Fear not;" so here a second k&#305;&#772; introduces the reason for the promise which ensures them against the dangers arising from either water or fire. "For I Jehovah am thy God; (I) the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I give up Egypt as a ransom for thee, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead. Because thou art dear in my eyes, highly esteemed, and I loved thee; I give up men in thy stead, and peoples for thy life." Both "Jehovah" and "the Holy One of Israel" are in apposition to "I" ('a&#774;n&#305;&#772;), the force of which is continued in the second clause. The preterite na&#770;thatt&#305;&#772; (I have given), as the words "I will give" in <a href="/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a> clearly show, states a fact which as yet is only completed so far as the purpose is concerned. "A ransom:" ko&#772;pher (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) is literally the covering - the person making the payment. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; is the land of Mero, which is enclosed between the White and Blue Nile, the present Dr Sennr, district of Sennr (Sen-rti, i.e., island of Sen), or the ancient Meriotic priestly state settled about this enclosed land, probably included in the Mudrya (Egypt) of the Achaemenidian arrowheaded inscriptions; though it is uncertain whether the Kusiya (Heb. Ku&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m) mentioned there are the predatory tribe of archers called &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Strabo, xi. 13, 6), whose name has been preserved in the present Chuzistan, the eastern Ethiopians of the Greeks (as Lassen and Rawlinson suppose), or the African Ethiopians of the Bible, as Oppert imagines. The fact that Egypt was only conquered by Cambyses, and not by Cyrus, who merely planned it (Herod. i. 153), and to whom it is only attributed by a legend (Xen. Cyr. viii. 6, 20, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), does no violence to the truth of the promise. It is quite enough that Egypt and the neighbouring kingdoms were subjugated by the new imperial power of Persia, and that through that empire the Jewish people recovered their long-lost liberty. The free love of God was the reason for His treating Israel according to the principle laid down in <a href="/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>. &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not signify ex quo tempore here, but is equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>; for if it indicated the terminus a quo, it would be followed by a more distinct statement of the fact of their election. The personal pronoun "and I" (va'a&#774;n&#305;&#772;) is introduced in consequence of the change of persons. In the place of &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (perf. cons.), &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; commended itself, as the former had already been used in a somewhat different function. All that composed the chosen nation are here designated as "man" (a&#770;da&#770;m), because there was nothing in them but what was derived from Adam. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; has here a strictly substitutionary meaning throughout. </body></html>
