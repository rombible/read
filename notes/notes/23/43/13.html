That he is unchangeably the same - a doctrine which is, as it is here designed to be used, the only sure foundation for the security of his people - for who can trust a being who is fickle, changing, vacillating?<p>3.

The work of redemption is finished just according to the draught of it in his eternal mind; and when he works upon the heart of a sinner at conversion, whatever obstructions and difficulties are in the way, these are removed, and the work is begun, and carried on, and performed, until the day of Christ. The work of the Lord in his churches, and the setting up of his kingdom in the world, in a more visible and glorious manner, shall be done, and none will be able to hinder it: <p>who can turn it back? either his work, or his hand in working; his purposes cannot be disannulled; his power cannot be controlled; his work cannot be made void, or of no effect; he always succeeds, for he has no superior that can obstruct him. <p>(k)   "ex quo dies fuit", Gataker; "ex quo dies esse coepit", Vatablus; "inde a tempore diei", Piscator.

"Fear not; for I am with thee: I bring thy seed from the east, and from the west will I gather them; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth; everything that is called by my name, and I have created for my glory, that I have formed, yea finished!" The fact that Jehovah is with Israel will show itself in this, that He effects its complete restoration from all quarters of the heaven (compare the lands of the diaspora in all directions already mentioned by Isaiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>). Jehovah's command is issued to north and south to give up their unrighteous possession, not to keep it back, and to restore His sons and daughters (compare the similar change in the gender in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>), which evidently implies the help and escort of the exiles on the part of the heathen (<a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>). The four quarters and four winds are of the feminine gender. In <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a> the object is more precisely defined from the standpoint of sacred history. The three synonyms bring out the might, the freeness, and the riches of grace, with which Jehovah called Israel into existence, to glorify Himself in it, and that He might be glorified by it. They form a climax, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; signifies to produce as a new thing; &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, to shape what has been produced; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make it perfect or complete, hence creavi, formavi, perfeci. </body></html>
