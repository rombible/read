The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them.  What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Since thou wast precious in my sight - This verse contains another reason why God would defend and deliver them. That reason was, that he had loved them as his people; and he was willing, therefore, that other people should be overcome in order that they might be saved.<p>Thou hast been honorable - This does not refer so much to their personal character, as to the fact that they had been honored by him with being the depository of the precious truths of his religion. It means that he had made them honorable by the favors bestowed on them; not that they were honorable in reference to their own personal character and worth.<p>Therefore will I give men for thee - As in the case of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. He would cause other nations to be destroyed, if it were necessary, in order to effect their deliverance, and to restore them to their own land. We learn here:<p>1. That nations and armies are in the hand of God, and at his disposal.<p>2. That his people are dear to his heart, and that it is his purpose to defend them.<p>3. That the revolutions among nations, the rise of one empire, and the fall of another, are often in order to promote the welfare of his church, to defend it in danger, and deliver it in time of calamity.<p>4. That his people should put the utmost confidence in God as being able to defend them, and as having formed a purpose to preserve and save them.<p>Expressions similar to those used in this verse occur frequently among the Arabians (see Rosenmuller in loc).<p>For thy life - Margin, 'Person.'

Since&#8212;All along from the beginning; for there was never a time when Israel was not Jehovah's people. The apodosis should be at, "I will give." "Since ever thou wast precious in My sight, honorable, and that I loved thee, I will give," &c. [Maurer]. Gesenius, as English Version, takes "Since" to mean, "Inasmuch as." If the apodosis be as in English Version, "Since thou wast precious" will refer to the time when God called His people out of Egypt, manifesting then first the love which He had from everlasting towards them (Jer 31:3; Ho 11:1); "honorable" and "loved," refer to outward marks of honor and love from God.<p>men &#8230; people&#8212;other nations for thee (so Isa 43:3).<p>thy life&#8212;thy person.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee:</span> so the sense is, From that time that I chose time for my precious and peculiar treasure and people, I have had a great esteem and affection for thee.

As the saints are; not that they are valuable in themselves; they have no intrinsic worth in them; they are in no wise better than others; they are of the same mass and lump with others; they are of the fallen race of Adam, and are earthly and simple as he was; nor are they precious in their own sight, and much less in the eyes of the world; they are mean and despicable: but they are precious in the sight of God and Christ; in the sight of God the Father, who has chosen them, and taken them into his family, and blessed them with all spiritual blessings; and in the sight of Christ, who desired them, and betrothed them to himself, and undertook for them in eternity, and died for them in time; hence they are compared to things of value, to gold, to jewels, and precious stones, to a pearl of great price, to rich treasure; and are reckoned by Christ as his portion, and are as dear to him as the apple of his eye: <p>thou hast been honourable; ever since precious, and that was from all eternity; for though they became dishonourable in themselves, through the fall of Adam, and their own transgressions, and are dishonourable in the esteem of men, yet honourable in the esteem of God and Christ; they appear to be so, by their birth, by regeneration, being born of God; by their marriage to the Son of God, the Lord of the whole earth; by their characters of kings and priests unto God; and by their clothing, the robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation clothing of wrought gold; and by their being favoured with the presence of God and Christ, and their nearness to them: <p>and I have loved thee; which is the source and spring of all; hence they became precious and honourable; this is a past act, an act in eternity; it is an act of complacency and delight; a continued one, God rests in his love; and it is an act of undeserved grace and layout, and unchangeably the same; it never alters: <p>therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life: as, of old, the Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Sabeans, were given for the people of Israel, as in the preceding verse; so, in New Testament times, the enemies of God's people should be given for them; that is, their enemies should be destroyed, and they should be spared and saved; so that all Jews that rejected Christ, and persecuted his people, were given up to destruction. The Pagan empire was demolished, and so will Rome Papal too be destroyed, and the church of God will be preserved, and his interest revive, and all the kingdoms of the world become his; of which the conversions among the Gentiles in the first ages of Christianity were a pledge, prophesied of in the next words.

"Since" probably means "from the time that" (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), not "because," as Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render. Israel became "precious" from the time that the promise was given to Jacob that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>). Thenceforward God placed the interests of Israel above those of "men" generally, and markedly above those of any other "people." <span class="cmt_word">People</span>; rather, <span class="accented">peoples -</span> as Mizraim, Cush, Seba (ver. 3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they ceased to be deaf to this crying contradiction, they would recognise with penitence that it was but the merited punishment of God. "Who among you will give ear to this, attend, and hear afar off? Who has give up Jacob to plundering, and Israel to the spoilers? Is it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned? and they would not walk in His ways, and hearkened not to His law. Then He poured upon it in burning heat His wrath, and the strength of the fury of war: and this set it in flames round about, and it did not come to be recognised; it set it on fire, and it did not lay it to heart." The question in <a href="/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a> has not the force of a negative sentence, "No one does this," but of a wish, "O that one would" (as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; Ges. 136, 1). If they had but an inward ear for the contradiction which the state of Israel presented to its true calling, and the earlier manifestations of divine mercy, and would but give up their previous deafness for the time to come: this must lead to the knowledge and confession expressed in <a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>. The names Jacob and Israel here follow one another in the same order as in <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, where this would have been impracticable). &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; belongs to &#1500;&#1493; in the sense of cui. The punctuation does not acknowledge this relative use of &#1494;&#1493; (on which, see at <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a>), and therefore puts the athnach in the wrong place (see Rashi). In the words "we have sinned" the prophet identifies himself with the exiles, in whose sin he knew and felt that he was really involved (cf., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). The objective affirmation which follows applies to the former generations, who had sinned on till the measure became full. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498; takes the place of the object to &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (see <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>); the more usual expression would be &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;; the inverted order of the words makes the assertion all the more energetic. In <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a> the genitive relation &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is avoided, probably in favour of the similar ring of &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; is either the accusative of the object, and &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; a subordinate statement of what constituted the burning heat (cf., Ewald, 287, k), or else an accusative, of more precise definition  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a> (Ges. 118, 3). The outpouring is also connected by zeugma with the "violence of war." The milcha&#770;ma&#770;h then becomes the subject. The war-fury raged without result. Israel was not brought to reflection.  </body></html>
