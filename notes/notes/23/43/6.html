The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them.  What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will say to the north, Give up - Give up my people, or restore them to their own land.<p>Bring my sons ... - Bring all my people from the distant lands where they have been driven in their dispersion. This is a beautiful passage. As if all lands were under the control of God, and he could at once command and they would obey, he calls on them to yield up his people to their own country. He issues a commandment which is heard in all quarters of the globe, and the scattered people of God come flocking again to their own land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

That is, give up, and not retain, those that belong to the Lord; here the winds are spoken to by a personification; or the inhabitants of the northern and southern climates are called upon to deliver up the Lord's people to him, for whose sake the Gospel was sent into these parts, to find them out, and bring them home; by the "north" may be meant the Goths, Swedes, Muscovites, and those northern isles of ours, with others; and by the "south" the Egyptians, Africans, and Ethiopians. Manasseh ben Israel (h) thinks the passage is thus expressed, which he supposes refers to the universal gathering of the Jews in the latter day to the holy land; because Media, Persia, and China, lie to the east of it; Tartary and Scythia to the north; the kingdom of the Abyssines to the south; and Europe to the west: <p>bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; such whom the Lord had predestinated to the adoption of children, and had taken into his family, and whom he regenerated by his Spirit and grace, of either sex; to whom he beareth the strongest love and affection, as a parent to his children; and of whom he takes the utmost care, so that not one shall be lost; let them be in ever so distant a part of the world, he will send his Gospel to them, his ministers after them, and his Spirit shall accompany them, to bring them to himself, his Son, and his churches. Manasseh, before mentioned, understands this of America, and of the Jews there; but may be much better applied to converted Gentiles there; for God has many sons and daughters in those parts. <p>(h) Spes Israelis, sect. 24. p. 76. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">my sons … my daughters</span>] see ch. <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a>.

The nations are called upon, not merely to "let Israel go," but to conduct and escort them from the places of their abode to their own country. (On the need of such escort, see <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>. On the actual furnishing of an escort in one case by a Persian king, see <a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7, 8</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they ceased to be deaf to this crying contradiction, they would recognise with penitence that it was but the merited punishment of God. "Who among you will give ear to this, attend, and hear afar off? Who has give up Jacob to plundering, and Israel to the spoilers? Is it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned? and they would not walk in His ways, and hearkened not to His law. Then He poured upon it in burning heat His wrath, and the strength of the fury of war: and this set it in flames round about, and it did not come to be recognised; it set it on fire, and it did not lay it to heart." The question in <a href="/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a> has not the force of a negative sentence, "No one does this," but of a wish, "O that one would" (as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; Ges. 136, 1). If they had but an inward ear for the contradiction which the state of Israel presented to its true calling, and the earlier manifestations of divine mercy, and would but give up their previous deafness for the time to come: this must lead to the knowledge and confession expressed in <a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>. The names Jacob and Israel here follow one another in the same order as in <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, where this would have been impracticable). &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; belongs to &#1500;&#1493; in the sense of cui. The punctuation does not acknowledge this relative use of &#1494;&#1493; (on which, see at <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a>), and therefore puts the athnach in the wrong place (see Rashi). In the words "we have sinned" the prophet identifies himself with the exiles, in whose sin he knew and felt that he was really involved (cf., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). The objective affirmation which follows applies to the former generations, who had sinned on till the measure became full. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498; takes the place of the object to &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (see <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>); the more usual expression would be &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;; the inverted order of the words makes the assertion all the more energetic. In <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a> the genitive relation &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is avoided, probably in favour of the similar ring of &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; is either the accusative of the object, and &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; a subordinate statement of what constituted the burning heat (cf., Ewald, 287, k), or else an accusative, of more precise definition  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a> (Ges. 118, 3). The outpouring is also connected by zeugma with the "violence of war." The milcha&#770;ma&#770;h then becomes the subject. The war-fury raged without result. Israel was not brought to reflection.  </body></html>
