Who brought forth the chariots and horses, and the mighty army of Pharaoh, out of Egypt, to pursue the Israelites into the Red sea, where they were drowned. The present tense is put for the future, as in the preceding verse; the future is put for the past tense in the next clause: <p>they shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they lay down in the Red sea, where they sunk to the bottom, and perished, and never rose more, at least to life, nor never will, till the general resurrection: <p>they are extinct, they are quenched as tow; or flax, or as the wick of a candle (p), when put into water, is quenched at once; so the Egyptian, became extinct in the Red sea. Some observe an allusion to the commodity of flax, for which Egypt was famous. Kimchi interprets the whole of the army of Sennacherib, which was brought out of their own land to Jerusalem, and was destroyed in one night by an angel. Aben Ezra of the Chaldeans being brought out to fight with the Persians.

Still the reference is to the events of the Exodus, whereof Israel is reminded, since "the redemption out of Egypt was a type and pledge of the deliverance to be looked for out of Babylon" (Delitzsch). God then "brought out" after Israel, to attack him, "chariot and horse, army and power;" but the result was their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">They shall lie down...  they shall not rise</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they lie down</span>...  <span class="accented">they do not rise</span> (so Cheyne and Delitzsch).

The metaphor is not drawn from burning tow, which is not very readily extinguished, but from the wick of a lamp, which a single breath puts out. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The address now closes by holding up once more the object and warrant of faith. "I am Jehovah; and beside me there is no Savour. I have proclaimed and brought salvation, and given to perceive, and there was no other god among you: and ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God. Even from the day onwards I am so; and there is no deliverer out of my hand: I act, and who can turn it back?" The proper name "Jehovah" is used here (<a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>) as a name indicating essence: "I and no other am the absolutely existing and living One," i.e., He who proves His existence by His acts, and indeed by His saving acts. &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; and Jehovah are kindred epithets here; just as in the New Testament the name Jehovah sets, as it were, but only to rise again in the name Jesus, in which it is historically fulfilled. Jehovah's previous self-manifestation in history furnished a pledge of the coming redemption. The two synonyms &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; have &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in the midst. He proclaimed salvation, brought salvation, and in the new afflictions was still ever preaching salvation, without there having been any za&#770;r, i.e., any strange or other god in Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>; see above, <a href="/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>), who proved his existence in any such way, or, in fact, gave any sign of existence at all. This they must themselves confess; and therefore (Vav in sense equivalent to ergo, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>) He, and He alone, is El, the absolutely mighty One, i.e., God. And from this time forth He is so, i.e., He, and He only, displays divine nature and divine life. There is no reason for taking &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; in the sense of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "from the period when the day, i.e., time, existed" (as the lxx, Jerome, Stier, etc., render it). Both the gam (also) and the future 'eph&#8219;al (I will work) require the meaning supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>, "from the day onwards," i.e., from this time forth (syn. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>). The concluding words give them to understand, that the predicted salvation is coming in the way of judgment. Jehovah will go forward with His work; and if He who is the same yesterday and today sets this before Him, who can turn it back, so that it shall remain unaccomplished? The prophecy dies away, like the massa&#770;' Ba&#770;bhel with its epilogue in <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>. In the first half (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-17</a>) Jehovah introduced His servant, the medium of salvation, and proclaimed the approaching work of salvation, at which all the world had reason to rejoice. The second half (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-43:13</a>) began with reproaching, and sought to bring Israel through this predicted salvation to reflect upon itself, and also upon its God, the One God, to whom there was no equal. </body></html>
