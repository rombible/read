But God's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of his promise.

So Vitringa, Rosenmuller, Grotius, and others understand it. But Lowth, more correctly, regards it as referring to the Gentiles. It is designed as an argument to show the superiority of God over all idols, and to demonstrate that he was able to deliver his people from captivity and exile. He appeals, therefore <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>, to his own people in proof of his divinity and power. None of the pagan <a href="/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a> had been able to predict future events, none of the pagan gods, therefore, could save; but Yahweh, who had so often foretold events that were fulfilled, was able to deliver, and of that fact his own people had had abundant evidence.<p>That have eyes - They had natural faculties to see and know God (compare <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>), but they had not improved them, and they had, therefore, run into the sin and folly of idolatry. The phrase 'bring forth,' implies a solemn appeal made by God to them to enter into an argument on the subject (compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The Targum applies this to the bringing of the people of Israel out of Egypt; and others understand it of their deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; and some of the exclusion of them from the kingdom of heaven, and casting them into outward darkness, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>, but it is rather to be understood of the conviction of them; though better of the Gentiles, and of the enlightening of them, who before were blind; and causing them to hear, who before were deaf to spiritual things, agreeably to what goes before. It seems best to consider the words as a summons to the Heathens uncalled, to the Roman Pagan empire, to come forth and appear, who were as blind and deaf as the idols they worshipped, and plead their cause, agreeably to what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Bring forth</span>] i.e. not “from exile,” but “before the tribunal.” The sense demands an imperat., and the Heb. pointing (which gives a perf.) must be altered accordingly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a</span> <span class="ital">blind people that have eyes</span> …] “a people which is blind and yet has eyes &c.” This cannot mean “a people <span class="ital">once</span> blind and deaf, but <span class="ital">now</span> in possession of sight and hearing”; and it scarcely means anything so subtle as “a people which though blind and deaf yet possesses the organs of sight and hearing,” and therefore can be made to see and hear (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm" title="You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.">Isaiah 43:10</a></span>).

The nations are once more challenged (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1, 21-26</a>) to set forth the claims of their gods against those of Jehovah. Israel is summoned on the one hand (ver. 8); the nations on the other (ver. 9). What prophecy can the nations produce, either old or new? The Israelites can abundantly witness on behalf of Jehovah (ver. 10). Jehovah adds a further witness of himself (vers. 11-13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes</span>. A tribunal is supposed to have been prepared, before which the contending parties are summoned to appear and plead.

Next, the nations are summoned (see the following verse). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The tone of the address is now suddenly changed. The sudden leap from reproach to consolation was very significant. It gave them to understand, that no meritorious work of their own would come in between what Israel was and what it was to be, but that it was God's free grace which came to meet it. "But now thus saith Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel! Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by name, thou art mine. When thou goest through the water, I am with thee; and through rivers, they shall not drown thee: when thou goest into fire, thou shalt not be burned; and the flame shall not set thee on fire." The punishment has now lasted quite long enough; and, as &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; affirms, the love which has hitherto retreated behind the wrath returns to its own prerogatives again. He who created and formed Israel, by giving Abraham the son of the promise, and caused the seventy of Jacob's family to grow up into a nation in Egypt, He also will shelter and preserve it. He bids it be of good cheer; for their early history is a pledge of this. The perfects after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> stand out against the promising futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, as retrospective glances: the expression "I have redeemed thee" pointing back to Israel's redemption out of Egypt; "I have called thee by thy name" (lit. I have called with thy name, i.e., called it out), to its call to be the peculiar people of Jehovah, who therefore speaks of it in <a href="/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a> as "My called." This help of the God of Israel will also continue to arm it against the destructive power of the most hostile elements, and rescue it from the midst of the greatest dangers, from which there is apparently no escape (cf., <a href="/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17</a>, <a href="/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a>; and Ges. 103, 2). </body></html>
