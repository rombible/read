The report that his ministers made to him of the blasphemies and threatenings of Rabshakeh, the general of the Assyrian army: <p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; the one because of the blasphemies he heard; the other cause of the destruction he and his people were threatened with: <p>and went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray to him there: he could have prayed in his own house, but he chose rather to go to the house of God, not so much on account of the holiness of the place, but because there the Lord promised, and was used to hear the prayers of his people,  <p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>,30 as also because it was more public, and would be known to the people, and set them an example to follow him in. Trouble should not keep persons from, but bring them to, the house of God; here the Lord is to be inquired of, here he is to be found; and from hence he sends deliverance and salvation to his people. Nothing is more proper than prayer in times of affliction; it is no ways unbecoming nor lessening the greatest king on earth to lay aside his royal robes, to humble himself before God, in a time of distress, and pray unto him. Hezekiah does not sit down to consider Rabshakeh's speech, to take it in pieces, and give an answer to it, but he applies unto God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard <i>it</i>, that he <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</span><p>(a) In sign of grief and repentance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">went</span> into <span class="ital">the house of the Lord</span>] See <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/37-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD....">Isaiah 37:14-15</a></span>.

He did as they had done (<a href="/isaiah/36-22.htm">Isaiah 36:22</a>; see the comment on that verse). But he went further, showing a deeper sense of horror and affliction than the officials had shown by being covered with sackcloth (on the combination of the two modes of showing grief or horror, see <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.).

Hezekiah can, on this occasion, have gone up to the house of the Lord only to pray. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Rabshakeh had refused the request of Hezekiah's representatives in this contemptuous manner, he turned in defiance of them to the people themselves. "Then Rabshakeh went near, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language (K. and spake), and said, Hear the words (K. the word) of the great king, the king of Asshur. Thus saith the king, Let not Hizkiyahu practise deception upon you (&#1497;&#1505;&#1492;, K. &#1497;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;)); for he cannot deliver you (K. out of his hand). And let not Hizkiyahu feed you with hope in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will deliver, yea, deliver us: (K. and) this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Asshur. Hearken not to Hizkiyahu: for thus saith the king (hammelekh, K. melekh) of Asshur, Enter into a connection of mutual good wishes with me, and come out to me: and enjoy every one his vine, and every one his fig-tree, and drink every one the water of his cistern; till I come and take you away into a land like your land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread-corn and vineyards (K. a land full of fine olive-trees and honey, and live and do not die, and hearken not to Hizkiyahu); that Hizkiyahu to not befool you (K. for he befools you), saying, Jehovah will deliver us! Have the gods of the nations delivered (K. really delivered) every one his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvayim (K. adds, Hena&#8219; and &#8219;Ivah)? and how much less (&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;, K. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) have they delivered that Samaria out of my hand? Who were they among all the gods of these (K. of the) lands, who delivered their land out of my hand? how much less will Jehovah deliver Jerusalem out of my hand!? The chronicler also has this continuation of Rabshakeh's address in part (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-13.htm">2 Chronicles 32:13-15</a>), but he has fused into one the Assyrian self-praise uttered by Rabshakeh on his first and second mission. The encouragement of the people, by referring to the help of Jehovah (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6-8</a>), is placed by him before this first account is given by Isaiah, and forms a conclusion to the preparations for the contest with Asshur as there described. Rabshakeh now draws nearer to the wall, and harangues the people. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; is construed here with a dative (to excite treacherous hopes); whereas in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a> it is written with an accusative. The reading &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493; is altered from &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>, which is inserted still more frequently by the chronicler. The reading &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503; is incorrect; it would require &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503; (Ges. 143, 1a). To make a bera&#770;kha&#770;h with a person was equivalent to entering into a relation of blessing, i.e., into a state of mind in which each wished all prosperity to the other. This was probably a common phrase, though we only meet with it here. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, when applied to the besieged, is equivalent to surrendering (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>). If they did that, they should remain in quiet possession and enjoyment, until the Assyrian fetched them away (after the Egyptian campaign was over), and transported them to a land which he describes to them in the most enticing terms, in order to soften down the inevitable transportation. It is a question whether the expansion of this picture in the book of Kings is original or not; since &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506; in <a href="/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a> appears to be also tacked on here from <a href="/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a> (see at this passage). On Hamath and Arpad (to the north of Haleb in northern Syria, and a different place from Arvad  equals  Arad), see <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>. Sepharvayim (a dual form, the house of the Sepharv&#305;&#772;m, <a href="/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>) is the Sipphara of Ptol. v. 18, 7, the southernmost city of Mesopotamia, on the left bank of the Euphrates; Pliny's Hipparenum on the Narraga, i.e., the canal, nehar malka&#770;, the key to the irrigating or inundating works of Babylon, which were completed afterwards by Nebuchadnezzar (Plin. h. n. vi. 30); probably the same place as the sun-city, Sippara, in which Xisuthros concealed the sacred books before the great flood (see K. Mller's Fragmenta Historicorum Gr. ii.-501-2). &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a> has a warning meaning (as if it followed &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;   ); and both &#1493;&#1499;&#1497; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>, introduce an exclamatory clause when following a negative interrogatory sentence: and that they should have saved," or "that Jehovah should save," equivalent to "how much less have they saved, or will He save" (Ewald, 354, c; comp. &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a>). Rabshakeh's words in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a> are the same as those in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8-11</a>. The manner in which he defies the gods of the heathen, of Samaria, and last of all of Jerusalem, corresponds to the prophecy there. It is the prophet himself who acts as historian here, and describes the fulfilment of the prophecy, though without therefore doing violence to his character as a prophet. </body></html>
