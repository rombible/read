It is clear that Sennacherib on this occasion had marched by the usual coast route, through Sharon and the Shefeleh, upon Lachish, leaving Jerusalem far to his left. From Laehish he sent Rabshakeh to Hezekiah with a threatening message, and (as our version has it) "<span class="accented">with</span> a great army;" rather, "with a strong force." Rabshakeh, having delivered his message, returned to his master (<a href="/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>), doubtless with his escort. Sennacherib then sent a letter by messengers, but without an army, so far as we are told, to renew his threats. Meanwhile from Lachish he went to Libnah, after which we know nothing of his movements, unless we accept the Egyptian account, which was, that he advanced to Pelusium. The declaration, "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return" (comp. ver. 29) was the most comforting that Hezekiah could possibly receive. It assured him that he would not even be confronted with his enemy. Into this city; rather, <span class="accented">unto this city</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 32). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Asshur is Jehovah's chosen instrument while thus casting down the nations, which are "short-handed against him," i.e., incapable of resisting him. But Jehovah afterwards places this lion under firm restraint; and before it has reached the goal set before it, He leads it back into its own land, as if with a ring through its nostril. Fifth turn, "And thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy entering in, I know; and thy heating thyself against me. On account of thy heating thyself against me, and because thy self-confidence has risen up into mine ears, I put my ring into thy nose, and my muzzle into thy lips, and lead thee back by the way by which thou hast come." Sitting down and rising up (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>), going out and coming in (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>), denote every kind of human activity. All the thoughts and actions, the purposes and undertakings of Sennacherib, more especially with regard to the people of Jehovah, were under divine control. &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; is followed by the infinitive, which is then continued in the finite verb, just as in <a href="/isaiah/30-12.htm">Isaiah 30:12</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1498; (another reading, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1498;) is used as a substantive, and denotes the Assyrians' complacent and scornful self-confidence (<a href="/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>), and has nothing to do with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (Targum, Abulw., Rashi, Kimchi, Rosenmller, Luzzatto). The figure of the leading away with a nose-ring (chach&#305;&#772; with a latent dagesh, &#1495;&#1488; to prick, hence cho&#772;ach, Arab. cho&#772;ch, cho&#772;cha, a narrow slit, literally means a cut or aperture) is repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>. Like a wild beast that had been subdued by force, the Assyrian would have to return home, without having achieved his purpose with Judah (or with Egypt). </body></html>
