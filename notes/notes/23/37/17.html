The prayer which Hezekiah was now presenting to him, as also the reproach of the enemy: <p>open thine eyes, O Lord, and see; the letter he spread before him, and take notice of the blasphemies in it; and punish for them. Both these clauses are to be understood after the manner of men, and in a way becoming the being and perfections of God, to whom ears and eyes are not properly to be ascribed, and so likewise the bowing of the one, and the opening of the other; but both denote the gracious condescension of God, to take notice of things on earth, and vindicate the cause of his people, which is his own: <p>and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach the living God; the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, understand it of the words which Sennacherib sent in the letter to reproach the Lord; but in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-16.htm">2 Kings 19:16</a>, it is, "which hath sent him"; the messenger, Rabshakeh, or whoever was the person that brought the letter to Hezekiah. The Targum paraphrases the latter part thus, <p>"to reproach the people of the living God;'' <p>both God and his people were reproached, and both carry in them arguments with the Lord to hear and avenge himself and them; and the king prays that he would "hear", take notice of and observe all the words and give a proper answer, by inflicting just punishment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">open thine eyes … and see</span>] The Hebr. has “thine eye,” which is probably a better reading than “thine eyes” in <a href="/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.">2 Kings 19:16</a>.

"Thus shall ye say to Hizkiyahu king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Asshur. Behold, thou hast surely heard what (K. that which) the kings of Asshur have done to all lands, to lay the ban upon them; and thou, thou shouldst be delivered?! Have the gods of the nations, which my fathers destroyed, delivered them: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the Bene&#772;-&#8219;Eden, which are in Tellasar? Where is (K. where is he) the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of 'Ir-Sepharvaim, Hena', and 'Ivah?"Although &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is feminine, &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; (K. &#1488;&#1514;&#1501;), like &#1500;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501;, points back to the lands (in accordance with the want of any thoroughly developed distinction of the genders in Hebrew); likewise &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; quas pessumdederunt. There is historical importance in the fact, that here Sennacherib attributes to his fathers (Sargon and the previous kings of the Derketade dynasty which he had overthrown) what Rabshakeh on the occasion of the first mission had imputed to Sennacherib himself. On Gozan, see p. 33. It is no doubt identical with the Zuzan of the Arabian geographers, which is described as a district of outer Armenia, situated on the Chabur, e.g., in the Merasid. ("The Chabur is the Chabur of el-Hasaniye, a district of Mosul, to the east of the Tigris; it comes down from the mountains of the land of Zuzan, flows through a broad and thickly populated country in the north of Mosul, which is called outer Armenia, and empties itself into the Tigris." Ptolemy, on the other hand (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-18.htm">Isaiah 37:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a>), is acquainted with a Mesopotamian Gauzanitis; and, looking upon northern Mesopotamia as the border land of Armenia, he says, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (not far from Edessa) &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c6; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, possibly the district of Gulzan, in which Nisibin, the ancient Nisibis, still stands.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Expdition, i.60.)<p>For Hrn (Syr. Horon; Joseph. Charran of Mesopotamia), the present Harrn, not far from Charmelik, see Genesis, p. 327. The Harran in the Guta of Damascus (on the southern arm of the Harus), which Beke has recently identified with it, is not connected with it in any way. Retseph is the Rhesapha of Ptol. v. 18, 6, below Thapsacus, the present Rusafa in the Euphrates-valley of ez-Zor, between the Euphrates and Tadmur (Palmyra; see Robinson, Pal.). Telassar, with which the Targum (ii. iii.) and Syr. confound the Ellasar of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>, i.e., Artemita (Artamita), is not the Thelseae of the Itin. Antonini and of the Notitia dignitatum - in which case the Bene&#772;-&#8219;Eden might be the tribe of Bt Genn (Bettegene) on the southern slope of Lebanon (i.e., the 'Eden of Coelesyria, <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; the Paradeisos of Ptol. v. 15, 20; Paradisus, Plin. v. 19) - but the Thelser of the Tab. Peuting., on the eastern side of the Tigris; and Bene&#772;-&#8219;Eden is the tribe of the 'Eden mentioned by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>) after Haran and Ctesiphon. Consequently the enumeration of the warlike deeds describes a curve, which passes in a north-westerly direction through Hamath and Arpad, and then returns in Sepharvaim to the border of southern Mesopotamia and Babylonia. 'Ir-Sepharvaim is like 'Ir-Nchs, 'Ir-shemesh, etc. The legends connect the name with the sacred books. The form of the name is inexplicable; but the name itself probably signifies the double shore (after the Aramaean), as the city, which was the southernmost of the leading places of Mesopotamia, was situated on the Euphrates. The words &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506;, if not take as proper names, would signify, "he has taken away, and overthrown;" but in that case we should expect &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;. They are really the names of cities which it is no longer possible to trace. Hena' is hardly the well-known Avatho on the Euphrates, as Gesenius, V. Niebuhr, and others suppose; and 'Ivah, the seat of the Avv&#305;&#772;m (<a href="/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>), agrees still less, so far as the sound of the word is concerned, with "the province of Hebeh (? Hebeb: Ritter, Erdk. xi. 707), situated between Anah and the Chabur on the Euphrates," with which V. Niebuhr combines it.<p>(Note: For other combinations of equal value, see Oppert, Expdition, i. 220.) </body></html>
