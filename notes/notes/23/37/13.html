It was evidently in Mesopotamia, and was probably the same which was afterward called Ana, situated near a ford of the Euphrates. The situation of Ivah is not certainly known.

The same, as some think, with the gods or idols of those places; see Gill on <a href="/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; though it may be the princes that ruled over those cities are meant, who were either slain, or become tributary to the king of Assyria. It is added, <p>Henah and Ivah: which some take to be the names of the gods or kings of Sepharvaim; but rather, since Sepharvaim is of the dual number, it was a double city, the river Euphrates passing between them; and these, as Musculus conjectures, were the names of them; or it may be, these were distinct cities from that, but what or where they were is not certain. Ptolemy makes mention of a place called Ingine, near Gausanitis or Gozan, supposed to be Henah; though others rather think it to be Ange, which he places in Arabia (i), which I think is not so probable. Ivah perhaps is the same with Avah, in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>.

Behold, I will bring a spirit upon him, and he will hear a hearsay, and return to his land; and I cut him down with the sword in his own land."

The fact, so far as the style is concerned, is rather this, that <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>, while pointing back, gives the ground for <a href="/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a> : "and when they had come to him (saying this), he said to them." &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; we render "servants" (Knappen)<p>(Note: Knappe is the same word as "Knave;" but we have no word in use now which is an exact equivalent, and knave has entirely lost its original sense of servant. - Tr.)<p>after <a href="/esther/2-2.htm">Esther 2:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a>, <a href="/esther/6-5.htm">Esther 6:5</a>; it is a more contemptuous expression than &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;. The ru&#772;a&#774;ch mentioned here as sent by God is a superior force of a spiritual kind, which influences both thought and conduct, as in such other connections as <a href="/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a> (Psychol. p. 295, Anm.).<p>The external occasion which determined the return of Sennacherib, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>, was the fearful mortality that had taken place in his army. The shemu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h (rumour, hearsay), however, was not the tidings of this catastrophe, but, as the continuation of the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm">Isaiah 37:9</a>, clearly shows, the report of the advance of Tirhakah, which compelled Sennacherib to leave Palestine in consequence of this catastrophe. The prediction of his death is sufficiently special to be regarded by modern commentators, who will admit nothing but the most misty figures as prophecies, as a vaticinium post eventum. At the same time, the prediction of the event which would drive the Assyrian out of the land is intentionally couched in these general terms. The faith of the king, and of the inquirers generally, still needed to be tested and exercised. The time had not yet come for him to be rewarded by a clearer and fuller announcement of the judgment. </body></html>
