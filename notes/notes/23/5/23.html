Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which justify - This refers, doubtless, to magistrates.

It is remarkable, that this is introduced in immediate connection with their being mighty to mingle strong drink. One effect of intemperance is to make a man ready to be "bribed." Its effect is seen as clearly in courts of justice, and in the decisions of such courts, as any where. A man that is intemperate, or that indulges in strong drink, is not qualified to be a judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23.

There is no necessity to supply an object to the verb &#1493;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, as Knobel and others assume, viz., the waste lands mentioned in the second clause; nor is Ceda&#770;bra&#770;m to be taken as the object, as Caspari supposes; but the place referred to is determined by the context: in the place where Jerusalem is sunken, there lambs feed after the manner of their own pasture-ground, i.e., just as if they were in their old accustomed pasture (dober, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>, from da&#770;bar, to drive). The lambs intended are those of the ga&#770;rim mentioned in the second clause. The ga&#770;rim themselves are men leading an unsettled, nomad, or pilgrim life; as distinguished from ge&#770;rim, strangers visiting, or even settled at a place. The lxx have &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, so that they must have read either Ca&#770;rim or geda&#770;im, which Ewald, Knobel, and others adopt. But one feature of the prophecy, which is sustained by the historical fulfilment, is thereby obliterated. Cha&#770;rboth me&#770;chim are the lands of those that were formerly marrowy, i.e., fat and strutting about in their fulness; which lands had now become waste places. Knobel's statement, that a&#770;ca&#774;l is out of place in connection with ga&#770;rim, is overthrown by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>, to which he himself refers, though he makes he-goats the subject instead of men. The second woe closes with <a href="/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>. It is the longest of all. This also serves to confirm the fact that luxury was the leading vice of Judah in the time of Uzziah-Jotham, as it was that of Israel under Jeroboam II((see <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-14</a>, where the same threat is held out). </body></html>
