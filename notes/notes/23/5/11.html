Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wo unto them - The prophet, having denounced "avarice," proceeds now to another vice - that of "intemperance, or dissipation."<p>That rise up early ... - That rise "for this purpose," when nothing else would rouse them. It may illustrate this somewhat, to remark, that it was not common among the ancients to become intoxicated at an early hour of the day; see the note at <a href="/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>; compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>. It indicated then, as it does now, a confirmed and habitual state of intemperance when a man would do this early in the morning. 'The Persians, when they commit a debauch, arise betimes, and esteem the morning as the best time for beginning to drink wine, by which means they carry on their excess until night.' - "Morier."<p>That they may follow strong drink -  - &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;  she&#770;ka&#772;r, or sichar. This word is derived from a verb signifying to drink, to become intoxicated. All nations have found out some intoxicating drink. That which was used by the Hebrews was made from grain, fruit, honey, dates, etc., prepared by fermentation. The word sometimes means the same as wine <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>, but more commonly it refers to a stronger drink, and is distinguished from it, as in the common phrase, 'wine and strong drink;' <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/13-4.htm">Judges 13:4</a>, <a href="/judges/13-7.htm">Judges 13:7</a>. Sometimes it may be used for "spiced wine" - a mixture of wine with spices, that would also speedily produce intoxication. The Chaldee renders the words &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511; &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cha&#774;mar &#8219;at&#305;&#770;yq, 'old fermented liquor;' denoting the "mode" in which strong drink was usually prepared. It may be remarked here, that whatever may be the "form" in which intoxicating drink is prepared, it is substantially the same in all nations. Intoxication is caused by "alcohol," and that is produced by fermentation. It is never created or increased by distillation. The only effect of distillation is, to collect and preserve the alcohol which existed in the beer, the wine, or the cider. Consequently, the same substance produces intoxication when wine is drank, which does when brandy is drank; the same in cider or other fermented liquor, as in ardent spirits.<p>That continue until night - That drink all day. This shows that the "strong drink" intended here, did not produce "sudden," intoxication. This is an exact description of what occurs constantly in oriental nations. The custom of sitting long at the wine, when they have the means of indulgence, prevails everywhere. D'Ar-vieux says, that while he was staying among the Arabs on mount Carmel, a wreck took place on the coast, from which one of the emirs obtained two large casks of wine. He immediately sent to the neighboring emirs, inviting them to come and drink it. They gladly came, and continued drinking for two days and two nights, until not a drop of the wine was left. In like manner, Tavernier relates that the king of Persia sent for him early one morning to the palace, when, with other persons, he was obliged to sit all the day, and late at night, drinking wine with the shah; but at last, 'the king growing sleepy, gave us leave to depart, which we did very willingly, having had hard labor for seventeen hours together.'<p>Inflame them - Excite them; or stimulate them. We have the same phrase - denoting the "burning" tendency of strong drink. The American Indians appropriately call "fire-water." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

We have here <span class="accented">the second woe</span>. It is pronounced on drunkenness and revelry. Drunkenness is an infrequent Oriental vice; but it seems to have been one whereto many among the Jews were at all times prone (see <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-32</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, etc.). Even the priests and the <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> prophets erred through strong drink and were swallowed up of wine" (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That rise up early in the morning.</span> Great banquets were held by the "princes" and "nobles," beginning at an early hour (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>), and accompanied by music of an exciting kind (<a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5, 6</a>), which were "<span class="accented">continued</span> until <span class="accented">night</span>," or rather, "into the night" (Revised Version), and terminated in general drunkenness, perhaps in general licentiousness.

Two kinds of intoxicating liquor seem to have been consumed at these banquets, viz. ordinary grape wine, and a much stronger drink, which is said to have been "made of dates, pomegranates, apples, honey, barley, and other ingredients," which was known as <span class="accented">shekar</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and is called "strong drink" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Till wine inflame them</span>; or, <span class="accented">the wine inflaming them</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Now then, I will tell you what I will do at once to my vineyard: take away its hedge, and it shall be for grazing; pull down its wall, and it shall be for treading down." Before "now then" (vatta&#770;h) we must imagine a pause, as in <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>. The Lord of the vineyard breaks the silence of the umpires, which indicates their consciousness of guilt. They shall hear from Him what He will do at once to His vineyard (Lamed in l'carmi, as, for example, in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>). "I will do:" ani 'o&#772;eh, fut. instans, equivalent to facturus sum (Ges. 134, 2, b). In the inf. abs. which follow He opens up what He will do. On this explanatory use of the inf. abs., see <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. In such cases as these it takes the place of the object, as in other cases of the subject, but always in an abrupt manner (Ges. 131, 1). He would take away the mesucah, i.e., the green thorny hedge (<a href="/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>) with which the vineyard was enclosed, and would pull down the ga&#770;re&#772;d, i.e., the low stone wall (<a href="/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>), which had been surrounded by the hedge of thorn-bushes to make a better defence, as well as for the protection of the wall itself, more especially against being undermined; so that the vineyard would be given up to grazing and treading down (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;'&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), i.e., would become an open way and gathering-place for man and beast. </body></html>
