Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose arrows are sharp - Bows and arrows were the common instruments of fighting at a distance.

From the king in his chariot to the light-armed recruit just pressed into the service, all fight mainly with this weapon, more particularly in the earlier times (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 414, 423, 424-437, etc.).

The king always went to battle in a chariot. For the comparison of the rush of chariot-wheels to a whirlwind, see below, <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; and comp. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sixth woe: "Woe to those who are heroes to drink wine, and brave men to mix strong drink; who acquit criminals for a bribe, and take away from every one the righteousness of the righteous." We see from <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a> that the drinkers in <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a> are unjust judges. The threat denounced against these is Isaiah's universal ceterum censeo; and accordingly it forms, in this instance also, the substance of his sixth and last woe. They are heroes; not, however, in avenging wrong, but in drinking wine; they are men of renown, though not for deciding between guilt and innocence, but for mixing up the ingredients of strong artistic wines. For the terms applied to such mixed wines, see <a href="/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-30.htm">Proverbs 23:30</a>, Sol 7:3. It must be borne in mind, however, that what is here called sheca&#770;r was not, properly speaking, wine, but an artificial mixture, like date wine and cider. For such things as these they were noteworthy and strong; whereas they judged unjustly, and took bribes that they might consume the reward of their injustice in drink and debauchery (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7-8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-5.htm">Proverbs 31:5</a>). "For reward:" e&#772;keb (Arab. &#8219;ukb; different from a&#770;ke&#772;b, a heel,  equals  &#8219;akib) is an adverbial accusative, "in recompense," or "for pay." "From him" (mimmennu) is distributive, and refers back to tsaddikim (the righteous); as, for example, in <a href="/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>. </body></html>
