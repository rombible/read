The care of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by the management of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicest vines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances. The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He set up his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the means of grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoy privileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but not enough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, words and actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work, corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. They shall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go without check or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grown over with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spirit from those who have long striven against him, and the removal of his gospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. The explanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of the grapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of the world, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing and swearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end we may obtain everlasting life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now ... - This is an appeal which God makes to the Jews themselves, in regard to the justice and propriety of what he was about to do. A similar appeal he makes in <a href="/micah/6-3.htm">Micah 6:3</a> : 'O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against me.' He intended to "punish" them <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5-6</a>, and he appeals to them for the justice of it. He would do to them as they would do to a vineyard that had been carefully prepared and guarded, and which yet was valueless. A similar appeal he makes in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; and our Saviour made an application remarkably similar in his parable of the vineyard, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-40.htm">Matthew 21:40-43</a>. It is not improbable that he had his eye on this very place in Isaiah; and it is, therefore, the more remarkable that the Jews did not understand the bearing of his discourse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. And now, &c.&#8212;appeal of God to themselves, as in Isa 1:18; Mic 6:3. So Jesus Christ, in Mt 21:40, 41, alluding in the very form of expression to this, makes them pass sentence on themselves. God condemns sinners "out of their own mouth" (De 32:6; Job 15:6; Lu 19:22; Ro 3:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I dare make you judges in your own cause, it is so plain and reasonable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,....

As if the story told in the parable had been a fact, he calls on the men of Judah and Jerusalem to "judge between him and his vineyard." Compare Nathan's appeal to David by the parable of the ewe lamb (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it will come to pass, whoever is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem, holy will he be called, all who are written down for life in Jerusalem." The leading emphasis of the whole v. rests upon kadosh (holy). Whereas formerly in Jerusalem persons had been distinguished according to their rank and condition, without any regard to their moral worth (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10-11</a>; cf., <a href="/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>); so the name kadosh (holy) would now be the one chief name of honour, and would be given to every individual, inasmuch as the national calling of Israel would now be realized in the persons of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, etc.). Consequently the expression "he shall be called" is not exactly equivalent to "he shall be," but rather presupposes the latter, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>. The term kadosh denotes that which is withdrawn from the world, or separated from it. The church of the saints or holy ones, which now inhabits Jerusalem, is what has been left from the smelting; and their holiness is the result of washing. &#1492;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; is interchanged with &#1504;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;. The latter, as Papenheim has shown in his Hebrew synonyms, involves the idea of intention, viz., "that which has been left behind;" the former merely expresses the fact, viz., that which remains. The character of this "remnant of grace," and the number of members of which it would consist, are shown in the apposition contained in <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>. This apposition means something more than those who are entered as living in Jerusalem, i.e., the population of Jerusalem as entered in the city register (Hofmann); for the verb with Lamed does not mean merely to enter as a certain thing, but (like the same verb with the accusative in <a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>) to enter as intended for a certain purpose. The expression &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; may either be taken as a noun, viz., "to life" (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), or as an adjective, "to the living" (a meaning which is quite as tenable; cf., <a href="/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>). In either case the notion of predestination is implied, and the assumption of the existence of a divine "book of life" (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; cf., <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>); so that the idea is the same as that of <a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a> : "As many as were ordained to eternal life." The reference here is to persons who were entered in the book of God, on account of the good kernel of faith within them, as those who should become partakers of the life in the new Jerusalem, and should therefore be spared in the midst of the judgment of sifting in accordance with this divine purpose of grace. For it was only through the judgment setting this kernel of faith at liberty, that such a holy community as is described in the protasis which comes afterwards, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6-7</a>, could possibly arise. </body></html>
