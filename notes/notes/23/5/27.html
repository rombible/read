Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>None shall be weary - In this verse and the following, the prophet describes the condition of the army that would be summoned to the destruction of Judea. It would be composed of bold, vigorous, courageous men; they would be unwearied by long and painful journies; they would be fierce and violent; they would come fully prepared for conquest. None would be "weary," that is, fatigued with long marches, or with hard service; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-14.htm">2 Samuel 16:14</a>.<p>Nor stumble - They shall be chosen, select men; not those who are defective, or who shall easily fall by any impediments in the way of their march.<p>None shall slumber - They shall be unwearied, and indefatigable, pursuing their purpose with ever watchfull vigilance - so much as not to be off their guard. They cannot be taken by surprise.<p>Neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed - The ancients wore a loose, large, flowing robe, or upper garment. When they labored, or ran, it was necessary to "gird" this up round the body, or to lay it aside altogether. The form of expression here may mean, that they will not relax their efforts; they will not unloose their girdle; they will not unfit themselves for vigorous action, and for battle. "In" that girdle, with which they bound up their robes, the orientals usually carried their dirks and swords; see <a href="/nehemiah/4-18.htm">Nehemiah 4:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>. It means that they should be fully, and at all times, prepared for action.<p>Nor the latchet of their shoes be broken - They will be constantly prepared for marches. The shoes, sandals, or "soles" were attached to the feet, not by upper leather, but were girded on by thongs or strings; see the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. weary&#8212;with long marches (De 25:18).<p>none &#8230; slumber&#8212;requiring no rest.<p>girdle&#8212;with which the ancient loose robes used to be girded for action.

The third woe had reference to the unbelieving naturalists, the opponents of prophecy (nebua&#770;h); the fourth to the moralists, who threw all into confusion; and to this there is appended, by a very natural association of ideas, the woe denounced upon those whom want of humility rendered inaccessible to that wisdom which went hand in hand with prophecy, and the true foundation of which was the fear of Jehovah (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>). "Be not wise in thine own eyes," is a fundamental rule of this wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>). It was upon this wisdom that that prophetic policy rested, whose warnings, as we read in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9-10</a>, they so scornfully rejected. The next woe, which has reference to the administration of justice in the state, shows very clearly that in this woe the prophet had more especially the want of theocratic wisdom in relation to the affairs of state in his mind. </body></html>
