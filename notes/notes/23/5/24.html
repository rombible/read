Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore as the fire ... - The remainder of this chapter is occupied with predicting "judgments," or punishments, upon the people for their sins which had been specified. The Hebrew here is, 'The tongue of fire.' The figure is beautiful and obvious. It is derived from the pyramidal, or tongue-like appearance of "flame." The concinnity of the metaphor in the Hebrew is kept up. The word "devoureth" is in the Hebrew "eateth:" 'As the tongue of fire eats up,' etc. The use of the word "tongue" to denote "flame" is common in the Scriptures; see the note at <a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>.<p>And the flame consumeth the chaff - The word rendered "chaff here," means rather "hay, or dried grass." The word rendered 'consumeth,' denotes properly "to make to fall," and refers to the appearance when a fire passes through a field of grain or grass, consuming the stalks near the ground, so that the upper portion "falls down," or sinks gently into the flames.<p>So their root shall be as rottenness - Be rotten; or decayed - of course furnishing no moisture, or suitable juices for the support of the plant. The idea is, that all the sources of national prosperity among the Jews would be destroyed. The word "root" is often used to denote the source of "strength or prosperity;" <a href="/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>; <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>.<p>And their blossom - This word rather means germ, or tender branch. It also means the flower. The figure is kept up here. As the root would be destroyed, so would all that was supported by it, and all that was deemed beautiful, or ornamental.<p>As dust - The Hebrew denotes "fine dust," such as is easily blown about. The root would be rotten; and the flower, lacking nourishment, would become dry, and turn to dust, and blow away. Their strength, and the sources of their prosperity would be destroyed; and all their splendor and beauty, all that was ornamental, and the source of national wealth, would be destroyed with it.<p>They have cast away - They have refused to "obey" it. This was the cause of all the calamities that would come upon them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or "combination of two figures," the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. <span class="cmt_word">As the fire devoureth the stubble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a tongue of fire eats up stubble</span>. "<span class="accented">Tongue</span> of fire" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in <a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>. But it well depicts the power of fire to lick up clean all that comes in its way. Isaiah elsewhere notes the analogy, making it the foundation of simile (<a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the flame consumeth the chaff</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and as dry grass sinks down inflame</span>.

The root is the last thing to decay. When that fails, the case is desperate. Judah's "root" did not utterly fail (see <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>); but the present warning is to individuals and classes (vers. 8, 11, 18, 20-23), not to the nation. <span class="cmt_word">Their blossom shall go up as dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their external glory shall crumble and waste away. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have cast away the Law.</span> All the sins of Israel had this one thing in common - they were transgressions of the Law of God as delivered to them by Moses, and enforced upon them by the prophetical order (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Despised the word</span>; or, <span class="accented">the speech</span>. <span class="accented">Imrah</span> is rarely used by Isaiah. It does not refer to the written "Word," but to the declarations of God by the mouth of his prophets (see <a href="/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third woe is directed against the supposed strong-minded men, who called down the judgment of God by presumptuous sins and wicked words. "Woe unto them that draw crime with cords of lying, and sin as with the rope of the waggon." Knobel and most other commentators take ma&#770;shak in the sense of attrahere (to draw towards one's self): "They draw towards them sinful deeds with cords of lying palliation, and the cart-rope of the most daring presumption;" and cite, as parallel examples, <a href="/job/40-24.htm">Job 40:24</a> and <a href="/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>. But as ma&#770;shak is also used in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a> in the sense of drawing in a yoke, that is to say, drawing a plough or chariot; and as the waggon or cart (aga&#770;la&#770;h, the word commonly used for a transport-waggon, as distinguished from merca&#770;ba&#770;h, the state carriage or war chariot is expressly mentioned here, the figure employed is certainly the same as that which underlies the New Testament &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; ("unequally yoked," <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Iniquity was the burden which they drew after them with cords of lying (sha&#770;v'h : see at <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a> and <a href="/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>), i.e., "want of character or religion;" and sin was the waggon to which they were harnessed as if with a thick cart-rope (Hofmann, Drechsler, and Caspari; see Ewald, 221, a). Iniquity and sin are mentioned here as carrying with them their own punishment. The definite &#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (crime or misdeed) is generic, and the indefinite &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; qualitative and massive. There is a bitter sarcasm involved in the bold figure employed. They were proud of their unbelief; but this unbelief was like a halter with which, like beasts of burden, they were harnessed to sin, and therefore to the punishment of sin, which they went on drawing further and further, in utter ignorance of the waggon behind them. </body></html>
