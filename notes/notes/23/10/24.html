Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore ... - In this verse the prophet returns to the main subject of this prophecy, which is to comfort the people of Jerusalem with the assurance that the army of the Assyrian would be destroyed.<p>O my people - An expression of tenderness, showing that God regarded them as his children, and notwithstanding the judgments that he would bring upon them for their sins In the midst of severe judgments, God speaks the language of tenderness; and, even when he punishes, has toward his people the feelings of a father; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>.<p>That dwelleth in Zion - literally, in mount Zion; but here taken for the whole city of Jerusalem; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>.<p>Be not afraid ... - For his course shall be arrested, and he shall be repelled and punished; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25-27</a>.<p>He shall smite thee - He shall, indeed, smite thee, but shall not utterly destroy thee.<p>And shall lift up his staff - Note, <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>.

Some interpreters have supposed that this means that Sennacherib would oppress and afflict the Jews in his going down to Egypt, or on his way there to attack the Egyptians. But the more correct interpretation is that which is expressed in our translation - "after the manner of Egypt." That is, the nature of his oppressions shall be like those which the Egyptians under Pharaoh inflicted on the Jews. There are "two" ideas evidently implied here.<p>(1) That the oppression would be heavy and severe. Those which their fathers experienced in Egypt were exceedingly burdensome and cruel. So it would be in the calamities that the Assyrian would bring upon them. But,<p>(2) Their fathers had been delivered from the oppressions of the Egyptians. And so it would be now. The Assyrian would oppress them; but God would deliver and save them. The phrase, 'in the way of,' is used to denote "after the manner of," or, as an example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>, 'I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt;' Hebrew, 'In the way of Egypt;' compare <a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The closest rendering is that of the margin of R.V.: <span class="bld">and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness</span>. This has usually been interpreted to mean that the animal (Judah) will “wax fat and kick” (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>) and break its yoke; or that its increasing fatness will burst the yoke on its neck (a very odd comparison!). Neither of these senses is at all tolerable; according to Isaiah’s teaching the prosperity of the nation only commences after Jehovah has destroyed the Assyrian yoke. Dillmann’s interpretation—Judah will become so vigorous after its emancipation that no one will ever think of putting it under the yoke again—is equally unsatisfying. The text is almost certainly corrupt, and of the various emendations that have been proposed the most plausible are those which find in the clause a mutilated introduction to <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:...">Isaiah 10:28-32</a></span>. Prof. Robertson Smith has suggested instead of the last four words: <span class="greekheb">יחרל ׃עלה מצפון שרד</span>. The twenty-seventh verse would end with the first word (“the yoke <span class="ital">shall cease</span> from off thy neck”), and the next would begin thus: “A destroyer comes up from the north; he comes to Aiath, &c.” The alterations are considerable, but undoubtedly we thus obtain a suitable commencement to the sketch of the Assyrian advance. Duhm follows on the same lines, but reads, “he comes up from Pene-Rimmon” (i.e. the Rock Rimmon, a few miles north of Aiath, <a href="/judges/20-45.htm" title="And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.">Jdg 20:45</a>).

The verses are not to be taken as a prediction that the enemy will actually come by this route, still less of course are they an <span class="ital">oraculum post eventum</span>. They simply present a graphic picture of the unresting energy and eagerness of an Assyrian army, and the ease with which it might invade Judah from the north now that Samaria has fallen. And this is done in order to introduce the assurance that when the invader does come, and the prize is just within his grasp, Jehovah will smite him down (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.">Isaiah 10:33</a></span> ff.). A passage of very similar character is <a href="/context/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust....">Micah 1:10-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The strategic point in the itinerary here sketched is the Pass of Michmash, the scene of Jonathan’s famous exploit against the Philistines (1 Samuel 14), and at this time probably marking the northern frontier of the kingdom of Judah. It is situated in the modern Wadi Suweinît, and is guarded by the villages of Michmash on the north and Geba on the south. The road from Michmash crosses the valley in a south-westerly direction, and about midway between Michmash and Geba (the whole distance is about two miles) traverses an extremely narrow defile, where a large army might easily be checked by a handful of resolute defenders, In <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28</a></span> f.

Most other commentators, however, hold that some place, not to be certainly identified, between Ai and Michmash is intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">laid up his carriages</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">layeth up his baggage</span>, deposits his <span class="ital">impedimenta</span>. “Carriages” in old English means of course not that in which one is carried, but that which one carries (cf. <a href="/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled."><span class="bld">Isaiah 10:29</a>.

The latter clause might also be translated as the eager cry of the Assyrians: “Geba is our night quarters.” From this point the road to Jerusalem lies open; hence the remaining verses simply describe the terror spread amongst the villages along the route of the Assyrians. <span class="ital">Ramah</span> (<span class="ital">Er-Râm</span>) is less than two miles due west of Geba, <span class="ital">Gibeah of Saul</span> is probably <span class="ital">Tulêl el-Fûl</span>, about halfway between that place and Jerusalem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my people... be not afraid</span>.

The yoke of Assyria was heavy even upon the nations that submitted to her. She claimed to march her armies through their territories at her pleasure, and probably pressed men and cattle into her service. She exacted a heavy tribute, and otherwise "distressed" her many vassals. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the glory of his forest and his garden-ground will He destroy, even to soul and flesh, so that it is as when a sick man dieth. And the remnant of the trees of his forest can be numbered, and a boy could write them." The army of Asshur, composed as it was of many and various nations, was a forest (ya&#8219;ar); and, boasting as it did of the beauty of both men and armour, a garden ground (carmel), a human forest and park. Hence the idea of "utterly" is expressed in the proverbial "even to soul and flesh," which furnishes the occasion for a leap to the figure of the wasting away of a &#1504;&#1505;&#1505; (hap. leg. the consumptive man, from na&#770;sas, related to nu&#772;sh, 'a&#770;nash, Syr. n&#8219;s&#305;&#772;so, n&#8219;shisho, a sick man, based upon the radical notion of melting away, cf., ma&#770;sas, or of reeling to and fro, cf., mu&#772;t, nu&#772;t, Arab. na&#770;sa, na&#770;ta). Only a single vital spark would still glimmer in the gigantic and splendid colossus, and with this its life would threaten to become entirely extinct. Or, what is the same thing, only a few trees of the forest, such as could be easily numbered (mispa&#770;r as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>), would still remain, yea, so few, that a boy would be able to count and enter them. And this really came to pass. Only a small remnant of the army that marched against Jerusalem ever escaped. With this small remnant of an all-destroying power the prophet now contrasts the remnant of Israel, which is the seed of a new power that is about to arise. </body></html>
