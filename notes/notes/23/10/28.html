That such an invasion took place at or about the time of that king’s attack on Ashdod (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>) the inscriptions leave no doubt. The Koujunyik cylinder names the king of Judah as having joined with the king of Ashdod; and in another, Sargon speaks of himself as “the subduer of the lands of Judah” (Layard, <span class= "ital">Inscriptions, </span>xxxiii. 8). There is nothing in the passage itself to determine whether <a href="/context/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28-32</a> are predictive or historical, or when they were first uttered. Assuming that the Messianic prophecy of chap 11 is in close connection with them, it seems most probable that now, as in the earlier attack of Pekah and Rezin (Isaiah 7), as in the later invasion of Sennacherib (Isaiah 37), the bright vision of the future came to sustain the people when they were at their lowest point of depression. This would obviously be when Sargon’s armies were actually encamped round the city, when they had reached the last halting-place of the itinerary which Isaiah traces out. We may infer accordingly that the Assyrian armies were then at or near Nob, and that the prophet, supplied, either by human agency or supernaturally, with a knowledge of the movements of the Assyrian armies, describes their progress to a terrified and expectant people, and fixes the final goal. That progress we now have to trace. (1) Aiath is probably identical with the Ai of <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2</a>, the Aija of <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm" title="The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelled at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Bethel. (2) Migron. The route taken was not the usual one, but passed over three valleys, probably with a view to surprise Jerusalem by an unexpected attack. The modern name, <span class= "ital">Bure Magrun, </span>survives, a short distance from Bethel. (3) Michmash. Now <span class= "ital">Muchmas, </span>on the east side of the Migron valley. Here the carriages, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">baggage </span>(<a href="/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>), the <span class= "ital">impedimenta, </span>of the Assyrian army was left behind that the host might advance with greater rapidity to immediate action. (4) Geba, in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>). Here, after defiling through the “passages,” probably the gorge of <span class= "ital">Wady Suweinit </span>memorable for Jonathan s adventure (<a href="/context/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4-5</a>), the army halted and encamped. (5) The panic spread rapidly to Ramah, memorable as the chief residence of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:17</a>). (6) The inhabitants of Gibeah, still retaining in its name its old association with the hero-king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm" title="Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.">1Samuel 11:4</a>), left their town deserted and undefended. (7) Gallim, not now identifiable, but mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a>. (8) Laieh, not the northern city of that name (<a href="/judges/18-29.htm" title="And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.">Judges 18:29</a>), but near Jerusalem. Read, <span class= "ital">Listen, O Laish, </span>as if to the tramp of the armies as they passed. (9) Anathoth; about four miles north of Jerusalem, the birth-place of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). There is a special pathos in the prophet’s accents, a<span class= "ital">nîyah Anathôth. </span>A various reading adopted by many critics gives, <span class= "ital">Answer, O Anathoth. </span>(10) Madmenah, or Madmen, appears in <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, as a Moabite city. The name (“dung-hill”) was, however, not an uncommon one. It is named (<a href="/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>) as one of the south-eastern cities of Judah. (11) The people of Gebim (“water-pits;” locality not identified) <span class= "ital">gather their goods for flight. </span>(12) At last the army reaches Nob, memorable as having been one of the resting-places of the Tabernacle in the time of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?">1Samuel 21:1</a>). The site has not been identified with certainty, but it was obviously a position that commanded Jerusalem, between it and Anathoth, probably not far from the hill <span class= "ital">Scopos </span>(“watch-tower”) where Titus and his troops encamped during the siege of Jerusalem. The prophet’s narrative leaves the invader there shaking his hand, as with defiant menace, against the holy city.

This is the fifth part of the prophet’s discourse, in which we have, 1st, the expedition of the Assyrian monarch, described in the most lively manner in these verses; and, 2d, the unhappy success of that expedition, with its consequences, <a href="/context/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled....">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>.

Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He is come to Aiath - These verses <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a> contain a description of the march of the army of Sennacherib as he approached Jerusalem to invest it. The description is expressed with great beauty. It is rapid and hurried, and is such as one would give who was alarmed by the sudden and near approach of an enemy - as if while the narrator was stating that the invader had arrived at one place, he had already come to another; or, as if while one messenger should say, that he had come to one place, another should answer that he was still nearer, and a third, that he was nearer still, so as to produce universal consternation. The prophet speaks of this as if he "saw" it (compare the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>): as if, with the glance of the eye, he sees Sennacherib advancing rapidly to Jerusalem. The general course of this march is from the northeast to the southwest toward Jerusalem, and it is possible still to follow the route by the names of the places here mentioned, and which remain at present.<p>All the places are in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and this shows how much his rapid approach was suited to excite alarm. The name &#1506;&#1497;&#1514;  &#8219;aya&#770;th does not occur elsewhere; but &#1506;&#1497;  &#8219;ay is often mentioned, and &#1506;&#1497;&#1488;  &#8219;aya&#770;' is found in <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>. Doubtless, the same city is meant. It was situated near Bethel eastward; <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>. It was at this place that Joshua was repulsed on account of the sin of Achaz, though the city was afterward taken by Joshua, the king seized and hanged, and the city destroyed. It was afterward rebuilt, and is often mentioned; <a href="/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>. It is called by the Septuagint, &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Angai; and by Josephus, "Aina." In the time of Eusebius and Jerome, its site and scanty ruins were still pointed out, not far distant from Bethel toward the east. The name, however, has at present wholly perished, and no trace of the place now remains. It is probable that it was near the modern Deir Diwan, about three miles to the east of Bethel: "see" Robinson's "Bib. Researches," ii. pp. 119, 312, 313.<p>He is passed to Migron - That is, he does not remain at Aiath, but is advancing rapidly toward Jerusalem. This place is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>, from which it appears that it was near Gibeah, and was in the boundaries of the tribe of Benjamin, to the southwest of Ai and Bethel. No trace of this place now remains.<p>At Michmash - This was a town within the tribe of Ephraim, on the confines of Benjamin; <a href="/ezra/2-27.htm">Ezra 2:27</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-31.htm">Nehemiah 7:31</a>. This place is now called Mukhmas, and is situated on a slope or low ridge of land between two small wadys, or water-courses. It is now desolate, but bears the marks of having been a much larger and stronger place than the other towns in the neigchourhood. There are many foundations of hewn stones; and some columns are lying among them. It is about nine miles to the northeast of Jerusalem, and in the immediate neighborhood of Gibeah and Ramah. - Robinson's "Bib. Researches," ii. p. 117. In the time of Eusebius it was a large village. - "Onomast." Art. "Machmas."<p>He hath laid up his carriages - Hebrew, 'He hath deposited his weapons.' The word rendered "hath laid up" - &#1497;&#1508;&#1511;&#1497;&#1491;  yapeq&#305;&#770;yd - may possibly mean, "he reviewed," or he took an account of; that is, he made that the place of "review" preparatory to his attack on Jerusalem. Jerome says, that the passage means, that he had such confidence of taking Jerusalem, that he deposited his armor at Michmash, as being unnecessary in the siege of Jerusalem. I think, however, that the passage means simply, that he had made Michmash one of his "stations" to which he had come, and that the expression 'he hath deposited his armor there,' denotes merely that he had come there as one of his stations, and had pitched his camp in that place on the way to Jerusalem. The English word "carriage," sometimes meant formerly, "that which is carried," baggage, vessels, furniture, etc. - "Webster." In this sense it is used in this place, and also in <a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>; <a href="/acts/21-15.htm">Acts 21:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-32.

In this and the following verses is prophetically described the expedition of Sennacherib to Jerusalem, when he either went from Assyria, or returned from Egypt thither; and the several places are mentioned, through or by which he passed, or near to which he came, the tidings of which greatly distressed the inhabitants of them; and the first that is named is Ajath, thought to be the same with Ai, which was beside Bethaven, and on the east side of Bethel, <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a> and though it was burnt, and made desolate by Joshua, <a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a> yet it was afterwards rebuilt, for it was in being in Nehemiah's time; or at least there was a place of this name, which was upon or near the spot where this stood, since it is mentioned with Geba, Michmash, and Bethel, <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a> according to the ancient Jewish writers (w), it lay three miles from Jericho. Jerom (x) calls it Agai, and says that in his time there was scarce any remains of it, only the place was shown. <p>He is passed to Migron; this place, as the former, was in the tribe of Benjamin; mention is made of it, as in the uttermost part of Gibeah, <a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>. Sennacherib seems not to have stayed either in this, or the former place: <p>at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages; here was a passage, called the passage of Michmash, where was the garrison of the Philistines; and on each side of it were two rocks, one called Bozez, and the other Seneh; one of which fronted Michmash to the north, and the other Gibeah to the south, <a href="/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a> by Josephus (y) it is called Mechmas, a city; and so it is in the Apocrypha: <p>"Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of Israel.'' (1 Maccabees 9:73) <p>In Jerom's time it was a very large village, who says it was nine miles from Jerusalem (z): mention is made of it in the Misna (a), as famous for the best fine flour; and this the king of Assyria made his magazine, and in it laid up his provisions and warlike stores, from whence he might be supplied upon occasion. The words may be rendered, "he hath laid up his arms"; and Kimchi thinks he left the greatest part of his arms here, and went in haste to Jerusalem, imagining he should have no occasion for them, but should easily take it. The Targum is, <p>"at Micmas he shall appoint the princes of his army;'' <p>the generals of it: perhaps the sense is, that here he made a muster of his army, examined the arms of his soldiers, appointed the proper officers, and gave them their instructions. <p>(w) Shemot Rabba, sect. 32. fol. 135. 2.((x) De locis Hebraicis, fol. 87.

Isaiah sees it in vision (<a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription "<span class="accented">conqueror</span> of the land of Judah" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is come to Aiath</span>. "Aiath" is probably Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-28</a>), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. <span class="cmt_word">He is passed to Migron</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he has passed through Migron</span>.

The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (<a href="/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4-13</a>), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To Him the remnant of Israel would turn, but only the remnant. "For if thy people were even as the sea-sand, the remnant thereof will turn: destruction is firmly determined, flowing away righteousness. For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, completes the finishing stroke and that which is firmly determined, within the whole land." As the words are not preceded by any negative clause, ci 'im are not combined in the sense of sed or nisi; but they belong to two sentences, and signify nam si (for if). If the number of the Israelites were the highest that had been promised, only the remnant among them, or of them (bo&#772; partitive, like the French en), would turn, or, as the nearer definition ad Deum is wanting here, come back to their right position. With regard to the great mass, destruction was irrevocably determined (ra&#770;chatz, &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, then to resolve upon anything, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, <a href="/1_kings/20-40.htm">1 Kings 20:40</a>); and this destruction "overflowed with righteousness," or rather "flowed on (sho&#772;te&#772;ph, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-18.htm">Isaiah 28:18</a>) righteousness," i.e., brought forth righteousness as it flowed onwards, so that it was like a swell of the penal righteousness of God (sha&#770;taph, with the accusative, according to Ges. 138, Anm. 2). That cilla&#770;yo&#772;n is not used here in the sense of completion any more than in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>, where ca&#770;la&#770;h (fem. of ca&#770;leh, that which vanishes, then the act of vanishing, the end) is used interchangeably with it, and nechera&#770;tza&#770;h indicates judgment as a thing irrevocably decided (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>, and borrowed from these passages in <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>). Such a judgment of extermination the almighty Judge had determined to carry fully out (&#8219;o&#772;seh in the sense of a fut. instans) within all the land (b'kereb, within, not b'thok, in the midst of), that is to say, one that would embrace the whole land and all the people, and would destroy, if not every individual without exception, at any rate the great mass, except a very few. </body></html>
