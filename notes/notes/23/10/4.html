There has been a great variety of interpretation affixed to this expression. The sense in which our translators understood it was, evidently, that they should be forsaken of God; and that, as the effect of this, they should bow down under the condition of captives, or among the slain. The Vulgate and the Septuagint, however. and many interpreters understand the word bore as a simple negative. 'Where will you flee for refuge? Where will you deposit your wealth so as not to bow down under a chain?' Vulgate, Ne incurvemini sub vinculo. Septuagint, &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  tou me&#772; empesein eis apago&#772;ne&#772;n - 'Not to fall into captivity.' The Hebrew will bear either mode of construction. Vitringa and Lowth understand it as our translators have done, as meaning that God would forsake them, and that without him, that is, deprived of his aid, they would be destroyed.<p>They shall bow down - They shall be subdued, as armies are that are taken captive.<p>Under the prisoners - That is, under the "condition" of prisoners; or as prisoner. Some understand it to mean, that they should bear down "in the place of prisoners;" that is, in prison, But it evidently means, simply, that they should be captives.<p>They shall fall under the slain - They shall be slain. Gesenius renders it, "'Among the prisoners, and "among" the slain.'" The Chaldee reads it, 'You shall be east into chains out of your own land, and beyond your own cities you shall be cast out slain.' Vitringa supposes that the prophet, in this verse, refers to the custom, among the ancients, of placing prisoners in war under a yoke of wood to indicate their captivity. That such a custom obtained, there can be no doubt; but it is not probable that Isaiah refers to it here. The simple idea is, that many of them should be taken captive, and many of them slain. This prediction was fulfilled in the invasion of Tiglath-pileser; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>; 16.<p>For all this - Notwithstanding these calamities. The cup of punishment is not filled by these, but the divine judgment shall still be poured out further upon the nation. The anger of God shall not be fully expressed by these minor inflictions of his wrath, but his hand shall continue to be stretched out until the whole nation shall be overwhelmed and ruined; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The easiest explanation perhaps is to take it as the answer to the questions of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm" title="And what will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will you flee for help? and where will you leave your glory?">Isaiah 10:3</a></span> : (<span class="bld">they can do nothing</span>) <span class="bld">except crouch under the captives and fall under the slain</span>. Another is “Except one (here and there) crouch among captives, they must fell under the slain.” Objections to both occur readily enough to anyone who reads the Hebrew, especially the abrupt changes from singular to plural. An ingenious conjecture of Lagarde’s gives the sense “Beltis crouches, Osiris is broken (<span class="greekheb">חַת אֹסִיר כֵּלְתִּי כֹּרַעַת</span> cf. <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm" title="Declare you among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.">Jeremiah 50:2</a>), they fall, &c.”; i.e. the heathen gods shall be unable to give protection to their votaries. But there is no evidence that <span class="ital">Egyptian</span> deities (Osiris) were worshipped in Israel in Isaiah’s time; and in any case their sudden introduction here would be surprising.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his hand is stretched out still</span>] See on ch. <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets.

That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by <a href="/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10:4</a>), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have "his anger," "his hand." It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - "unless," "except." Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (<a href="/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3, 6</a>.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased. Crushed beneath the iron heel of their conquerors, Israel ceased to exist as a nation. SECTION V. PROPHECIES OF WOE UPON FOREIGN NATIONS (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-23</a>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Strophe 3. "For the wickedness burneth up like fire: it devours thorns and thistles, and burns in the thickets of the wood; and they smoke upwards in a lofty volume of smoke. Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts the land is turned into coal, and the nation has become like the food of fire: not one spares his brother. They hew on the right, and are hungry; and devour on the left, and are not satisfied: they devour the flesh of their own arm: Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: these together over Judah. With all this His anger is not turned away, and His hand is stretched out still." The standpoint of the prophet is at the extreme end of the course of judgment, and from that he looks back. Consequently this link of the chain is also past in his view, and hence the future conversives. The curse, which the apostasy of Israel carries within itself, now breaks fully out. Wickedness, i.e., the constant thirst of evil, is a fire which a man kindles in himself. And when the grace of God, which damps and restrains this fire, is all over, it is sure to burst forth: the wickedness bursts forth like fire (the verb is used here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, with reference to the wrath of God). And this is the case with the wickedness of Israel, which now consumes first of all thorns and thistles, i.e., individual sinners who are the most ripe for judgment, upon whom the judgment commences, and then the thicket of the wood (sib-che,<p>(Note: The metheg (gaya) in &#1505;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497; (to be pronounced sib-che) has simply the caphonic effect of securing a distinct enunciation to the sibilant letter (in other instances to the guttural, vid., &#8219;arboth, <a href="/numbers/31-12.htm">Numbers 31:12</a>), in cases where the second syllable of the word commences with a guttural or labial letter, or with an aspirate.)<p>as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>, from sebac, <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>  equals  sobec), that is to say, the great mass of the people, which is woven together by bands of iniquity (vattizzath is not a reflective niphal, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, but kal, to kindle into anything, i.e., to set it on fire). The contrast intended in the two figures is consequently not the high and low (Ewald), nor the useless and useful (Drechsler), but individuals and the whole (Vitringa). The fire, into which the wickedness bursts out, seizes individuals first of all; and then, like a forest fire, it seizes upon the nation at large in all its ranks and members, who "whirl up (roll up) ascending of smoke," i.e., who roll up in the form of ascending smoke (hith'abbek, a synonym of hithhappe&#772;k, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>, to curl or roll). This fire of wickedness was no other than the wrath (ebra&#770;h) of God: it is God's own wrath, for all sin carries this within itself as its own self-punishment. By this fire of wrath the soil of the land is gradually but thoroughly burnt out, and the people of the land utterly consumed: &#1506;&#1514;&#1501; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3; to be red-hot (lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, also the Targum), and to be dark or black (Arabic &#8219;atame, late at night), for what is burnt out becomes black. Fire and darkness are therefore correlative terms throughout the whole of the Scriptures. So far do the figures extend, in which the prophet presents the inmost essence of this stage of judgment. In its historical manifestation it consisted in the most inhuman self-destruction during an anarchical civil war. Destitute of any tender emotions, they devoured one another without being satisfied: ga&#770;zar, to cut, to hew (hence the Arabic for a butcher): zero'o, his arm, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a>, equivalent to the member of his own family and tribe, who was figuratively called his arm (Arabic &#8219;adud: see Ges. Thes. p. 433), as being the natural protector and support. This interminable self-immolation, and the regicide associated with the jealousy of the different tribes, shook the northern kingdom again and again to its utter destruction. And the readiness with which the unbrotherly feelings of the northern tribes towards one another could turn into combined hostility towards Judah, was evident enough from the Syro-Ephraimitish war, the consequences of which had not passed away at the time when these prophecies were uttered. This hostility on the part of the brother kingdoms would still further increase. And the end of the judgments of wrath had not come yet.  </body></html>
