Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the cry is gone round about ... - The cry of distress and calamity has encompassed the whole land of Moab.

"They go up to the temple-house and Dibon, up to the heights to weep: upon Nebo and upon Medebah of Moab there is weeping: on all heads baldness, every beard is mutilated. In the markets of Moab they gird themselves with sackcloth; on the roofs of the land, and in its streets, everything wails, melting into tears. Heshbon cries, and 'Elle; even to Jahaz they hear their howling; even the armed men of Moab break out into mourning thereat; its soul trembles within it." The people (the subject to &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;) ascend the mountain with the temple of Chemosh, the central sanctuary of the land. This temple is called hab-baith, though not that there was a Moabitish town or village with some such name as Bth-Diblathaim (<a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>), as Knobel supposes. Dibon, which lay above the Arnon (Wady Mujib), like all the places mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2-4</a>, at present a heap of ruins, a short hour to the north of the central Arnon, in the splendid plain of el-Chura, had consecrated heights in the neighbourhood (cf., <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>), and therefore would turn to them. Moab mourns upon Nebo and Medebah; &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, for which we find &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, is written intentionally for a double preformative, instead of &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; (compare the similar forms in <a href="/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>, and Ges. 70, Anm.). &#1506;&#1500; is to be taken in a local sense, as Hendewerk, Drechsler, and Knobel have rendered it. For Nebo was probably a place situated upon a height on the mountain of that name, towards the south-east of Heshbon (the ruins of Nabo, Nabau, mentioned in the Onom.); and Medebah (still a heap of ruins bearing the same name) stood upon a round hill about two hours to the south-east of Heshbon. According to Jerome, there was an image of Chemosh in Nebo; and among the ruins of Madeba, Seetzen discovered the foundations of a strange temple. There follows here a description of the expressions of pain. Instead of the usual &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1493;, we read &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1493; here. And instead of gedu&#8219;a&#770;h (abscissae), Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>) has, according to his usual style, geru'a&#770;h (decurtatae), with the simple alteration of a single letter.<p>(Note: At the same time, the Masora on this passage before us is for geru&#8219;ah with Resh, and we also find this reading in Nissel, Clodius, Jablonsky, and in earlier editions; whilst Sonc. 1486, Ven. 1521, and others, have gedu&#8219;ah, with Daleth.)<p>All runs down with weeping (culloh, written as in <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>, we have cullo instead). In other cases it is the eyes that are said to run down in tears, streams, or water-brooks; but here, by a still bolder metonymy, the whole man is said to flow down to the ground, as if melting in a stream of tears. Heshbon and Elale are still visible in their ruins, which lie only half an hour apart upon their separate hills and are still called by the names Husban and el-Al. They were both situated upon hills which commanded an extensive prospect. And there the cry of woe created an echo which was audible as far as Jahaz (Jahza), the city where the king of Heshbon offered battle to Israel in the time of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32</a>). The general mourning was so great, that even the armed men, i.e., the heroes (<a href="/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>) of Moab, were seized with despair, and cried out in their anguish (the same figure as in <a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;(, thereat, namely on account of this universal lamentation. Thus the lamentation was universal, without exception. Naphsho (his soul) refers to Moab as a whole nation. The soul of Moab trembles in all the limbs of the national body; &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (forming a play upon the sound with &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;), an Arabic word, and in &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; a Hebrew word also, signifies tremere, huc illuc agitari - an explanation which we prefer, with Rosenmller and Gesenius, to the idea that &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; is a secondary verb to &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, fut. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;. &#1500;&#1493; is an ethical dative (as in <a href="/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>), throwing the action or the pathos inwardly (see Psychology, p. 152). The heart of the prophet participates in this pain with which Moab is agitated throughout; for, as Rashi observes, it is just in this that the prophets of Israel were distinguished from heathen prophets, such as Balaam for example, viz., that the calamities which they announced to the nations went to their own heart (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>, with <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a>). </body></html>
