Vitringa, however, thinks that Nebuchadnezzar is pointed out in this clause; who, after the Moabites, reduced extremely low by the Assyrians, began to recruit themselves, should give the remnant of the nation to destruction, and complete the judgment which the Assyrian had begun: see <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm" title="The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make your land desolate; and your cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm" title="Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.">Jeremiah 48:40</a>.

Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the waters of Dimon - Probably the same as "Dibon" <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. Eusobius says it was a large town on the northern bank of the river Arnon. Jerome says that the letters "m and b" are often interchanged in oriental dialects (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>).<p>Shall be full of blood - That is, the number of the slain of Moab shall be so great, that the blood shall color the waters of the river - a very common occurrence in times of great slaughter. Perhaps by the "waters" of Dimon the prophet does not mean the river Arnon, but the small rivulets or streams that might flow into it near to the city of Dibon. Probably there were winter brooks there, which do not run at all seasons. The Chaldee renders it, 'The waters of Dimon shall be full of blood, because I will place upon Dimon an assembly of armies.'<p>For I will bring more upon Dimon - Hebrew, 'I will bring additions;' that is, I will bring upon it additional calamities. Jerome says, that by those additional calamities, the prophet refers to the "lions" which are immediately after mentioned. "Lions upon him that escapeth of Moab." Wild beasts upon those who escaped from the slaughter, and who took refuge in the wilderness, or on the mountains. The Chaldee renders it, 'A king shall ascend with an army, and shall destroy the remainder of their land.' Aben Ezra interprets it of the king of Assyria; and Jarchi of Nebuchadnezzar, who is called a lion in <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>. Vitringa also supposes that Nebnchadnezzar is meant. But it is more probable that the prophet refers to wild beasts, which are often referred to in the Scriptures as objects of dread, and as bringing calamities upon nations (see <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-25.htm">2 Kings 18:25</a>).<p>Upon the remnant of the land - Upon all those who escaped the desolation of the war. The Septuagint and the Arabic render this, 'Upon the remnant of Adama,' understanding the word rendered 'land' (&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;  'a&#774;da&#770;ma&#770;h), as the name of a city.

Vitringa understands Nebuchadnezzar as meant by "the lion"; but it is plural, "lions." The "more," or in Hebrew, "additions," he explains of the addition made to the waters of Dimon by the streams of blood of the slain.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Dimon:</span> this seems to be the same place with <span class="ital">Dibon</span>, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm" title="He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.">Isaiah 15:2</a></span>, here called Dimon for the great bloodshed in it, as it here follows; such changes of a letter being not unusual in proper names, as in Merodach for Berodach, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">More</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Targum interprets it, <p>"the congregation of an army;'' <p>but what these additions were are explained in the next clause: <p>lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land; or a "lion" (s); the meaning is, that such who escaped the sword should be destroyed by lions, or other beasts of prey, which was one of the Lord's four judgments, <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>.

The conjecture may be taken for what it is worth; it has the authority of Jerome, who says, “usque hodie indifferenter et Dimon et Dibon hoc oppidulum dicitur,” and we know of no other place Dimon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will bring more</span> (lit. “additional [evils]”) <span class="ital">upon Dimon</span>] This is the first strictly prophetic utterance in the passage; the speaker is Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lions upon … Moab</span>] Better: <span class="bld">upon the fugitives of Moab</span> (sc.

It can hardly be Jeroboam II., who has already done his worst, and it is still less likely that Judah is meant. The peculiar prophetic form of the latter part of the verse has suggested to some commentators that it may have been inserted by Isaiah in the original oracle. In that case the “lion” would almost of necessity denote the Assyrians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters of Dimon</span>. It is thought that "Dimon" is here put for "Dibon," in order to assimilate the sound to that of <span class="accented">dam</span>, blood. St. Jerome says that in his day the place was called indifferently by either name. If we accept this view, "the waters of Dimon" will probably be those of the <span class="accented">Amen</span>, near which Dibon was situated (see the comment on ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I will bring more</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I will bring additions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> additional calamities, which will cause the stream of the Aton to flow with blood. <span class="cmt_word">Lions</span>; or, <span class="accented">a lieu</span>.

"They go up to the temple-house and Dibon, up to the heights to weep: upon Nebo and upon Medebah of Moab there is weeping: on all heads baldness, every beard is mutilated. In the markets of Moab they gird themselves with sackcloth; on the roofs of the land, and in its streets, everything wails, melting into tears. Heshbon cries, and 'Elle; even to Jahaz they hear their howling; even the armed men of Moab break out into mourning thereat; its soul trembles within it." The people (the subject to &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;) ascend the mountain with the temple of Chemosh, the central sanctuary of the land. This temple is called hab-baith, though not that there was a Moabitish town or village with some such name as Bth-Diblathaim (<a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>), as Knobel supposes. Dibon, which lay above the Arnon (Wady Mujib), like all the places mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2-4</a>, at present a heap of ruins, a short hour to the north of the central Arnon, in the splendid plain of el-Chura, had consecrated heights in the neighbourhood (cf., <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>), and therefore would turn to them. Moab mourns upon Nebo and Medebah; &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, for which we find &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, is written intentionally for a double preformative, instead of &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; (compare the similar forms in <a href="/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>, and Ges. 70, Anm.). &#1506;&#1500; is to be taken in a local sense, as Hendewerk, Drechsler, and Knobel have rendered it. For Nebo was probably a place situated upon a height on the mountain of that name, towards the south-east of Heshbon (the ruins of Nabo, Nabau, mentioned in the Onom.); and Medebah (still a heap of ruins bearing the same name) stood upon a round hill about two hours to the south-east of Heshbon. According to Jerome, there was an image of Chemosh in Nebo; and among the ruins of Madeba, Seetzen discovered the foundations of a strange temple. There follows here a description of the expressions of pain. Instead of the usual &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1493;, we read &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1493; here. And instead of gedu&#8219;a&#770;h (abscissae), Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>) has, according to his usual style, geru'a&#770;h (decurtatae), with the simple alteration of a single letter.<p>(Note: At the same time, the Masora on this passage before us is for geru&#8219;ah with Resh, and we also find this reading in Nissel, Clodius, Jablonsky, and in earlier editions; whilst Sonc. 1486, Ven. 1521, and others, have gedu&#8219;ah, with Daleth.)<p>All runs down with weeping (culloh, written as in <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>, we have cullo instead). In other cases it is the eyes that are said to run down in tears, streams, or water-brooks; but here, by a still bolder metonymy, the whole man is said to flow down to the ground, as if melting in a stream of tears. Heshbon and Elale are still visible in their ruins, which lie only half an hour apart upon their separate hills and are still called by the names Husban and el-Al. They were both situated upon hills which commanded an extensive prospect. And there the cry of woe created an echo which was audible as far as Jahaz (Jahza), the city where the king of Heshbon offered battle to Israel in the time of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32</a>). The general mourning was so great, that even the armed men, i.e., the heroes (<a href="/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>) of Moab, were seized with despair, and cried out in their anguish (the same figure as in <a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;(, thereat, namely on account of this universal lamentation. Thus the lamentation was universal, without exception. Naphsho (his soul) refers to Moab as a whole nation. The soul of Moab trembles in all the limbs of the national body; &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (forming a play upon the sound with &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;), an Arabic word, and in &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; a Hebrew word also, signifies tremere, huc illuc agitari - an explanation which we prefer, with Rosenmller and Gesenius, to the idea that &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; is a secondary verb to &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, fut. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;. &#1500;&#1493; is an ethical dative (as in <a href="/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>), throwing the action or the pathos inwardly (see Psychology, p. 152). The heart of the prophet participates in this pain with which Moab is agitated throughout; for, as Rashi observes, it is just in this that the prophets of Israel were distinguished from heathen prophets, such as Balaam for example, viz., that the calamities which they announced to the nations went to their own heart (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>, with <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a>). </body></html>
