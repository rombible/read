The comparative obscurity of that history, the names of towns and villages which it is difficult to identify, present a striking contrast to the evolution of the great world-drama which is brought before us in the “burden” of Babylon. What light can be thrown on that obscurity must be gathered from what we can learn of the contemporary history of Moab and its relation to Israel. This we know partly from the record of 2 Kings 3, partly from the inscription of the Moabite stone found at Diban, in 1860, by Mr. Klein, and translated by Dr. Ginsburg in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 163. Combining the information from these two sources, we find that Omri and Ahab had subdued Moab when that nation was governed by Chemosh-Gad of Dibon, and had compelled him to pay a sheep tribute reckoned by hundreds of thousands. When Jehoram succeeded Ahab, Mesha, the son of Chemosh-Gad, revolted, and the Moabite inscription records the successful issue of the campaign. Jehoram entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom. The Moabites were defeated. Their trees were cut down, their wells stopped, and their land made barren. The king of Moab in his despair offered up his son as a sacrifice to Chemosh in the sight of both armies. With that sacrifice apparently the tide of victory turned. Mesha, in his inscription, records how he took Nebo from Israel and slew seven thousand men, and built or restored fortified towns, and offered the vessels of Jehovah, taken probably from the sanctuaries of the “high places” of Nebo. Exulting in the memory of this victory, Moab became “exceeding proud” (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>), and in a psalm, probably contemporary with Isaiah (see the mention of Assur, or Assyria, in <a href="/psalms/83-8.htm" title="Assur also is joined with them: they have helped the children of Lot. Selah.">Psalm 83:8</a>), they are named as among the enemies of Judah, joined with the Philistines and Assyrians. It is probable enough that, having been kept in check-by the prosperous rule of Uzziah, they took advantage of the weakness of Ahaz to renew hostilities, and were looking, half with dread, half with hope, to the Assyrian power. It may be noted here that the following cities named in these chapters—Dibon, Medeba, Nebo, Horonaim—occur also in the Moabite stone, which thus renders a striking testimony to their antiquity, and, so far, to their authenticity. (Comp. Jeremiah 48, which is, to a large extent, a reproduction of Isaiah’s language.)<p><span class= "bld">Ar of Moab is laid waste.</span>—This was apparently the older capital (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>), sometimes known as Rabbath Moab. In Jerome’s time it was known as Areopolis, the Greeks catching, probably, at the resemblance between the name Ar and that of their god, Ares. Probably Ar was a Moabite form of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Ir, </span>a city. One of the names survives in the modern <span class= "ital">Rabba; </span>but the ruins are comparatively insignificant. The prophet begins with words of threatening. Both that city and Kir (here again the word means “city,” and if we identify it, as most experts do, with <span class= "ital">Kerek, </span>the castle on a hill, which rises to 1,000 feet above the Dead Sea, it must have been the strongest of the Moabite fortresses) were to be attacked at night, when resistance was most hopeless. So Mesha boasts (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 66) that he had taken Nebo by a night attack. We note the emphasis of iteration in the words “laid waste and brought to silence.” The latter clause would be more accurately rendered <span class= "ital">cut off, </span>or <span class= "ital">destroyed.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab.

This prophecy, which occupies this and the next chapter, very improperly separated from each other, makes the third discourse of this second part. The time of the delivery, and consequently of the completion of it, (which was to be in three years after,) is uncertain, neither of them being marked in the prophecy, nor recorded in history. “But the most probable account is, that it was delivered soon after the foregoing, in the first year of Hezekiah; and that it was accomplished in his fourth year, when Shalmaneser invaded the kingdom of Israel. He might probably march through Moab; and, to secure every thing behind him, possess himself of the whole country, by taking the principal strong places, Ar and Kir-haresh. Jeremiah has introduced much of this prophecy of Isaiah into his own larger prophecy against the same people, (chap. 48.,) denouncing God’s judgments on Moab, subsequent to the calamity here foretold, to be executed by Nebuchadnezzar.” Bishop Lowth. <span class="ital">In the night </span>— Or, <span class="ital">in a night, </span>suddenly and unexpectedly, <span class="ital">Ar of Moab is laid waste </span>— The chief city of Moab, <a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>. <span class="ital">Kir of Moab is laid waste </span>— Another eminent city of Moab, called more largely and fully, Kir-hareseth and Kir-haresh, <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm" title="Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall you mourn; surely they are stricken.">Isaiah 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm" title="Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.">Jeremiah 48:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm" title="Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he has gotten are perished.">Jeremiah 48:36</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites.   - This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burden of Moab - (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>).

A heavy, grievous prophecy, concerning the destruction of Moab.

Kimchi conjectures it to be the same with Aroer, which was by the brink of the river Arnon, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a> and is mentioned with Dibon, as this, in <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a> of which notice is taken, and not of Ar, in <a href="/jeremiah/48-19.htm">Jeremiah 48:19</a>. Some versions take Ar to signify a "city", and render it, "the city of Moab", without naming what city it was; and the Targum calls it by another name, Lahajath; but, be it what city it will, it was destroyed in the night; in such a night, as Kimchi interprets it; in the space of a night, very suddenly, when the inhabitants of it were asleep and secure, and had no notice of danger; and so the Targum adds, <p>"and they were asleep.'' <p>Some have thought this circumstance is mentioned with a view to the night work, that work of darkness of Lot and his daughter, which gave rise to Moab; however, in a night this city became desolate, being taken and plundered, and its inhabitants put to the sword, and so reduced to silence; though the last word may as well be rendered "cut off" (n), utterly destroyed, being burnt or pulled down; two words are made use of, to denote the utter destruction of it: <p>because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; either in the same night, or rather in another.

The verse stands somewhat apart from the sequel of the poem. It announces the catastrophe which has placed the entire country at the mercy of the invaders, viz. the fall of the two chief cities of Moab. What follows is a description, not of the further progress of the campaign, but first of the universal mourning caused by this sudden blow, and second, of the flight of the inhabitants. The opening word <span class="ital">because</span> seems to have the force of an interjection, equivalent to “yea” or “surely.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the night</span>] may be meant literally (by a night attack), or we may render “in a night,” i.e. “suddenly.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ar</span>] the capital of Moab, lay on the Arnon (<a href="/numbers/21-15.htm" title="And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.">Numbers 21:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>). It is not to be confounded (as is sometimes done) with the later capital Rabba, which lies about 10 miles further south. <span class="ital">Kir of Moab</span> is the modern Kerak, some 17 miles S. of the Arnon. It is perhaps identical with <span class="ital">Kir-hareseth</span> or <span class="ital">Kir Heres</span> (ch. <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm" title="Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall you mourn; surely they are stricken.">Isaiah 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-25.htm" title="And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however, the slingers went about it, and smote it.">2 Kings 3:25</a>); its situation has always been considered well-nigh impregnable.

The possession of this coveted tract of country was one great motive of the interminable wars between the two nations. Mesha’s inscription on the Moabite Stone is really an account of the reconquest of this region from Ahab. At the time of the prophecy Moab must have long held undisputed possession of these lands.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - THE BURDEN OF MOAB. The present chapter and the next are very closely connected, and may be regarded as together constituting "the burden of Moab." It has been argued on critical grounds that the bulk of the prophecy is quoted by Isaiah from an earlier writer, and that he has merely modified the wording and added a few touches here and there (so Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Maurer, Ewald, Knobel, and Cheyne). Jeremiah is thought to have also based his "judgment of Moab" (<a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.) on the same early writing. But speculations of this kind are in the highest degree uncertain, and moreover lead to no results of the slightest importance. It is best, therefore, to regard Isaiah as the author of these two chapters. Having threatened Philistia, Israel's nearest enemy upon the west, he turns to Moab, her nearest foe towards the east. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. An elliptical beginning. Mr. Cheyne supposes some such words as "Lament for Moab," or "Alas for Moab!" to have been in the writer's mind, but to have been omitted through "lyrical excitement." <span class="cmt_word">In the night</span>. This is best taken literally. Night attacks, though not common in antiquity, were not unknown. Mesha, King of Moab, boasts that he "went in the night" against Nebo, and assaulted it at early dawn (Moabite Stone, I. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Ar of Moab</span>; or, <span class="accented">Ar-Moab</span>. An ancient city, mentioned among those taken from the Moabites by Sihon (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>). According to Jerome, it was called in Roman times Areopolis, or Rabbath-Moab. Modern geographers identify it with <span class="accented">Rabba</span>, a place on the old Roman road between <span class="accented">Kerak</span> and <span class="accented">Arair</span>, south of the Amen, where there are some ancient remains, though they are not very extensive (Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 377). <span class="cmt_word">Is laid waste, and brought to silence</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is stormed</span>, <span class="accented">is ruined</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kir of Moab</span>. "Kir of Moab" is reasonably identified with <span class="accented">Kerak</span>, a place very strongly situated on a mountain peak, about ten miles flora the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows, apparently out of all connection, another prophecy against Asshur. It is introduced here quite abruptly, like a fragment; and it is an enigma how it got here, and what it means here, though not an enigma without solution. This short Assyrian passage reads as follows. "Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, that takes place; to break Asshur to pieces in my land, and upon my mountain will I tread him under foot: then his yoke departs from them, and his burden will depart from their neck. This is the purpose that is purposed over the whole earth; and this the hand that is stretched out over all nations. For Jehovah of hosts hath purposed, and who could bring it to nought? And His hand that is stretched out, who can turn it back?" It is evidently a totally different judicial catastrophe which is predicted here, inasmuch as the world-power upon which it falls is not called Babel or Chasdim, but Asshur, which cannot possibly be taken as a name for Babylon (Abravanel, Lowth, etc.). Babylon is destroyed by the Medes, whereas Asshur falls to ruin in the mountain-land of Jehovah, which it is seeking to subjugate - a prediction which was literally fulfilled. And only when this had taken place did a fitting occasion present itself for a prophecy against Babel, the heiress of the ruined Assyrian power. Consequently the two prophecies against Babel and Asshur form a hysteron-proteron as they stand here. The thought which occasioned this arrangement, and which it is intended to set forth, is expressed by Jeremiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-18.htm">Jeremiah 50:18-19</a>, "Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria." The one event was a pledge of the other. At a time when the prophecy against Assyria had actually been fulfilled, the prophet attached it to the still unfulfilled prophecy against Babylon, to give a pledge of the fulfilment of the latter. This was the pedestal upon which the Massa&#770;h Ba&#770;bel was raised. And it was doubly suited for this, on account of its purely epilogical tone from <a href="/isaiah/14-26.htm">Isaiah 14:26</a> onwards. </body></html>
