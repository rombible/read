Or, "O ye that go down", &amp;c.; what poor foolish creatures are you! And in the end what miserable and wretched ones will ye be! Such were the Jewish rulers and people, who either went themselves, or sent ambassadors to the king of Egypt, to supply them with men and horses against the king of Assyria, contrary to the express command of God, which forbid them returning to Egypt; and which showed their unmindfulness of deliverance from thence, and their not having a due sense of that mercy upon them; as well as their so doing exposed them to the danger of being drawn into the superstitions and idolatries of that people: <p>and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; having their dependence upon, and placing their confidence in, the strength and numbers of the cavalry of the Egyptians: <p>but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord; they did not look unto the Lord with an eye of faith, nor seek him by prayer and supplication; or ask any counsel or instruction of him, as the Targum paraphrases the last clause; so that their sin lay not only in their confidence in the creature, but in their neglect of the Lord himself; and so all such persons are foolish and miserable, that trust in an arm of flesh, that place their confidence in creature acts, in their own righteousness, duties, and services, and have no regard to the Holy One of Israel, to the holiness and righteousness of Christ, neglect that, and do not submit to it; thus the Targum interprets the former clause of the Word of the Holy One of Israel, the essential Word Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe to them that <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because <i>they are</i> many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> seek the LORD!</span><p>(a) There were two special reasons why the Israelites should not join with the Egyptians: first, because the Lord had commanded them never to return there, De 17:16,28:68 lest they should forget the benefit of their redemption: and secondly, lest they should be corrupted with the superstition and idolatry of the Egyptians, and so forsake God, Jer 2:18.<p>(b) Meaning, that they forsake the Lord, if they put their trust in worldly things: for they cannot trust in both.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. Woe to them that put their trust in the horses and chariots of Egypt! The Jews were painfully conscious of their weakness in cavalry as compared with the Assyrians, and this was one of the considerations that made a league with Egypt so attractive in their eyes (see ch. <a href="/isaiah/30-16.htm" title="But you said, No; for we will flee on horses; therefore shall you flee: and, We will ride on the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.">Isaiah 30:16</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/36-8.htm" title="Now therefore give pledges, I pray you, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them....">Isaiah 36:8-9</a>). Egypt was always renowned in antiquity for its strength in this arm (Hom. <span class="ital">Iliad</span> ix. 383; Diodorus, i. 45). To the prophets horses and chariots were in themselves objectionable as embodiments of irreligious militarism (cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm" title="Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:">Isaiah 2:7</a>); they were of course doubly so when obtained through compacts with foreign states.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither seek the Lord</span>] i.e. seek His counsel (<a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm" title="That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!">Isaiah 30:2</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - A FURTHER WARNING AGAINST SEEKING THE ALLIANCE OF EGYPT. This prophecy seems to be quite independent of the last (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>). It may have been given earlier or later. The chief point brought out, which had not distinctly appeared previously, is the value set on the horses and chariots of Egypt in the conflict with Assyria (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>; and see also the earlier prophecy, <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-6</a>). The examples of Samaria, Gaza, and Ashdod might well have taught the lesson of distrust of Egypt, without any Divine warnings (see G. Smith's 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 125-131). But the Jews were infatuated, and relied on Egypt despite her previous failures to give effective aid. <span class="cmt_word">And stay on horses</span>. The Assyrian cavalry was very numerous, and very efficient. It is often represented on the monuments. Egyptian cavalry, on the other hand, is not represented at all; and it may be questioned whether, in the early times, the Egyptian war-horses were not entirely employed in the chariot-service (see 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, p. 321). The later dynasties of Egyptian kings, however, employed cavalry, as appears from <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; Herod., 2:162; 'Records of the Past,' vol. it. pp. 68, 70, 72, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And trust in chariots, because they are many</span>. The large number of the chariots maintained by the Pharaohs is abundantly evidenced. Diodorus assigns to Sesostris twenty-seven thousand (1. 54, &sect; 4). This is, no doubt, an exaggeration; but the six hundred of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and even the one thousand two hundred of Shishak(<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) are moderate computations, quite in accord with the monuments, and with all that we otherwise know of Egyptian warfare. Egypt exported chariots to the neighboring countries (<a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and was at this time the only power which seemed capable of furnishing such a chariot-force as could hope to contend on tolerably even terms with the force of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">They look not unto the Holy One of Israel</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11, 12</a>). The trust in the Egyptian alliance was accompanied by a distrust of Jehovah and his power, and a disinclination to look to him for aid. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning His wrath, and quantity of smoke: His lips are full of wrathful foam, and His tongue like devouring fire. And His breath is like an overflowing brook, which reaches half-way to the neck, to sift nations in the sieve of nothingness; and a misleading bridle comes to the cheeks of the nations." Two figures are here melted together - namely, that of a storm coming up from the farthest horizon, which turns the sky into a sea of fire, and kindles whatever it strikes, so that there rises up a heavy burden, or thick mass of smoke (ko&#772;bhed massa&#770;'a&#770;h, like mas'e&#772;th in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, cf., <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>; on this attributive combination, burning His wrath (Ewald, 288, c) and a quantity, etc., see <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>); and that of a man burning with wrath, whose lips foam, whose tongue moves to and fro like a flame, and whose breath is a snorting that threatens destruction, which when it issues from Jehovah swells into a stream, which so far covers a man that only his neck appears as the visible half. We had the same figure in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>, where Asshur, as it came upon Judah, was compared to such an almost overwhelming and drowning flood. Here, again, it refers to Judah, which the wrath of Jehovah had almost though not entirely destroyed. For the ultimate object of the advancing name of Jehovah (she&#772;m, name, relating to His judicial coming) is to sift nations, etc.: laha&#774;na&#770;pha&#770;h for leha&#770;n&#305;&#772;ph (like laha&#774;za&#770;da&#770;h in <a href="/daniel/5-20.htm">Daniel 5:20</a>), to make it more like na&#770;pha&#770;h in sound. The sieve of nothingness is a sieve in which everything, that does not remain in it as good corn, is given up to annihilation; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is want of being, i.e., of life from God, and denotes the fate that properly belongs to such worthlessness. In the case of v'resen (and a bridle, etc.) we must either supply in thought &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;), or, what is better, take it as a substantive clause: "a misleading bridle" (or a bridle of misleading, as Bttcher renders it, math&#8219;eh being the form mashqeh) holds the cheeks of the nations. The nations are regarded as wild horses, which could not be tamed, but which were now so firmly bound and controlled by the wrath of God, that they were driven down into the abyss. </body></html>
