As the king of beasts stands haughtily defiant over the prey which he has made his own against the shepherds who seek to rob him of it, so will Jehovah, in His character as the Lord of hosts, refuse to surrender Jerusalem, His peculiar possession, to the armies of the Assyrians.

The second clause simply marks Jerusalem as the scene of the conflict, but agrees in substance with the first. Looking to the verse that follows, the idea of protection seems more natural than that of hostility. The thought of supreme ownership, however, includes both; Jerusalem belonged to Jehovah to protect or to chastise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/31-4.htm" title="For thus has the LORD spoken to me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof....">Isaiah 31:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>or <span class="ital">but </span>or, <span class="ital">nevertheless, thus hath the Lord spoken </span>— That is, although you have done evil in sending to Egypt for help, and they will not be able to help you, yet the Lord will of his own grace, and for the glory of his own name, give you that help and deliverance which you do not deserve, and had no reason to expect from him. <span class="ital">Like as the lion roaring on his prey </span>— When he is ready to seize upon and devour it; <span class="ital">he will not be afraid, nor abase himself </span>— So as to be in the least moved, either to quit his prey, or to make any more haste than otherwise he would do in seizing it. <span class="ital">So shall the Lord of hosts fight for mount Zion </span>— With such an unshaken and undaunted resolution, not to be moved by any opposition: and he will as easily and irresistibly destroy the Assyrian army, as a lion tears a lamb in pieces. <span class="ital">As birds flying, </span>&c. — Which come from above, and so cannot be kept off; which fly swiftly, and engage themselves readily and resolutely, when they perceive their young ones are in danger.

To do this the prophet makes use of two striking illustrations, the first of which is, that Yahweh would be no more alarmed at the number and power of their enemies than a fierce lion would be that was intent on his prey, and could not be frightened from it by any number of men that should come against him. The "point" of this comparison is, that as the lion that "was intent on his purpose" could not be frightened from it by numbers, so it would be with Yahweh, who "was equally intent on his purpose" - the defense of the city of Jerusalem. It does not mean, of course, that the purpose of God and of the lion resembled each other, but merely that there was similar "intensity of purpose," and similar adherence to it notwithstanding all opposition. The figure is one that denotes the highest vigilance, firmness, steadiness, and a determination on the part of Yahweh that Jerusalem should not fall into the hands of the Assyrians.<p>Like as the lion - The divine nature and purposes are often represented in the Scriptures by metaphors, allegories, and comparisons taken from animals, and especially from the lion (see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-20.htm">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>; <a href="/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>).<p>And the young lion - The vigorous, strong, fierce lion. The use of the two here, gives intensity and strength to the comparison. It is observable that the lion is seldom mentioned alone in the Scriptures.<p>Roaring on his prey - Roaring as he seizes on his prey. This is the moment of the greatest intensity of purpose in the lion, and it is therefore used by Isaiah to denote the intense purpose of Yahweh to defend Jerusalem, and not to be deterred by any number of enemies.<p>When a multitude of shepherds is called forth - When the neighborhood is alarmed, and all the inhabitants turn out to destroy him. This comparison is almost exactly in the spirit and language of Homer, "Il." xii. 209, following:<p>So pressed with hunger from the mountain's brow,<p>Descends a lion on the flocks below;<p>So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,<p>In sullen majesty and stern disdain:<p>In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,<p>And shepherds gall him with an iron war;<p>Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;<p>He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.<p>Pope<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The prophet Isaiah, who had heard and received what follows from the Lord, and therefore it might be depended upon; and they are words of grace and mercy, promising preservation and deliverance; and therefore it was a foolish thing to send to Egypt for help: <p>Like as the lion, and the young lion roaring on his prey; or "muttering", or "growling over his prey" (r); for the lion roars when he is hungry, and wants a prey, and not when he has got one; but when he has one, and is tearing it in pieces, and feeding upon it, he makes a lower noise, a growling one, especially when he apprehends anyone near to disturb him: <p>when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him; or, "a fulness of shepherds" (s); the whole posse of them, all that are in the towns and villages, or fields adjacent: who, when a lion has got a lamb or sheep out of the flock, are alarmed and called together, to deliver it, if possible, out of his hands; one not daring to venture, or being not sufficient to disturb him, or drive him away: or, "when a multitude of shepherds meet him" (t); with the prey in his jaws; or rather "call to him", make a noise, in hopes to frighten him, and cause him to drop his prey, that being all they can do, not daring to go near him; which sense is confirmed by what follows: <p>he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them; he will not leave and lose his prey, or flee from it or them, for the yell and confused noise they make; nor move at all the faster for them, not being in the least intimidated by them: <p>so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the hill thereof; that is, he shall come down from heaven by his angel, or in the display of his mighty power, and fight against the Assyrian army, in favour of his people, the inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem, and deliver them; and there will be no more withstanding him, or putting him off from his purpose, or preventing his good designs and resolutions, than the shepherds are able to divert a lion from his prey.

Compare with this truly Homeric simile <span class="ital">Il</span>. 18:161 f., 12:299 ff. It is unfortunate that so graphic an image should be thought capable of two diametrically opposite interpretations. According to many commentators it expresses Jehovah’s determination to defend Jerusalem against the Assyrians. But the figure would certainly be “ill-chosen” if the lion were represented as protecting his prey and the shepherds as anxious to destroy it. The only natural construction is that Jehovah (through the Assyrians, as in <a href="/context/isaiah/29-3.htm" title="And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you....">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>) will hold Jerusalem helpless in His power as the lion holds his prey; though the noisy crowd of shepherds (the Egyptians) try to scare him away.

In the promise of protection (vers. 4, 5) there is nothing new but the imagery, which is of remarkable beauty. The promise is followed by a brief exhortation (vers. 6, 7); and then the discomfiture of Assyria is declared in the plainest terms, and her flight before the avenging sword of God (vers. 8, 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as the lion</span>, etc. The resemblance of this simile to Hem., 'Iliad,' 18:11. 161, 162, has been often noticed. In both, the lion has seized his prey, and is crouching over it; the shepherds gather themselves together against him, and seek to scare him away; but he remains firm, undaunted by their threats and cries, never for a moment relinquishing the body of which he has made himself the master. The image is best explained as representing Jehovah, standing over and keeping guard on Jerusalem, which he will allow, no one to rend from him. <span class="cmt_word">And the young lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the young lion</span> (Lowth).

The words are a promise, not a threat. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Israel is marching in such a joyful way to a sacred and glorious height, whilst outside Jehovah is sweeping the world-power entirely away, and that without any help from Israel. "And Jehovah causes His majestic voice to be heard, and causes the lowering of His arm to be seen, with the snorting of wrath and the blazing of devouring fire, the bursting of a cloud, and pouring of rain and hailstones. For Asshur will be terrified at the voice of Jehovah, when He smites with the staff. And it will come to pass, every stroke of the rod of destiny, which Jehovah causes to fall upon Asshur, is dealt amidst the noise of drums and the playing of guitars; and in battles of swinging arm He fights it. For a place for the sacrifice of abominations has long been made ready, even for the king is it prepared; deep, broad has He made it: its funeral-pile has fire and wood in abundance; the breath of Jehovah like a stream of brimstone sets it on fire." The imposing crash (on ho&#772;d, see <a href="/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>) of the cry which Jehovah causes to be heard is thunder (see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>); for the catastrophe occurs with a discharge of all the destructive forces of a storm (see <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>). Nephets is the "breaking up" or "bursting," viz., of a cloud. It is through such wrath-announcing phenomena of nature that Jehovah manifests the otherwise invisible letting down of His arm to smite (nachath may possibly not be the derivative of nu&#772;a&#774;ch, "settling down," but of na&#770;chath, "the coming down," as in <a href="/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; just as shebheth in <a href="/2_samuel/23-7.htm">2 Samuel 23:7</a> is not derived from shu&#772;bh, but from sha&#770;bhath, to go to ruin). <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>, commencing with ki (for), explains the terrible nature of what occurs, from the object at which it is directed: Asshur is alarmed at the voice of Jehovah, and thoroughly goes to pieces. We must not render this, as the Targum does, "which smites with the rod," i.e., which bears itself so haughtily, so tyrannically (after <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>). The smiter here is Jehovah (lxx, Vulg., Luther); and basshe&#772;bhet yakkeh is either an attributive clause, or, better still, a circumstantial determining clause, eo virga percutiente. According to the accents, veha&#770;ya&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a> is introductory: "And it will come to pass, every stroke of the punishing rod falls (supply &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) with an accompaniment of drums and guitars" (the Beth is used to denote instrumental accompaniment, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-9.htm">Isaiah 24:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>, etc.) - namely, on the part of the people of Jerusalem, who have only to look on and rejoice in the approaching deliverance. Mu&#772;sa&#770;da&#770;h with matte&#772;h is a verbal substantive used as a genitive, "an appointment according to decree" (comp. ya&#770;sad in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>, and ya&#770;&#8219;ad in <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>). The fact that drums and guitars are heard along with every stroke, is explained in <a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a>: "Jehovah fights against Asshur with battles of swinging," i.e., not with darts or any other kind of weapon, but by swinging His arm incessantly, to smite Asshur without its being able to defend itself (cf., <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>). Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, which points back to Asshur, not to matteh, the keri has &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, which is not so harsh, since it is immediately preceded by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;. This cutting down of the Assyrians is accounted for in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>, (ki, for), from the fact that it had long ago been decreed that they should be burned as dead bodies. 'Ethmu&#772;l in contrast with ma&#770;cha&#770;r is the past: it has not happened today, but yesterday, i.e., as the predestination of God is referred to, "long ago." <p>Tophteh is the primary form of to&#772;pheth (from tu&#772;ph, not in the sense of the Neo-Persian ta&#770;ften, Zend. tap, to kindle or burn, from which comes tafedra, melting; but in the Semitic sense of vomiting or abhorring: see at <a href="/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>), the name of the abominable place where the sacrifices were offered to Moloch in the valley of Hinnom: a Tophet-like place. The word is variously treated as both a masculine and feminine, possibly because the place of abominable sacrifices is described first as ba&#770;ma&#770;h in <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>. In the clause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, the gam, which stands at the head, may be connected with lammelekh, "also for the king is it prepared" (see at <a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>); but in all probability lammelekh is a play upon lammolekh (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/18-2.htm">Leviticus 18:2</a>), "even this has been prepared for the Melekh," viz., the king of Asshur. Because he was to be burned there, together with his army, Jehovah had made this Tophet-like place very deep, so that it might have a far-reaching background, and very broad, so that in this respect also there might be room for many sacrifices. And their medu&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., their pile of wood (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-5.htm">Ezekiel 24:5</a>, from du&#772;r, Talm. dayye&#772;r, to lay round, to arrange, pile), has abundance of fire and wood (a hendiadys, like "cloud and smoke" in <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). Abundance of fire: for the breath of Jehovah, pouring upon the funeral pile like a stream of brimstone, sets it on fire. &#1489;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, not to burn up, but to set on fire. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; points back to tophteh, like the suffix of medura&#770;tha&#770;h.<p>(Note: So far as the form of the text is concerned, ko&#772;l has the disjunctive yethib before pashta, which occurs eleven times according to the Masora. Nevertheless the word is logically connected in the closest manner with what follows (comp. 'e&#772;th to&#772;rath in <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>). The a&#770;h of mu&#772;sa&#770;da&#770;h is rafatum pro mappicato, according to the Masora; in which case the suffix would refer to Asshur. In the place of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501; we also meet with &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501;, with this chethib and keri reversed; but the former, according to which &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;, has many examples to support it in the Masora. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; has kametz in correct MSS in half pause; whereas Kimchi (Michlol, 117b) regards it as a participle.) </body></html>
