Then, when they have cast away their idols, shall the Assyrian fall by the sword of an angel, who strikes more strongly than a mighty man, yet more secretly than a mean man.

It is not meant here literally that the sword would be used, but it is employed to denote that complete destruction would come upon them.<p>Not of a mighty man - The idea here is, that the army should not fall by the valor of a distinguished warrior, but that it should be done by the direct interposition of God (see <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>).<p>Of a mean man - Of a man of humble rank. His army shall not be slain by the hand of mortals.<p>But he shall flee - The Assyrian monarch escaped when his army was destroyed, and fled toward his own land; <a href="/isaiah/37-37.htm">Isaiah 37:37</a>.<p>From the sword - Margin, 'For fear of.' The Hebrew is 'From the face of the sword;' and the sense is, that he would flee in consequence of the destruction of his host, here represented as destroyed by the sword of Yahweh.<p>And his young men - The flower and strength of his army.<p>Shall be discomfited - Margin, 'For melting;' or 'tribute,' or 'tributary.'

The Hebrew word (&#1502;&#1505;  mas), derived probably from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;  ma&#770;sas, "to melt away, to dissolve") is most usually employed to denote a levy, fine, or tax - so called, says Taylor, because it wastes or exhausts the substance and strength of a people. The word is often used to denote that people become tributary, or vassals, as in <a href="/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-11.htm">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; compare <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a>. Probably it does not here mean that the strength of the Assyrian army would become literally tributary to the Jews, but that they would be as if they had been placed under a levy to them; their vigor and strength would melt away; as property and numbers do under taxation and tribute. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

After his warning had failed to prevent it, he wrestled with it in spirit, set before himself afresh the curse which would be its certain fruit, brought out and unfolded the consolation of believers that lay hidden in the curse, and did not rest till the cursed fruit, that had become a real thing, had been swallowed up by the promise, which was equally real. The situation of this fourth woe is just the same as that of the previous one. The alliance with Egypt is still in progress. "Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely upon horses, and put their trust in chariots, that there are many of them; and in horsemen, that there is a powerful multitude of them; and do not look up to the Holy One of Israel, and do not inquire for Jehovah! And yet He also is wise; thus then He brings evil, and sets not His words aside; and rises up against the house of miscreants, and against the help of evil-doers. And Egypt is man, and not God; and its horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah stretches out His hand, the helper stumbles, and he that is helped falls, and they all perish together." The expression "them that go down" (hayyo&#772;red&#305;&#772;m) does not imply that the going down was taking place just then for the first time. It is the participle of qualification, just as God is called &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;. &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; with Lamed of the object, as in <a href="/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>. The horses, chariots, and horsemen here, as those of Egypt, which Diodorus calls &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, on account of its soil being so suitable for cavalry (see Lepsius in Herzog's Cyclopaedia). The participle is combined in the finite verb. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, we also find the reading preferred by Norzi, of &#1506;&#1500; without Vav, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>). The perfects, &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; and &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488;, are used without any definite time, to denote that which was always wanting in them. The circumstantial clause, "whilst He is assuredly also wise," i.e., will bear comparison with their wisdom and that of Egypt, is a touching &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. It was not necessary to think very highly of Jehovah, in order to perceive the reprehensible and destructive character of their apostasy from Him. The fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; is used to indicate the inevitable consequence of their despising Him who is also wise. He will not set aside His threatening words, but carry them out. The house of miscreants is Judah (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>); and the help (abstr. pro concr., just as Jehovah is frequently called "my help," &#8219;ezra&#770;th&#305;&#772;, by the Psalmist) of evil-doers is Egypt, whose help has been sought by Judah. The latter is "man" ('a&#770;da&#770;m), and its horses "flesh" (ba&#770;sa&#770;r); whereas Jehovah is God (El) and spirit (ru&#772;a&#774;ch; see Psychol. p. 85). Hofmann expounds it correctly: "As ruuach has life in itself, it is opposed to the ba&#770;sa&#770;r, which is only rendered living through the ru&#772;a&#774;ch; and so El is opposed to the corporeal 'a&#770;da&#770;m, who needs the spirit in order to live at all." Thus have they preferred the help of the impotent and conditioned, to the help of the almighty and all-conditioning One. Jehovah, who is God and spirit, only requires to stretch out His hand (an anthropomorphism, by the side of which we find the rule for interpreting it); and the helpers, and those who are helped (i.e., according to the terms of the treaty, though not in reality), that is to say, both the source of the help and the object of help, are all cast into one heap together. </body></html>
