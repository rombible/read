But their worshippers cannot help them; both the idols and the idolaters are gone into captivity. Let not God's people be afraid of either. Those things from which ungodly men expect safety and happiness, will be found unable to save them from death and hell. The true God will never fail his worshippers. The history of the life of every believer is a kind of abstract of the history of Israel. Our spiritual life is upheld by his grace, as constantly as our natural life by his providence. And God will never leave them. The Author will be the Finisher of their well-being, when, by decays, they need help as much as in infancy. This promise to Israel, enfeebled and grown old as a nation, is applicable to every aged follower of Christ. When compassed about with infirmities, and perhaps those around begin to grow weary of you, yet I am He that I have promised to be, He that you would have me to be. I will bear you up; carry you on in your way, and carry you home at last. If we learn to trust in and love him, we need not be anxious about our remaining days or years; he will still provide for us and watch over us, both as the creatures of his power, and as new-created by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And even to your old age, I am he - Or rather, I am the same. I remain, unchangeably, with the same tenderness, the same affection, the same care. In this the care of God for his people surpasses that of the most tender parent, and the most kind nourisher of the young. The care of the parent naturally dies away as the child reaches manhood, and he is usually removed by death before the son or daughter that excited so much solicitude in infancy and childhood, reaches old age. But not so with God. His people are always the objects of his tender solicitude. Age does not make them less dependent, and experience only teaches them more and more their need of his sustaining grace. The argument here is, that he who had watched over the infancy of his people with so much solicitude, would not leave them in the exposures, and infirmities, and trials of the advanced years of their history. The doctrine is, first, that his people always need his protection and care; secondly, that he will never leave nor forsake them; thirdly, that he who is the God of infancy and childhood will be the God of age, and that he will not leave or forsake his people, who have been the objects of his care and affection in childhood, when they become old. For though this passage refers primarily to a people, or a community as such, yet I see no reason why the principle should not be regarded as applicable to those who are literally aged. They need the care of God no less than childhood does; and if they have walked in his ways in the vigor and strength of their life, he will not cast them off 'when they are old and gray-headed.' Hoary hairs, therefore, if 'found in the way of righteousness.' may trust in God; and the 'second childhood' of man may find him no less certainly a protector than the first. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. old age&#8212;As "your"&#8212;"you"&#8212;"you," are not in the Hebrew, the sentiment is more general than English Version, though of course it includes the Jews from the infancy to the more advanced age of their history (Isa 47:6).<p>I am he&#8212;that is, the same (Ps 102:27; Joh 8:24; Heb 13:8).<p>I will bear &#8230; carry&#8212;Not only do I not need to be borne and carried Myself, as the idols (Isa 46:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And that care and kindness which I have had for you from the beginning, I will continue to you to the end; never forsaking you, unless you wilfully and obstinately cast me off, as the Jews did when their Messiah came.

The first imperative is hortatory, the second promising (cf., <a href="/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a>): Jehovah desires both, viz., the conversion of all men to Himself; and through this their salvation, ad this His gracious will, which extends to all mankind, will not rest till its object has been fully accomplished. <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a> "By myself have I sworn, a word has gone out of a mouth of righteousness, and will not return, That to me every knee shall bend, every tongue swear." Swearing by Himself (see <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), God pledges what He swears with His own life (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>, "as I live"). Parallel to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; is the clause &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;. Here Rosenmller connects &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; together as if with a hyphen, in the sense of a truth-word (Jerome, justitiae verbum). But this is grammatically impossible, since it would require &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;; moreover, it is opposed both to the accents, and to the dagesh in the Daleth. Hitzig's rendering is a better one: "Truth (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;), a word that does not return," - the latter being taken as an explanatory permutative; but in that case we should require &#1500;&#1488; for &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, and tseda&#770;qa&#770;h is not used in the sense of truth anywhere else (compare tsadd&#305;&#772;q, however, in <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>). On the other hand, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; might be equivalent to &#1489;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; "in righteousness;" cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;), if it were not incomparably more natural to connect together &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; &#1502;&#1508;&#1497; as a genitive construction; though not in the sense in which &#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1508;&#1497; is used in post-biblical writings - namely, as equivalent to "out of the mouth of God" (see Buxtorf, Lex. Chald. Col. 385) - but rather in this way, that the mouth of God is described attributively as regulated in its words by His holy will (as "speaking righteousness, <a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>). A word has gone forth from this mouth of righteousness; and after it has once gone forth, it does not return without accomplishing its object (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). What follows is not so much a promising prediction (that every knee will bend to me), as a definitive declaration of will (that it shall or must bend to me). According to <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>, "to me" is to be regarded as carried forward, and so to be supplied after "shall swear" (the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; @85 &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, is false; that of Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, is correct; and in this case, as in others also, the Cod. Al. of the Sept. has been corrected from the New Testament quotations). </body></html>
