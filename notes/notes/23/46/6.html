How does the profuseness of idolaters shame the niggardliness of many who call themselves God's servants, but are for a religion which costs them nothing! The service of sin always costs a great deal. God puts it to them what senseless, helpless things idols are. Let, then, the Jews show themselves men, avoiding such abominations. Many Scripture prophecies, delivered long ago, are not yet fulfilled; but the fulfilling of some is an earnest that the rest will come to pass. Nothing can help more to make us easy, than to be assured that God will do all his pleasure. Even those who know not and mind not God's revealed will, are called and used to fulfil the counsels of his secret will. Heaven and earth shall pass away, sooner than one tittle of the word of God. Obstinate sinners are addressed. Such were far from acceptance, but they were summoned to hearken to the word of the Lord. The salvation of a sinner begins with a humble and contrite heart, that trembles at God's word, with godly sorrow working true repentance, and faith in his mercy, through the obedience unto death of our Divine Surety. Christ, as the Divine righteousness and salvation to his people, would come in the appointed time. His salvation abides in his church for all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They lavish gold - The word used here means properly to shake out; and then to pour out abundantly, or in a lavish manner. It is used in connection with the idea of squandering in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-21.htm">Proverbs 23:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-7.htm">Proverbs 28:7</a>. Here the idea is, that they spared no expense; they poured out gold as if it were vile and worthless, in order to make an idol. The design of this verse is, to show the superstition of those who were idolaters; and, particularly, how much they were willing to devote in order to maintain idol-worship.<p>Out of the bag - They pour their gold out of the bag, or purse, where they have kept it; that is, they lavish it freely.<p>And weigh silver in the balance - Perhaps the idea is here, that they used silver so lavishly that they did not wait to count it, but weighed it as they would the grosser metals. The word used here and translated 'balance' (&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;  qa&#770;neh), means properly "cane, reed, calamus"; then a measuring reed or rod <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; then a rod, or beam of a balance, or scales (Greek &#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  zugos).<p>And hire a goldsmith - (See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a>).<p>And he maketh it a god - The goldsmith manufactures the gold and the silver into an image. The object of the prophet is to deride the custom of offering divine homage to a god formed in this manner (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-19</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. (Isa 40:19, 20; 41:7.) They lavish gold out of their purses and spare no expense for their idol. Their profuseness shames the niggardliness of professors who worship God with what cost them nothing.

As if it was of no value and account; that is, the Heathen idolaters, some of them, who are excessively devoted to idolatry; these, being rich, take out their bags of gold, and give it in a very profuse manner to a workman to make a golden image for them, not caring what it cost them; such an one was that which Nebuchadnezzar made, sixty cubits high, and six broad, <a href="/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1</a> see an instance of profuseness this way in the Israelites themselves, <a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>. <p>And weigh silver in the balance; or "with a reed" (o). Others, though idolaters, yet less devoted to idolatry, and more tenacious of their money, make silver do for a god, and weigh it out to the workman, that it be made of such a weight, and no more, and that they might not be cheated of their silver; or they weighed it to pay the workman for his workmanship. Money formerly was not coined and stamped, so not numbered by pieces, but weighed. <p>And hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; a "finer" or "founder", with whom they agree for such a sum of money, and he, of the gold or silver that is put into his hands, makes a god: he casts and moulds it into such a form or shape that is agreed upon, and this is called a god; though nothing but a piece of gold or silver fashioned by art and man's device, and the work of his hands: <p>they fall down, yea, they worship; the god they made; both the artificer, and he that employed him, fall down upon their knees, or their faces, and pay divine worship add adoration to the idol; though the one knew it was made of his own gold or silver, and the other knew it to be the workmanship of his hands. Worshipping is more than falling down, as Ben Melech observes, and therefore it is said, yea, they worship. <p>(o) "in calamo", Pagninus, Montanus. The bar of the balance on which they hang the scales with threads, Ben Meleck says is called  the "reed".

The parenthetical insertion of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497; &#1500;, with reference to, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) is the same as in <a href="/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>. &#1488;&#1498; has a restrictive sense here, which springs out of the affirmative (cf., <a href="/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>), just as, in the case of raq, the affirmative grows out of the primary restrictive sense.

They separate themselves irretrievably from the men who serve Him, the restoration of whom is His direct will, and the goal of the history of salvation. <a href="/isaiah/45-25.htm">Isaiah 45:25</a> "In Jehovah all the seed of Israel shall become righteous, and shall glory." Ruetschi has very properly observed on this verse, that the reference is to the Israel of God out of all the human race, i.e., the church of the believers in Israel expanded by the addition of the heathen; which church is now righteous, i.e., reconciled and renewed by Jehovah, and glories in Him, because by grace it is what it is. <p>This brings the sixth prophecy to a close. Its five strophes commence with "Thus saith the Lord;" at the same time, the fifth strophe has two "woes" (hoi) before this, as the ground upon which it rests. </body></html>
