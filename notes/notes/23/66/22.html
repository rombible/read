This is described in expressions suited to the Old Testament dispensation, to show that, though the ceremonial law should be abolished, and the temple service at an end, yet God should be still as regularly, statedly, and acceptedly worshipped as ever. Heretofore the Jews were only obliged to appear three times in a year at the place of God’s public worship, but, saith the prophet, in the gospel church people shall worship <span class="ital">from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another — </span>They shall be perpetually employed in serving and glorifying him, although in different ways. Their state shall be one continued festival. And whereas, under the former dispensation, the Jews only were bound to attend God’s worship at the great feasts, and of them only the males; now, under the new dispensation, all flesh, Gentiles as well as Jews, women as well as men, shall <span class="ital">come and worship before God </span>— That is, shall worship in his presence, though not in his temple at Jerusalem, but in religious assemblies dispersed all over the world, which shall be to them as the <span class="ital">tabernacle of meeting </span>was to the Jews: God will in them record his name; and, though but two or three come together, he will <span class="ital">be in the midst of them, </span>will meet and bless them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>66:19,20, set forth the abundance of means for conversion of sinners. These expressions are figurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringing God's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shall be set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before the Lord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in the world to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked be separated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery and torment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour of that free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of the Lord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphant songs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of the righteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race, Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, that our portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave to his truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive from the Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For as the new heavens and the new earth - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>).<p>Shall remain before me - They shall not pass away and be succeeded by others.

"For in the midst of fire Jehovah holds judgment, and in the midst of His sword with all flesh; and great will be the multitude of those pierced through by Jehovah." The fire, which is here introduced as the medium of judgment, points to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. At the same time all the emphasis is laid here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), upon the direct action of Jehovah Himself. The parallelism in <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a> is progressive. Nishpat 'e&#772;th, "to go into judgment with a person," as in <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a> (cf., &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>, <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-8.htm">2 Chronicles 22:8</a>; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31-32</a>).
