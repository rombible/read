These expressions are figurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringing God's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shall be set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before the Lord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in the world to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked be separated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery and torment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour of that free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of the Lord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphant songs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of the righteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race, Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, that our portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave to his truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive from the Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will also take of them for priests - I will give to them an honorable place in my public service; that is, I will make them ministers of religion as if they were priests and Levites. This cannot be taken literally - because the priests and Levites among the Jews were determined by law, and by regular genealogical descent, and there was no provision for substituting any in their place. But it must mean that under the condition of things described here, those who should be brought from the distant pagan world would perform the same offices in the service of God which had been performed formerly by the priests and Levites that is, they would be ministers of religion. The services of God would no longer be performed by the descendants of Aaron, or be limited to them, but would be performed by others who should be called to this office from the pagan world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. of them&#8212;the Gentiles.<p>priests &#8230; Levites&#8212;for spiritual worship: enjoying the direct access to God which was formerly enjoyed by the ministers of the temple alone (1Pe 2:9; Re 1:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Lest the Jews, being assured that the tribe of Levi, which God anciently chose to minister before him, was among them, should say, Alas, if the Gentiles should be brought in, where would they have priests or Levites?

That is, of the Gentiles, the brethren brought as an offering to the Lord; and therefore must respect Gospel times, when the Aaronic priesthood would be changed and cease, which admitted not of Gentiles, nor any of any other tribe in Israel, but the tribe of Levi; nor is this to be understood of the spiritual priesthood common to all believers, <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a> since of those converted Gentiles brought, not all, but only some of them, would be taken for priests; and therefore can only be interpreted of the ministers of the word, who, in Old Testament language, are called priests, though never in the New Testament; but elders, bishops, overseers, pastors, and teachers. The first preachers of the Gospel were Jews, as the twelve apostles, the seventy disciples, Paul and Barnabas, and others; but when the Gospel was preached, and churches planted in the Gentile world, then priests, or pastors, or elders, were taken out from among them, and ordained over the churches everywhere; and which have continued, more or less, ever since; and will be more abundant in the latter day; whose work and office is not to offer up slain beasts, as the priests of old; but to point to the sacrifice of Christ, to the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of men; and to teach the knowledge of crucified Christ, and the several doctrines and duties of the Christian religion, as the priests formerly taught the knowledge of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>, <p>and for Levites, saith the Lord; this still more clearly shows that the prophecy belongs to the Gospel dispensation, and is to be understood figuratively and spiritually; for none but those of the tribe of Levi could be taken for Levites in a literal sense; but here Gentiles are said to be taken for such, and design men in Gospel churches. The Levites, as their name signifies, were such as were "joined" to others; they ministered to the priests, and assisted them, and had the charge of the temple, and the vessels of it, to whom deacons now answer; who are helps and assistants to the ministers of the word: their business is to serve tables, and to take care of the secular affairs of the church; so that this is a prophecy of the churches in the latter day being truly organized, and filled with proper officers, as well as with numerous members. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/66.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will also take of them for <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> priests <i>and</i> for Levites, saith the LORD.</span><p>(h) That is, of the Gentiles, as he did Luke, Timothy and Titus first, and others after to preach his word.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/66.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>.<span class="bld"> And of them also will I take</span> &c. (R.V.). Commentators differ in opinion as to whether the ministers of the sanctuary are to be taken from the restored exiles or from the Gentiles who bring them back; the language is consistent with either supposition. The latter is thought by some to be excluded by <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a> f.

These considerations, however, are not decisive; and the emphasis of the statement is perhaps better explained by the bolder conception. In any case the prophet seems to contemplate a suspension of the provisions of the Law, for the words “I will take” suggest something more than that those who are priests and Levites by birth shall be permitted to exercise their hereditary functions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for priests</span> and <span class="ital">for Levites</span>] Strictly, “for the priests, for the Levites,” implying that they were to be given for the service of the priests and Levites. But the article should probably be omitted, and the rendering of E.V. retained. The conjunction “and” is supplied by all the Versions and some MSS. The duplication of the preposition distinguishes the expression from a characteristic phrase of Deuteronomy (see Driver on <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm" title="The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>), so that we cannot (without a change of text) render “for Levitical priests.” Nothing would be gained by such an alteration, for the adj. “Levitical” in this connexion would be a meaningless addition.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will also take of them for priests and</span> <span class="cmt_word">for Levites;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and I will also take of them unto the priests and unto the Levites</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will add to the existing body of priests and Levites, who are pro-sumably Jews, fresh members from the newly converted Gentiles. The existence of a sacerdotal order, with distinctions of ranks, in the Church of the redeemed, is implied, and the gracious declaration is made that the privilege of furnishing members to both ranks of the order shall be conferred upon the Gentile proselytes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/66.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy now takes a new turn with the thought expressed in the words, "and fiercely does He treat His enemies." The judgment of wrath, which prepares the way for the redemption and ensures its continuance, is described more minutely in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a> : "For behold Jehovah, in the fire will He come, and His chariots are like the whirlwind, to pay out His wrath in burning heat, and His threatening passeth into flames of fire." Jehovah comes ba&#770;'e&#772;sh, in igne (Jerome; the lxx, on the contrary, render it arbitrarily &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1; ka&#770;'e&#772;sh), since it is the fiery side of His glory, in which He appears, and fire pours from Him, which is primarily the intense excitement of the powers of destruction within God Himself (<a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>), and in these is transformed into cosmical powers of destruction (<a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>). He is compared to a warrior, driving along upon war-chariots resembling stormy wind, which force everything out of their way, and crush to pieces whatever comes under their wheels. The plural &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; (His chariots) is probably not merely amplifying, but a strict plural; for Jehovah, the One, can manifest Himself in love or wrath in different places at the same time. The very same substantive clause &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1499;&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492; occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>, where it is not used of Jehovah, however, but of the Chaldeans. Observe also that Jeremiah there proceeds immediately with a derivative passage from <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. In the following clause denoting the object, &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, we must not adopt the rendering, "to breathe out His wrath in burning heat" (Hitzig), for he&#772;sh&#305;&#772;bh may mean respirare, but not exspirare (if this were the meaning, it would be better to read &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, as Lowth does); nor "ut iram suam furore sedet" (Meier), for even in <a href="/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>, &#1506;&#1508;&#1493; &#1492;&#1513;&#1497;&#1489; does not mean to still or cool His wrath, but to turn it away or take it back; not even "to direct His wrath in burning heat" (Ges., Kn.), for in this sense he&#772;sh&#305;&#772;bh would be connected with an object with &#1500;, &#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/job/15-13.htm">Job 15:13</a>), &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>). It has rather the meaning reddere in the sense of retribuere (Arab. atha&#770;ba, syn. shille&#772;m), and "to pay back, or pay out, His wrath" is equivalent to he&#772;sh&#305;&#772;bh na&#770;qa&#770;m (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>), Hence &#1506;&#1508;&#1493; &#1489;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; does not stand in a permutative relation instead of a genitive one (viz., in fervore, ria&#770; sua&#770;  equals  irae suae), but is an adverbial definition, just as in <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>. That the payment of the wrath deserved takes place in burning heat, and His rebuke (ge&#8219;a&#770;ra&#770;h) in flames of fire, are thoughts that answer to one another.  </body></html>
