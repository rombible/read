The thought of a “remnant” to be saved is still characteristically dominant, and that “remnant” is to act as heralds of Jehovah to the far-distant nations who had not been sharers in any open antagonism to Israel, and who were, therefore, not involved in the great judgment.

These expressions are figurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringing God's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shall be set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before the Lord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in the world to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked be separated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery and torment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour of that free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of the Lord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphant songs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of the righteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race, Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, that our portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave to his truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive from the Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will set a sign among them - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>). On the meaning of the word 'sign' (&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  'o&#770;th), see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>. What is its meaning here is to be determined by the connection. That would seem to me to require some such interpretation as this: That when God should come <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17-18</a> to take vengeance on his foes, and to manifest his glory, he would establish some mark or memorial; would erect some standard, or give some signal, by which his true friends would escape, and that he would send them to distant nations to proclaim his truth and gather together those who had not seen his glory. What that sign should be, he does not here say. Whether a standard, a secret communication, or some intimation beforehand, by which they should know the approaching danger and make their escape, is not declared. It is by no means easy to determine with certainty on this passage; and it certainly becomes no one to speak dogmatically or very confidently.<p>But it seems to me that the whole passage may have been intended, by the Holy Spirit, to refer to the propagation of the gospel by the apostles. The heavy judgments referred to may have been the impending calamities over Jerusalem. The glory of God referred to, may have been the signal manifestation of his perfections at that period in the approaching destruction of the city, and in the wonders that attended the coming of the Messiah. The gathering of the nations <a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a> may possibly refer to the collecting together of numerous people from all parts of the earth about that time; that is, either the assembled people at the time of the Saviour's death <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>, or the gathering of the armies of the Romans - a commingled multitude from all nations - to inflict punishment on the Jewish nation, and to behold the manifestation of the divine justice in the destruction of the guilty Jewish capital.<p>The 'sign' here referred to, may denote the intimations which the Redeemer gave to his disciples to discern these approaching calamities, and to secure their safety by flight when they should be about to appear <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15-18</a>. By these warnings and previous intimations they were to be preserved. The sign was 'among them,' that is, in the very midst of the nation; and the object of the intimation was, to secure their safety, and the speedy propagation of the true religion among all nations. Deeply sensible that there is great danger of erring here, and that the above view may be viewed as mere conjecture, I cannot, however, help regarding it as the true exposition. If there is error in it, it may be pardoned, for it will probably be felt by most readers of these notes that there has not been a too frequent reference in the interpretation proposed to the times of the Christian dispensation.<p>And I will send those that escape of them - According to the interpretation suggested above, this refers to the portion of the Jewish nation that should escape from the tokens of the divine displeasure; that is, to the apostles and the early disciples of the Redeemer. The great mass of the nation would be abandoned and devoted to destruction. But a remnant would be saved (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>). Of that remnant, God would send a portion to make his name known to those who had not heard it, and they would lead distant nations to the knowledge of his truth. The whole passage is so accurately descriptive of what occurred in the times when the gospel was first preached to the pagan world, that there can be little danger of error in referring it to those times. Compare Vitringa on the passage for a more full view of the reasons of this interpretation. The names of the places which follow are designed to specify the principal places where the message would be sent, and stand here as representatives of the whole pagan world.<p>To Tarshish - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). Tarshish was one of the most distant seaports known to the Hebrews; and whether it be regarded as situated in Spain, or in the East Indies, or south of Abyssinia (see the notes above) it equally denotes a distant place, and the passage means that the message would be borne to the most remote regions.<p>Pul - This is supposed to denote some region in Africa. Jerome renders it, 'Africa.' The Septuagint, &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3b4;  Foud - 'Phud.' Bochart, Phaleg. iv. 26, supposes that it means Philae, a large island in the Nile, between Egypt and Ethiopia; called by the Egyptians Pilak, i e., the border, or far country (see Champollion, l'Egypte, i. 158). There are still on that island remains of some very noble and extensive temples built by the ancient Egyptians.<p>And Lud - Jerome renders this, 'Lydia.' The Septuagint 'Lud.' There was a Lydia in Asia Minor - the kingdom of the celebrated Croesus; but it is generally supposed that this place was in Africa. Ludim was a son of Mizraim <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>, and the name Ludim, or Lybians, referring to a people, several times occurs in the Bible <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>. These African Lybians are commonly mentioned in connection with Pul, Ethiopia, and Phut. Bochart supposes that Abyssinia is intended, but it is by no means certain that this is the place referred to. Josephus affirms that the descendants of Ludim are long since extinct, having been destroyed in the Ethiopian wars. It is clear that some part of Egypt is intended, says Calmer, but it is not easy to show exactly where they dwelt.<p>That draw the bow - (&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;  mosheke&#772;y qeshet). The Septuagint here renders the Hebrew phrase simply by &#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c7;  Mosoch,' understanding it of a place. Lowth supposes that the Hebrew phrase is a corruption of the word Moschi, the name of a nation situated between the Euxine and the Caspian seas. But there is no authority for supposing, as he does, that the word 'bow' has been interpolated. The Chaldee renders it, 'Drawing and smiting with the bow.' The idea is, that the nations here referred to were distinguished for the use of thw bow. The bow was in common use in wars; and it is by no means improbable that at that time they had acquired special fame in the use of this weapon.<p>To Tubal - Tubal was the fifth son of Japhet, and is here joined with Javan because they were among the settlers of Europe. The names before mentioned together relate to Africa, and the sense there is, that the message should be sent to Africa; here the idea is, that it should be sent to Europe. Tubal is commonly united with Meshech, and it is supposed that they populated countries bordering on each other. Bochart labors to prove that by Meshech and Tubal are intended the Muscovites and the Tibarenians. The Tibarenians of the Greeks were the people inhabiting the country south of the Caucasus, between the Black Sea and the Araxes. Josephus says, that 'Tubal obtained the Thobelians (&#x398;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  Tho&#772;be&#772;lous) who are reckoned among the Iberians.' Jerome renders it, 'Italy.' It is not possible to determine with certainty the country that is referred to, though some part of Europe is doubtless intended.<p>And Javan - Jerome renders this, 'Greece.' So the Septuagint, &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x395;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;  Eis te&#772;n Hellada - 'To Greece.' Javan was the fourth son of Japhet, and was the father of the Ionians and the Greeks <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-4</a>. The word 'Ionia,' Greek &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Io&#772;n, &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  Io&#772;nia, is evidently derived from the word rendered here 'Javan' (&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  ya&#770;va&#770;n), and in the Scriptures the word comprehends all the countries inhabited by the descendants of Javan, as well in Greece as in Asia Minor. Ionia properly was the beautiful province on the western part of Asia Minor - a country much celebrated in the Greek classics for its fertility and the salubrity of its climate - but the word used here includes all of Greece. Thus Daniel Dan 11:2, speaking of Xerxes, says, 'He shall stir up all against the realm of Javan.' Alexander the Great is descried by the same prophet as 'king of Javan' <a href="/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-20.htm">Daniel 10:20</a>. The Hindus call the Greeks Yavanas - the ancient Hebrew appellation. It is needless to say, on the supposition that this refers to the propagation of the gospel by the apostles, that it was fulfilled. They went to Greece and to Asia Minor in the very commencement of their labors, and seme of the earliest and most flourishing churches were founded in the lands that were settled by the descendants of Javan.<p>To the isles afar off - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>).<p>That have not heard my fame - Hebrew, 'Who have not heard my report,' that is, who were ignorant of the true God.<p>Neither have seen my glory - The glory which he had manifested to the Hebrews in giving his law, and in the various exhibitions of his character and perfections among them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. sign&#8212;a banner on a high place, to indicate the place of meeting for the dispersed Jewish exiles, preparatory to their return to their land (Isa 5:26; 11:12; 62:10).<p>those that escape of them&#8212;the Gentile survivors spared by God (see on [888]Isa 66:18; Zec 14:16).

The LXX. reads <span class="greekheb">Μόσοχ</span> (Meshech). This is attractive, because of the resemblance to <span class="ital">môshěkê</span> (drawing), and because Meshech and Tubal are nearly always associated (<a href="/genesis/10-2.htm" title="The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.">Genesis 10:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm" title="There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.">Ezekiel 32:26</a>, &c.). They are the Moschi and Tibareni of classical writers, the Muski and Tabal of the Assyrian monuments, tribes lying south and south-east of the Black Sea (Schrader, <span class="ital">Cun. Inscr.</span> pp. 82, 84). If the reading of the LXX. be adopted it will be necessary to find an equivalent for <span class="ital">qésheth</span> (bow); and Duhm suggests <span class="ital">Rosh</span> from <a href="/ezekiel/38-1.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 38:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-1.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:">Ezekiel 39:1</a> (see Davidson’s Note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Javan</span> (= <span class="greekheb">Ἰάϝων</span>) the Ionians, is the Hebrew name for the Greek race.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the isles</span> (<span class="bld">coastlands</span>, ch. <a href="/isaiah/40-15.htm" title="Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.">Isaiah 40:15</a>) <span class="ital">afar off, that have not heard my fame &c.</span>] This distinction between the nearer nations who have experienced something of the greatness of Jehovah, through contact with His people Israel, and the remoter nations who have not heard His name, originates with the prophet Ezekiel. It underlies the conception of the invasion of Gog’s host and its destruction as described in ch. 38 f. Gog is the leader and representative of the outlying nations of the earth, and the demonstration of Jehovah’s power against them falls at a time subsequent to the peaceful settlement of Israel in its own land, and long after judgement has been executed on the neighbouring states <span class="bld">which had</span> been in contact with Israel throughout its history (see Davidson, <span class="ital">Camb. Bible, Ezekiel</span>, pp. 273 ff.). But while the distinction is common to the two prophets, the development of the idea is strikingly different. In Ezekiel Gog’s ignorance of Jehovah tempts him to an act of sacrilege on the land of Israel, which is avenged by the annihilation of him and his host. The spirit of this passage is more evangelical. Jehovah sends missionaries from the nearer nations to those who have not heard His fame nor seen His glory; and the report carries conviction to their minds, so that they restore the Israelites exiled amongst them, as an offering to the Lord.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-24.</span> - THE FINAL CONDITION OF THE CHURCH OF THE REDEEMED ON EARTH. When the enemies of God have been consumed, there shall go out from the Church missionaries, who shall convert the distant Gentiles, and unite them, and the Jews who dwell among them, into a single body of   worshippers, which shall inhabit the new Jerusalem on equal terms, and join continually in a common worship of Jehovah. The awful destruction of the wicked, and their eternal sufferings, shall at the same time be held in remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">I will set a sign among them.</span> Dr. Kay suggests that the "sign" is the resurrection of our Lord, or possibly a miraculous manifestation of Christ which is to precede his coming in judgment. Mr. Cheyne, less venturesome, finds in the prophet's words merely a suggestion of "some mysterious event, which he leaves his awestruck readers to imagine." <span class="cmt_word">Those that escape of them</span>. Not, surely, those of God's enemies that survive the slaughter, but "the remnant" of Jews, that are not among God's enemies, and so "escape." These shall be sent (as missionaries) to the distant nations; not literally to those enumerated, but to such as at the end of the world occupy a position which the nations mentioned occupied on Isaiah's horizon. Of these nations, Tarshish (Tartessus) was at the furthest limit westward, Pul and Lud, or rather Phut and Lud, at the furthest limit southward, Tubal and Javan at the furthest limit northward, Pul, which occurs nowhere else in Scripture as a geographic name, is almost certainly a wrong reading for Phut, which occurs in <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, and also three times (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>) in connection with Lud. Phut designates an African nation, probably the Nubians, whom the Egyptians called Pet, and who were noted as bowmen. Wetstein's conjecture of "Pun" (Punici, 'Phoenicians '), commended by Mr. Cheyne, is quite unsupported and highly improbable. Lud. It is tempting to connect "Lud" with the Lydians, who were certainly known as "<span class="accented">Lndi"</span> to the Assyrians of the time of Asshur-bani-pal (B.C. 669-626). But the other scriptural notices of "Lud" (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), which uniformly connect it with Phut, point rather to an African people. See also <a href="/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>, where the Ludim are a subdivision of the Egyptians. <span class="cmt_word">That draw the bow</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>). To <span class="cmt_word">Tubal</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>. Tubal stands, no doubt, for the Tibareni, a people of the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, called <span class="accented">Tuplai</span> or <span class="accented">Tabali</span> by the Assyrians. They would occupy Isaiah's northern and north-western horizon, in company with Javan, or the Ionians (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), who were among the chief people of Asia Minor. Javan, Tubal, and Mesheeh (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Muskai) are joined in <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The isles</span> <span class="cmt_word">afar off</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shores and islands of the Mediterranean. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/66.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet now looks upon the members of the church as having grown up, as it were, from childhood to maturity: they suck like a child, and are comforted like a grown-up son. "Like a man whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem." Hitzig says that '&#305;&#772;sh is not well chosen; but how easily could the prophet have written be&#772;n (son), as in <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>! He writes '&#305;&#772;sh, however, not indeed in the unmeaning sense in which the lxx has taken it, viz., &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, but looking upon the people, whom he had previously thought of as children, as standing before him as one man. Israel is now like a man who has escaped from bondage and returned home from a foreign land, full of mournful recollections, the echoing sounds of which entirely disappear in the maternal arms of divine love there in Jerusalem, the beloved home, which was the home of its thoughts even in the strange land. </body></html>
