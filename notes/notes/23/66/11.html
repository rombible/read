The friends who visit the rejoicing mother are invited to take their place with the new-born child, and to share his nurture.

The Lord will appear, to the joy of the humble believer, and to the confusion of hypocrites and persecutors. When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel went forth from Zion, multitudes were converted in a little time. The word of God, especially his promises, and ordinances, are the consolations of the church. The true happiness of all Christians is increased by every convert brought to Christ. The gospel brings with it, wherever it is received in its power, such a river of peace, as will carry us to the ocean of boundless and endless bliss. Divine comforts reach the inward man; the joy of the Lord will be the strength of the believer.

See the note at those places.<p>That ye may milk out - The image is an obvious one. It means that they who sympathized with Zion would be nourished by the same truth, and comforted with the same sources of consolation.<p>And be delighted with the abundance of her glory - Margin, 'Brightness.' Lowth renders this, 'From her abundant stores.' Noyes, 'From the fullness of her glory.' Jerome (the Vulgate), 'And that you may abound with delights from every kind of her glory.' The Septuagint, 'That sucking ye may be nourished from the commencement' (Thompson); 'or the entrance of her glory' (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  apo eisodou doxe&#772;s aute&#772;s). This variety of interpretation has arisen from the uncertain meaning of the word &#1494;&#1497;&#1494;  z&#305;&#770;yz, rendered 'abundance.' Gesenius supposes that it is derived from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;  zu&#770;z, meaning:<p>1. To move;<p>2. To glance, to sparkle, to radiate, from the idea of rapid motion; hence, to flow out like rays, to spout like milk; and hence, the noun &#1494;&#1497;&#1494;  z&#305;&#770;yz, means a breast.<p>This derivation may be regarded as somewhat fanciful; but it will show why the word 'brightness' was inserted in the margin, since one of the usual significations of the verb relates to brightness, or to sparkling rays. Aquila renders it, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  Apo pantodapias - 'From every kind of abundance.'

The word probably refers to the abundance of the consolations which Zion possessed. Lowth proposes to change the text; but without any authority. The Chaldee renders it, 'That ye may drink of the wine of her glory;' where they probably read &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;  yayin ("wine"), instead of the present reading.<p>Of her glory - The abundant favors or blessings conferred on Zion. The glory that should be manifested to her would be the knowledge of divine truth, and the provisions made for the salvation of people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. suck&#8212;(Isa 60:5, 16; 61:6; 49:23).<p>abundance&#8212;Hebrew, "the ray-like flow of her opulence," that is, with the milk spouting out from her full breasts (answering to the parallel, "breast of her consolations") in ray-like streams [Gesenius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Jerusalem is here set out as the mother of us all, as indeed she was; for <span class="ital">out of Zion</span> went <span class="ital">forth the law</span>, and <span class="ital">the word of the Lord from Jerusalem</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a></span>.

This, according to our version, expresses the end of the church's friends being called together to rejoice with her, that they might partake of her joys and comforts, delights and pleasures: but the words may be better rendered, either, according to Kimchi's sense, "therefore shall ye suck" (t), &amp;c.; because ye have mourned for her, and because ye have rejoiced with her; or rather, as Noldius (u), "because ye suck", &amp;c.; partake of her privileges and ordinances, so give a reason why they should rejoice with her. "Breast" is put for "breasts", as Jarchi observes; for as the church is represented as a woman, and as a teeming woman, she has two breasts as such, grown and fashioned, and full of milk of consolation; for "breast of her consolations" is the same as "her breasts of consolation"; see Sol 4:5, these are either Christ and his Spirit. Christ is a full breast of comfort to his people, in the greatness of his person, and the riches of his grace; in his precious blood, perfect righteousness, atoning sacrifice, and great salvation; if there be any comfort it is in him, and abounds by him. The Holy Spirit is another breast of consolation, another Comforter, by giving knowledge of the free grace gifts of God; by showing the things of Christ; by opening and applying the precious promises of the Gospel; by shedding the love of God in the heart; by witnessing to the saints their adoption, and by sealing them up unto the day of redemption. Or the covenant, and its blessings and promises: the covenant is a full breast of comfort, yields much both in life and at death; its blessings are sure mercies, blessings indeed, spiritual ones, and he that has an interest in them has enough, has all things; the promises of it are great, precious, sure, and unconditional, and afford strong consolation to the heirs of them. Or the Holy Scripture, and its two Testaments, the Old and New, which are exactly alike as two breasts; agree in the person and offices of Christ, and in all the doctrines of grace, and are full of the sincere milk of the word, and of spiritual consolation. Or the two ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper; which agree with each other; come from the same author; relate to the same things, the sufferings and death of Christ; and to be partook of by the same persons: baptism leads to the blood of Christ for cleansing and pardon; to the burial of Christ it represents, there to behold all sins buried with him; and to the resurrection of Christ for justification, and so is a means of much spiritual comfort; as it was to the eunuch, who from thence went on his way rejoicing: the Lord's supper is another breast of consolation, it is a feast of fat things; it represents the broken body and bloodshed of Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, and so is a means of spiritual nourishment and comfort. These breasts are to be "sucked"; the mouth of faith is to be laid unto them; Christ is to be applied unto for fresh supplies of grace and comfort; the covenant and its promises are to be laid hold upon, and all the goodness in them to be pressed and got out; the Scriptures are to be diligently read and searched, and the ordinances to be frequently attended on, and fervent prayer to be incessantly used, and not restrained till the blessing is given; and such who do so are sooner or later "satisfied", filled to the full. How satisfying are Christ and his grace! the covenant of grace, its blessing and promises! the doctrine of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it! these are the goodness of God's house, with which his people are satisfied, even as with marrow and fatness, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>, <p>that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory; or, "for" or "because ye milk out", "may" or "shall milk out" (w); that is, press with the hand of faith the above breasts of consolation, and get out from them all the comfort that is laid up in them: and so <p>be delighted with the abundance of her glory; or, "the brightness of it" (x); Christ is the glory of his church; it is his presence with her, his grace and righteousness bestowed on her, which give her abundance of glory; and he it is in whom she glories: the Spirit of God, as a spirit of glory, rests upon her, and his grace makes her all glorious within; it is her glory to be interested in the covenant of grace, its promises and blessings, and to have the word and ordinances; her breasts are her glory, and she will have abundance of it in the latter day; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, all which greatly "delight" the lovers and friends of Zion; a sight of Christ and his fulness, and a view of God as their Covenant God, are exceeding delightful; the doctrines of the Gospel are pleasant words, and the ways or ordinances of Christ are ways of pleasantness; and particularly the church in the latter day, enjoying all these to the full, and having the glory of God upon her, will be very delightful to behold. <p>(t)  "pro eo quod, vel quia sugetis", Gataker.

They are called to hear how Jehovah will accept them in defiance of their persecutors. "Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at His word: your brethren that hate you, that thrust you from them for my name's sake, say, 'Let Jehovah get honour, that we may see your joy:' they will be put to shame." They that hate them are their own brethren, and (what makes the sin still greater) the name of Jehovah is the reason why they are hated by them. According to the accents, indeed (&#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; rebia, &#1505;&#1502;&#1497; pashta), the meaning would be, "your brethren say ...  'for my name's sake (i.e., for me  equals  out of goodness and love to us) will Jehovah glorify Himself,' - then we shall see your joy, but - they will be put to shame." Rashi and other Jewish expositors interpret it in this or some similar way; but Rosenmller, Stier, and Hahn are the only modern Christian expositors, who have done so, following the precedent of earlier commentators, who regarded the accents as binding. Luther, however, very properly disregarded them. If &#1505;&#1502;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; be taken in connection with &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1491;, it gives only a forced sense, which disturbs the relation of all the clauses; whereas this is preserved in all respects in the most natural and connected manner if we combine &#1513;&#1502;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; with &#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, as we must do, according to such parallels as <a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1504;&#1512;, to scare away or thrust away (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>, with the object in the dative), corresponds to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in <a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a> (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>, "to put out of the synagogue"). The practice of excommunication, or putting under the ban (niddu&#772;i), reaches beyond the period of the Herodians (see Eduyoth v. 6),<p>(Note: Compare Wiesner: Der Bann in seiner gesch. Entwickelung auf dem Boden des Judenthums, 1864.)<p>at any rate as far back as the times succeeding the captivity; but in the passage before us it is quite sufficient to understand nidda&#770;h in the sense of a defamatory renunciation of fellowship. To the accentuators this &#1513;&#1502;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; appeared quite unintelligible. They never considered that it had a confessional sense here, which certainly does not occur anywhere else: viz., "for my name's sake, which ye confess in word and deed." With unbelieving scorn they say to those who confess Jehovah, and believe in the word of the true redemption: Let Jehovah glorify Himself (lit. let Him be, i.e., show Himself, glorious  equals  yikka&#770;be&#772;d, cf., <a href="/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>), that we may thoroughly satisfy ourselves with looking at your joy. They regard their hope as deceptive, and the word of the prophet as fanaticism. These are they, who, when permission to return is suddenly given, will desire to accompany them, but will be disappointed, because they did not rejoice in faith before, and because, although they do now rejoice in that which is self-evident, they do this in a wrong way. </body></html>
