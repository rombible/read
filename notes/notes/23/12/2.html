It has not been brought about by any human hands, but is to be traced directly to him. The value of a gift is always enhanced by the dignity and excellency of the giver, and it confers an inestimable value on the blessings of salvation, that they are conferred by a being no less than the infinite God. It is not by human or angelic power; but it is to be traced directly and entirely to Yahweh.<p>I will trust, and not be afraid - Since God is its author; since he is able to defend me, and to perfect that which he has begun, I will confide in him, and not be afraid of the power or machinations of any enemy. In his hands I am safe. God is the foundation of our confidence; and trusting in him, his people shall never be moved.<p>For the Lord Jehovah - This is one of the four places in which our translators have retained the original word Yahweh, though the Hebrew word occurs often in the Scriptures. The other places where the word Jehovah is retained in our version are, <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>; lsa. <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>. The original in this place is &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;  ya&#770;h yehova&#770;h. The word &#1497;&#1492;  ya&#770;h is an abbreviation of the word Yahweh. The abbreviated form is often used for the sake of conciseness, particularly in the Psalms, as in the expression "Hallelujah" (&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;  halelu&#770;-ya&#770;h), that is, praise Yahweh (<a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/106-48.htm">Psalm 106:48</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-1.htm">Psalm 113:1</a>, "et al.") In this place, and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, "the repetition" of the name seems to be used to denote "emphasis;" or perhaps to indicate that Yahweh is the same always - an unchangeable God. In two codices of Kennicott, however, the name &#1497;&#1492;  ya&#770;h is omitted, and it has been conjectured by some that the repetition is an error of transcribers; but the best MSS. retain it. The Septuagint, the Chaldee, and the Syriac, however, omit it.<p>Is my strength and my song - The same expression occurs in the hymn that Moses composed after the passage of the Red Sea, in imitation of which this song is evidently composed; <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> :<p>Jehovah is my strength and my song,<p>And he is become my salvation.<p>The word 'strength' means, that he is the source of strength, and implies that all who are redeemed are willing to acknowledge that all their strength is n God. The word 'song' implies that he is the proper object of praise; it is to celebrate his praise that the 'song' is composed.<p>He also is become my salvation - This is also found in the song of Moses <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. It means that God had become, or was the author of salvation. It is by his hand that the deliverance bas been effected, and to him should be the praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The idea of salvation was peculiarly associated with the feast of tabernacles (see Isa 12:3). Hence the cry "Hosanna," "Save, we beseech thee," that accompanied Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem on that day (the fifteenth of the seventh month) (Mt 21:9; compare with Ps 118:25, 26); the earnest of the perfected "salvation" which He shall bring to His people at His glorious second appearance at Jerusalem (Heb 9:28). "He shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Compare Re 21:3, "The tabernacle of God is with men." Compare Lu 9:33, "three tabernacles: one for thee," &c. (the transfiguration being a pledge of the future kingdom), (Ps 118:15; Zec 14:16). As the Jew was reminded by the feast of tabernacles of his wanderings in tents in the wilderness, so the Jew-Gentile Church to come shall call to mind, with thanksgiving, the various past ways whereby God has at last brought them to the heavenly "city of habitation" (Ps 107:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God is my salvation; </span> my salvation hath not been brought to pass by man, but by the almighty power of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, God is my salvation,.... Or Saviour; that is, Christ, who is God, the great God, and so fit to be a Saviour, and is one, was appointed by the Father, provided in covenant, promised in the word, sent in the fulness of time, and is become the author of salvation, which a creature could not be; and this the church saw her interest in, and which was the ground of her comfort before declared; and to which she prefixed the word "behold", as a note of asseveration, affirming him to be her Saviour; and of admiration, wondering at it; and of exclusion of all others from being concerned therein; and of attention and direction to others, pointing him out as the only one to look unto. <p>I will trust, and not be afraid; "trust" in Christ for salvation, be confident of enjoying it, and look upon myself safe and secure from all wrath and condemnation, and from every enemy; and not be "afraid" of sin, Satan, the world, death, hell, and wrath to come. The Targum joins this and the preceding clause together, <p>"behold, in the word of God my salvation I trust, and shall not be moved:'' <p>for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; the author of her spiritual strength; the "strength" of her life, and of her heart, which maintained the one, and supported the other; the strength of her graces, and of her duties, by which she exercised the one, and performed the other: and the subject matter of her "song" were his person, and the fulness and fitness of it, his righteousness, and salvation by him; this clause, and the following one, are taken out of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, <p>he also is become my salvation; salvation is wrought out by Christ, and believers have it in him, and they know it, and believe it, and so are already saved in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, God <i>is</i> my <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD <i>is</i> my strength and <i>my</i> song; he also is become my salvation.</span><p>(b) Our salvation stands only in God, who gives us an assured confidence, constancy and opportunity to praise him for the same.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Behold, God</span> is <span class="ital">my salvation</span>] Better: <span class="bld">Behold the God of my salvation</span> (<a href="/psalms/88-1.htm" title="O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you:">Psalm 88:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second half of the verse is repeated almost verbally from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a> my <span class="ital">song</span>] the personal suff. is omitted in Hebr., probably through defective writing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord JEHOVAH</span>] Hebr. <span class="bld">Yah Yahveh</span>, a combination only recurring in ch. <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm" title="Trust you in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:">Isaiah 26:4</a>.

This is quoted from the song of Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>), which the prophet has throughout in his thoughts. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A second question also concerns Israel. The nation out of which and for which this king will primarily arise, will before that time be scattered far away from its native land, in accordance with the revelation in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>. How, then, will it be possible for Him to reign in the midst of it? "And it will come to pass in that day, the Lord will stretch out His hand again a second time to redeem the remnant of His people that shall be left, out of Asshur, and out of Egypt, and out of Pathros, and out of Ethiopia, and out of 'Elam, and out of Shinar, and out of Hamath, and out of the islands of the sea. And he raises a banner for the nations, and fetches home the outcasts of Israel; and the dispersed of Judah will He assemble from the four borders of the earth." Asshur and Egypt stand here in front, and side by side, as the two great powers of the time of Isaiah (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>). As appendices to Egypt, we have (1.) Pathros, hierogl. to-re&#772;s, and with the article petore&#772;s, the southland, i.e., Upper Egypt, so that Mizraim in the stricter sense is Lower Egypt (see, on the other hand, <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>); and (2.) Cush, the land which lies still farther south than Upper Egypt on both sides of the Arabian Gulf; and as appendices to Asshur, (1.) 'Elam, i.e., Elymais, in southern Media, to the east of the Tigris; and (2.) Shinar, the plain to the south of the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris. Then follow the Syrian Hamath at the northern foot of the Lebanon; and lastly, "the islands of the sea," i.e., the islands and coast-land of the Mediterranean, together with the whole of the insular continent of Europe. There was no such diaspora of Israel at the time when the prophet uttered this prediction, nor indeed even after the dissolution of the northern kingdom; so that the specification is not historical, but prophetic. The redemption which the prophet here foretells is a second, to be followed by no third; consequently the banishment out of which Israel is redeemed is the ultimate form of that which is threatened in <a href="/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a> (cf., <a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1</a>.). It is the second redemption, the counterpart of the Egyptian. He will then stretch out His hand again (yo&#772;siph, supply lishloach); and as He once delivered Israel out of Egypt, so will He now redeem it - purchase it back (ka&#770;na&#770;h, opp. ma&#770;car) out of all the countries named. The min attached to the names of the countries is to be construed with likno&#772;th. Observe how, in the prophet's view, the conversion of the heathen becomes the means of the redemption of Israel. The course which the history of salvation has taken since the first coming of Christ, and which is will continue to take to the end, as described by Paul in the Epistle to the Romans, is distinctly indicated by the prophet. At the word of Jehovah the heathen will set His people free, and even escort them (<a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); and thus He will gather again ('a&#770;saph, with reference to the one gathering point; kibbe&#772;tz, with reference to the dispersion of those who are to be gathered together) from the utmost ends of the four quarters of the globe, "the outcasts of the kingdom of Israel, and the dispersed of the kingdom of Judah" (nidche&#772; Yisra&#770;e u&#772;nephutzo&#772;th Yehu&#772;da&#770;h: nidche&#772;  equals  niddeche&#772;, with the dagesh dropped before the following guttural),<p>(Note: The same occurs in &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;.
