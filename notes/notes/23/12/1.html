He has been taught that confession must be blended with thanksgiving—that those only can rightly estimate the comfort which God gives who have first felt His wrath. The fact that the prophet appears as a psalmist was a natural result of the training of the schools of the prophets, as described in <a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>, possibly also of his familiarity with the Temple service as a priest or Levite. The group of psalms ascribed to the sons of Korah presents so many parallelisms to the writings of Isaiah, and so obviously belongs to the same period, that we may reasonably think of him as having been associated with that goodly company.

And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed.

If it is supposed to be applied to the time of the Messiah, then it is language which every redeemed sinner may use, that God was angry with him, but that his anger is turned away. As applicable to the redeemed, it is an acknowledgement which they all feel, that they have no claim to his mercy, and that it lays the foundation for unceasing praise that his anger is turned away by the plan of salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Isa 12:1-6.

The following song of praise; just as Israel did, when they were brought through the Red sea, and saved out of the hands of their enemies; to which there are several allusions and references in it; that deliverance being typical of salvation by Christ; the Gospel day, or the times of the Gospel, are here meant: <p>O Lord, I will praise thee; or "confess thee"; to be my Lord, Redeemer, and Saviour, my Husband, Head, and King; or "confess to thee" (q), my sins and transgressions, and unworthiness to receive any favour from thee, and gratefully acknowledge all the favours bestowed upon me: <p>though thou wast angry with me; as it appeared to the church, and according to her apprehensions of things, though not in reality, or strictly or properly speaking; for anger is not to be ascribed to God; but it is a speaking after the manner of men; and the Lord seems to be angry when he hides his face from his people, when he refuses to hear their cries, when he afflicts them, and continues his hand upon them, and when he lets in a sense of wrath into their consciences: <p>thine anger is turned away; he granting his gracious presence; taking off his afflicting hand; manifesting his love, particularly his pardoning grace and mercy; peace and reconciliation being made by the blood of Christ, and justice satisfied, the effects of resentment and displeasure cease: <p>and thou comfortedst me; by shedding abroad his love in her heart; by discovering the free and full forgiveness of sin; by lifting up the light of his countenance; by an application of precious promises; and by means of the word and ordinances, through the influence of the blessed Spirit as a comforter; who leads in this way for comfort to the person, blood, righteousness, sacrifice, and fulness of Christ, and comforts with these, by applying them, and showing interest in them. The Targum is, <p>"and thou shalt say at that time, I will confess before the Lord; for that I have sinned before thee, thine anger is upon me; but when I am turned to the law, thine anger will turn from me, and thou wilt have mercy on me;'' <p>or rather turned to Christ, and embrace his Gospel, which is the only way to have comfort. <p>(q) "confitebor tibi", V.

On each of her deliverances the Church is hound to praise God. In some parts of the Church it is customary on every such occasion to sing a "Te Deum." The ordinary Israelite hymn of praise appears to have been the hundred and thirty-sixth psalm (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34, 41</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>; 1 Macc. 4:24); but on extraordinary occasions special thanksgivings were sung (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>; 1 Samuel 7:18-29, etc.). Isaiah is now inspired to give a pattern song, suitable for the Church to sing when she is reunited, enlarged, and restored to favor. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. In the day of deliverance and restoration. <span class="cmt_word">Though thou wast angry</span>; literally, <span class="accented">because thou wast angry</span>. Kay understands an actual hank-fullness for the severe discipline, which had checked them, and not allowed them to glide on smoothly to ruin. But perhaps the idiom is rather that of the passage, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes" (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), where it is only the last clause that expresses the true object of the thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Comfortedst</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hast comforted</span>, since the effect continued. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A second question also concerns Israel. The nation out of which and for which this king will primarily arise, will before that time be scattered far away from its native land, in accordance with the revelation in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>. How, then, will it be possible for Him to reign in the midst of it? "And it will come to pass in that day, the Lord will stretch out His hand again a second time to redeem the remnant of His people that shall be left, out of Asshur, and out of Egypt, and out of Pathros, and out of Ethiopia, and out of 'Elam, and out of Shinar, and out of Hamath, and out of the islands of the sea. And he raises a banner for the nations, and fetches home the outcasts of Israel; and the dispersed of Judah will He assemble from the four borders of the earth." Asshur and Egypt stand here in front, and side by side, as the two great powers of the time of Isaiah (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>). As appendices to Egypt, we have (1.) Pathros, hierogl. to-re&#772;s, and with the article petore&#772;s, the southland, i.e., Upper Egypt, so that Mizraim in the stricter sense is Lower Egypt (see, on the other hand, <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>); and (2.) Cush, the land which lies still farther south than Upper Egypt on both sides of the Arabian Gulf; and as appendices to Asshur, (1.) 'Elam, i.e., Elymais, in southern Media, to the east of the Tigris; and (2.) Shinar, the plain to the south of the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris. Then follow the Syrian Hamath at the northern foot of the Lebanon; and lastly, "the islands of the sea," i.e., the islands and coast-land of the Mediterranean, together with the whole of the insular continent of Europe. There was no such diaspora of Israel at the time when the prophet uttered this prediction, nor indeed even after the dissolution of the northern kingdom; so that the specification is not historical, but prophetic. The redemption which the prophet here foretells is a second, to be followed by no third; consequently the banishment out of which Israel is redeemed is the ultimate form of that which is threatened in <a href="/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a> (cf., <a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1</a>.). It is the second redemption, the counterpart of the Egyptian. He will then stretch out His hand again (yo&#772;siph, supply lishloach); and as He once delivered Israel out of Egypt, so will He now redeem it - purchase it back (ka&#770;na&#770;h, opp. ma&#770;car) out of all the countries named. The min attached to the names of the countries is to be construed with likno&#772;th. Observe how, in the prophet's view, the conversion of the heathen becomes the means of the redemption of Israel. The course which the history of salvation has taken since the first coming of Christ, and which is will continue to take to the end, as described by Paul in the Epistle to the Romans, is distinctly indicated by the prophet. At the word of Jehovah the heathen will set His people free, and even escort them (<a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); and thus He will gather again ('a&#770;saph, with reference to the one gathering point; kibbe&#772;tz, with reference to the dispersion of those who are to be gathered together) from the utmost ends of the four quarters of the globe, "the outcasts of the kingdom of Israel, and the dispersed of the kingdom of Judah" (nidche&#772; Yisra&#770;e u&#772;nephutzo&#772;th Yehu&#772;da&#770;h: nidche&#772;  equals  niddeche&#772;, with the dagesh dropped before the following guttural),<p>(Note: The same occurs in &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;.
