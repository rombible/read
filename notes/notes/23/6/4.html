The incense-clouds of the Temple may in either case have been the starting-point of the mystic vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the posts of the door moved </span>— Together with the door itself.

The prophet, standing outside the temple, sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the ark of the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divine glory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision is explained, Joh 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus, God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into the holiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filled with his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple, the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in every contrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government is served. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, which means burners; they burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory against sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares that they are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they do not understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, or promises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be done away by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of the Divine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his own vileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and this holy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that would dare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majesty of God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in Jesus Christ. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, of pardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God in prayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger of being undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, that they go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that he will bear them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the posts of the door - Margin, 'Thresholds.'

Here there had been no smoke at first, and we must suppose it, therefore, a sign of the anger which finds vent in ver. 9-12. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet then proceeds to describe their weapons and war-chariots. "He whose arrows are sharpened, and all his bows strung; the hoofs of his horses are counted like flint, and his wheels like the whirlwind." In the prophet's view they are coming nearer and nearer. For he sees that they have brought the sharpened arrows in their quivers (<a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>); and the fact that all their bows are already trodden (namely, as their length was equal to a man's height, by treading upon the string with the left foot, as we may learn from Arrian's Indica), proves that they are near to the goal. The correct reading in Jablonsky (according to Kimchi's Lex. cf., Michlal yofi) is &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; with dagesh dirimens, as in <a href="/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a> (Ges. 20, 2, b). As the custom of shoeing horses was not practised in ancient times, firm hoofs (&#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, according to Xenophon's Hippikos) were one of the most important points in a good horse. And the horses of the enemy that was now drawing near to Judah had hoofs that would be found like flint (tzar, only used here, equivalent to the Arabic zirr). Homer designates such horses Chalkopodes, brazen-footed. And the two wheels of the war-chariots, to which they were harnessed, turned with such velocity, and overthrew everything before them with such violence, that it seemed not merely as if a whirlwind drove them forward, but as if they were the whirlwind itself (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>). Nahum compares them to lightning (<a href="/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a>). Thus far the prophet's description has moved on, as if by forced marches, in clauses of from two to four words each. It now changes into a heavy, stealthy pace, and then in a few clauses springs like a wild beast upon its prey. </body></html>
