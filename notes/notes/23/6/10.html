It implies the reckless headstrong will which defies restraint and warnings. So the poets of Greece, in their thoughts as to the Divine government of the world, recognised the truth that there is a judicial blindness and, as it were, insanity of will that comes as the consequence of sinful deeds ( Æsch. <span class= "ital">Agam. </span>370-386).

Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make the heart - The word "heart" here is used in the sense of the "mind" - to denote all their mental powers.

'Go, and proclaim truth to a corrupt and sensual people, and the result will be that they will not hear; they are so wicked that they will not attend to it; they will become even more hardened; yet go, and though certain of producing this effect, still proclaim it;' see this passage explained in the notes at <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>.<p>Their ears heavy - Dull, stupid, insensible.<p>And shut their eyes - The word used here means "to spread over," and then to close.

Make &#8230; fat&#8212;(Ps 119:17). "Render them the more hardened by thy warnings" [Maurer]. This effect is the fruit, not of the truth in itself, but of the corrupt state of their hearts, to which God here judicially gives them over (Isa 63:17). Gesenius takes the imperatives as futures. "Proclaim truths, the result of which proclamation will be their becoming the more hardened" (Ro 1:28; Eph 4:18); but this does not so well as the former set forth God as designedly giving up sinners to judicial hardening (Ro 11:8; 2Th 2:11). In the first member of the sentence, the order is, the heart, ears, eyes; in the latter, the reverse order, the eyes, ears, heart. It is from the heart that corruption flows into the ears and eyes (Mr 7:21, 22); but through the eyes and ears healing reaches the heart (Ro 10:17), [Bengel]. (Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Zec 7:11; Ac 7:57; 2Ti 4:4). In Mt 13:15, the words are quoted in the indicative, "is waxed gross" (so the Septuagint), not the imperative, "make fat"; God's word as to the future is as certain as if it were already fulfilled. To see with one's eyes will not convince a will that is opposed to the truth (compare Joh 11:45, 46; 12:10, 11).

To the Hebrew mind what we call secondary causes scarcely exist, at least in the sphere of religion. That which, in given circumstances, is the inevitable result of God’s providential dispensations is viewed absolutely, apart from its conditions, as a distinct divine purpose. The truth revealed to Isaiah is that the unbelief of his countrymen amounts to an incapacity for divine things, which can only be intensified by the further disclosure of the truth of God. And this, which is the inevitable issue of his own prophetic mission, is represented to him as Jehovah’s intention in sending him. Isaiah realises the profound truth that the most decisive and searching judgment to which men are subjected lies in the abundance of the revelations of God vouchsafed to them. It is a principle often appealed to in the New Testament, and frequently in the very words of our prophet (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a> f. and parallels; <a href="/acts/16-26.htm" title="And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.">Acts 16:26</a> f.; <a href="/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>). “This is the judgment that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil” (<a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make the heart of this people fat.</span> Isaiah is commanded to effect by his preaching that which his preaching would, in fact, effect.

The words have a national, not an individual, application. <span class="cmt_word">Shut their eyes</span>; literally, <span class="accented">besmear their eyes</span>; or, <span class="accented">seal them up</span>. Such sealing has been employed by Oriental monarchs as a punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And convert</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "turn to God." Our translators have used the word in an intransitive sense. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Isaiah heard this, he stood entranced at the farthest possible distance from Him that sat upon the throne, namely, under the door of the heavenly palace or temple. What he still further felt and saw, he proceeds to relate in <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a> : "And the foundations of the thresholds shook with the voice of them that cried; and the house became full of smoke." By &#8219;ammoth hassippim, the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and others understand the posts of the lintels, the supporting beams of the superliminaria, which closed the doorway at the top. But as saph is only used in other places to signify the threshold and porch (limen and vestibulum), &#8219;ammoth hassippim must be understood here in the (perfectly appropriate) sense of "the foundations of the thresholds" (amma&#770;h, which bears the same relation to &#1506;&#1501;, mother, as matrix to mater, is used to denote the receptive basis into which the door-steps with their plugs were inserted, like the talmudic ammeta&#770;h dere&#772;chayya&#770;h, the frame or box of the hand-mill (Berachoth 18b), and ammath mege&#772;rah, the wood-work which runs along the back of the saw and keeps it firmly extended (Kelim 21, 3); compare the "Schraubenmutter," literally screw-mother, or female screw, which receives and holds the cylindrical screw). Every time that the choir of seraphim (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;: compare such collective singulars as ha&#770;'oreb, the ambush, in <a href="/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>; hecha&#770;lutz, of men of war, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-7.htm">Joshua 6:7</a>, etc.) began their song, the support of the threshold of the porch in which Isaiah was standing trembled. The building was seized with reverential awe throughout its whole extent, and in its deepest foundations: for in the blessed state beyond, nothing stands immoveable or unsusceptible in relation to the spirits there; but all things form, as it were, the accidentia of their free personality, yielding to their impressions, and voluntarily following them in all their emotions. The house was also "filled with smoke." Many compare this with the similar occurrence in connection with the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10</a>); but Drechsler is correct in stating that the two cases are not parallel, for there God simply attested His own presence by the cloud of smoke behind which He concealed Himself, whereas here there was no need of any such self-attestation. Moreover, in this instance God does not dwell in the cloud and thick darkness, whilst the smoke is represented as the effect of the songs of praise in which the seraphim have joined, and not of the presence of God. The smoke arose from the altar of incense mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a>. But when Drechsler says that it was the prayers of saints (as in <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>), which ascended to the Lord in the smoke, this is a thought which is quite out of place here. The smoke was the immediate consequence of the seraphs' song of praise.<p>This begins to throw a light upon the name seraphim, which may help us to decipher it. The name cannot possibly be connected with sa&#770;ra&#770;ph, a snake (Sanscr. sarpa, Lat. serpens); and to trace the word to a verb sa&#770;raph in the sense of the Arabic 'sarafa ('sarufa), to tower high, to be exalted, or highly honoured (as Gesenius, Hengstenberg, Hofmann, and others have done), yields a sense which does not very strongly commend itself. On the other hand, to follow Knobel, who reads sha&#770;ra&#770;thim (worshippers of God), and thus presents the Lexicon with a new word, and to pronounce the word serpahim a copyist's error, would be a rash concession to the heaven-storming omnipotence which is supposed to reside in the ink of a German scholar. It is hardly admissible, however, to interpret the name as signifying directly spirits of light or fire, since the true meaning of sa&#770;raph is not urere (to burn), but Comburere (to set on fire or burn up). Umbreit endeavours to do justice to this transitive meaning by adopting the explanation "fiery beings," by which all earthly corruption is opposed and destroyed. The vision itself, however, appears to point to a much more distinctive and special meaning in the name, which only occurs in this passage of Isaiah. We shall have more to say upon this point presently. </body></html>
