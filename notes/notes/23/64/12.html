Sin is that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Our deeds, whatever they may seem to be, if we think to merit by them at God's hand, are as rags, and will not cover us; filthy rags, and will but defile us. Even our few good works in which there is real excellence, as fruits of the Spirit, are so defective and defiled as done by us, that they need to be washed in the fountain open for sin and uncleanness. It bodes ill when prayer is kept back. To pray, is by faith to take hold of the promises the Lord has made of his good-will to us, and to plead them; to take hold of him, earnestly begging him not to leave us; or soliciting his return. They brought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly. Sinners are blasted, and then carried away, by the wind of their own iniquity; it withers and then ruins them. When they made themselves as an unclean thing, no wonder that God loathed them. Foolish and careless as we are, poor and despised, yet still Thou art our Father. It is the wrath of a Father we are under, who will be reconciled; and the relief our case requires is expected only from him. They refer themselves to God. They do not say, Lord, rebuke us not, for that may be necessary; but, Not in thy displeasure. They state their lamentable condition. See what ruin sin brings upon a people; and an outward profession of holiness will be no defence against it. God's people presume not to tell him what he shall say, but their prayer is, Speak for the comfort and relief of thy people. How few call upon the Lord with their whole hearts, or stir themselves to lay hold upon him! God may delay for a time to answer our prayers, but he will, in the end, answer those who call on his name and hope in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wilt thou refrain thyself - Wilt thou refuse to come to our aid? Wilt thou decline to visit us, and save us from our calamities?<p>Wilt thou hold thy peace - Wilt thou not speak for our rescue, and command us to be delivered? Thus closes this chapter of great tenderness and beauty. It is a model of affectionate and earnest entreaty for the divine interposition in the day of calamity. With such tender and affectionate earnestness may we learn to plead with God! Thus may all his people learn to approach him as a Father: thus feel that they have the inestimable privilege, in times of trial, of making known their needs to the High and Holy One. Thus, when calamity presses on us; when as individuals or as families we are afflicted; or when our country or the church is suffering under long trials, may we go to God and humbly confess our sins, and urge his promises, and take hold of his strength, and plead with him to interpose. Thus pleading, be will hear us; thus presenting our cause, he will interpose to save. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. for these things&#8212;Wilt Thou, notwithstanding these calamities of Thy people, still refuse Thy aid (Isa 42:14)?   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/64.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, </span> viz. that are done by the Babylonians? do none of these things move thee to take vengeance on them? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wilt thou hold thy peace; </span> wilt thou be as one that regards not?

"And there was no one who called upon Thy name, who aroused himself to lay firm hold of Thee: for Thou hadst hidden Thy face from us, and didst melt us into the hand of our transgressions." There was no one (see <a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>) who had risen up in prayer and intercession out of this deep fall, or had shaken himself out of the sleep of security and lethargy of insensibility, to lay firm hold of Jehovah, i.e., not to let Him go till He blessed him and his people again. The curse of God pressed every one down; God had withdrawn His grace from them, and given them up to the consequences of their sins. The form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not softened from the pilel &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but is a kal like &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ekil  in <a href="/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a> (which see), &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; being used in a transitive sense, as ku&#772;n is there (cf., shu&#772;bh, <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; mu&#772;sh, <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>).
