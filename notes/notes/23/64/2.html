This is applicable to the second coming of Christ, when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. They plead what God had used to do, and had declared his gracious purpose to do, for his people. They need not fear being disappointed of it, for it is sure; or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient. The happiness of his people is bound up in what God has designed for them, and is preparing for them, and preparing them for; what he has done or will do. Can we believe this, and then think any thing too great to expect from his truth, power, and love? It is spiritual and cannot be comprehended by human understanding. It is ever ready. See what communion there is between a gracious God and a gracious soul. We must make conscience of doing our duty in every thing the Lord our God requires. Thou meetest him; this speaks his freeness and forwardness in doing them good. Though God has been angry with us for our sins, and justly, yet his anger has soon ended; but in his favour is life, which goes on and continues, and on that we depend for our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As when the melting fire burneth - Margin, 'The fire of meltings.' Lowth renders it, 'As when the fire kindleth the dry fuel.' So Noyes, 'As fire kindleth the dry stubble.' The Septuagint render it: &#x3a9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Ho&#772;s ke&#772;ros apo proso&#772;pou puros te&#772;ketai - 'As wax is melted before the fire.' So the Syriac renders it. The Hebrew word rendered here in the margin 'meltings' (&#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;  ha&#774;ma&#770;s&#305;&#770;ym), properly means, according to Gesenius, brushwood, twigs. So Saddias renders it. And the true idea here is, that the presence of Yahweh would cause the mountains to melt, as a fire consumes light and dry brushwood or stubble. Dr. Jubb supposes that the meaning is, 'As the fire of things smelted burneth' - an idea which would furnish a striking comparison, but there is much doubt whether the Hebrew will bear that construction.<p>The comparison is a very vivid and sublime one, as it is in the view given above - that the presence of Yahweh would set on fire the mountains, and cause them to flow down as under the operation of an intense heat. I do not know that there is reason to suppose that the prophet had any reference to a volcanic eruption, or that he was acquainted with such a phenomenon - though Syria and Palestine abounded in volcanic appearances, and the country around the Dead Sea is evidently volcanic (see Lyell's Geology, i. 299); but the following description may furnish an illustration of what would be exhibited by the flowing down of the mountains at the presence of Yahweh, and may serve to show the force of the language which the prophet employs in these verses. It is a description of an eruption of Vesuvius in 1779, by Sir William Hamilton. 'Jets of liquid lava,' says he, 'mixed with stones and scoriae, were thrown up to the height of at least 10,000 feet, having the appearance of a column of fire.<p>The falling matter being nearly as vividly inflamed as that which was continually issuing forth from the crater, formed with it one complete body of fire, which could not be less than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary height above mentioned, casting a heat to the distance of at least six miles around it.' Speaking of the lava which flowed from the mountain, he says, 'At the point where it issued from an arched chasm in the side of the mountain, the vivid torrent rushed with the velocity of a flood. It was in perfect fusion, unattended with any scoriae on its surface, or any gross material not in a state of complete solution. It flowed with the translucency of honey, in regular channels, cut finer than art can imitate, and glowing with all the splendor of the sun' (Lyell's Geology, i. 316). Perhaps there can be conceived no more sublime representation of what was in the mind of the prophet than such an overflowing volcano. It should be observed, however, that Gesenius supposes that the word which is rendered <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-3</a>, 'flow down' (&#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  na&#772;zolu&#770;), is derived, not from &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;  na&#772;zal, to flow, to run as liquids do; but from &#1494;&#1500;&#1500;  za&#770;lal, to shake, to tremble, to quake as mountains do in an earthquake. But it seems to me that the connection rather demands the former signification, as the principal elements in the figure is fire - and the office of fire is not to cause to tremble, but to burn or melt. The effect here described as illustrative of the presence of God, was that produced by intense burning heat.<p>The fire causeth the waters to boil - Such an effect was anticipated at the presence of Yahweh. The idea is still that of an intense heat, that should cause all obstacles to be consumed before the presence of the Lord. To illustrate this, the prophet speaks of that which is known to be most intense, that which causes water to boil; and the prayer is, that Yahweh would descend in the manner of such intense and glowing fire, in order that a the foes of the people might be destroyed, and all the obstacles to the restoration of his people removed. The exact point of the comparison, as I conceive, is the intensity of the heat, as emblematic of the majesty of Yahweh, and of the certain destruction of his foes.<p>To make thy name known - By the exhibition of thy majesty and glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Or, "the fire of melting" (k); a strong vehement fire, as Kimchi, such as is used under a furnace for melting metals; though De Dieu thinks a slow gentle fire is intended, such as is sufficient to keep the liquor boiling; which he concludes from the use of the word in the Arabic language, which, according to an Arabic lexicographer (l) he quotes, so signifies; and to the same purpose Hottinger (m), by the help of the Arabic language, interprets the word of a small low noise, the hissing of a boiling pot; though, as Vitringa observes, could it be granted, which can not, that a slow fire raises great bubbles in water, such as when it boils; yet the fire, with which God consumes his enemies, in a figurative sense, is represented as most vehement and noisy. It seems much better, with R. Jonah, quoted by Kimchi, to understand it of "dry stubble", which makes a great blaze and noise, and causes water to boil and rise up in bubbles; and with this agree some other versions, which render it by "bavins" (n), dry sticks and branches of trees; which being kindled, <p>the fire causeth the waters to boil; as the fire, under the pot, causes the waters to boil in it; the church here prays that the wrath of God might break forth upon his and her enemies, like fire that melts metals, and boils water. The figures used seem to denote the fierceness and vehemency of it. The Targum is, <p>"as when thou sendedst thine anger as fire in the days of Elijah, the sea was melted, the fire licked up the water;'' <p>as if the allusion was to the affair in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>, but rather the allusion is, as Kimchi and others think, to the fire that burnt on Mount Sinai, when the Lord descended on it, and the cloud which flowed with water, as the above writer supposes, and which both together caused the smoke: <p>to make thy name known to thine adversaries; his terrible name, in the destruction of them; his power and his glory: <p>that the nations may tremble at thy presence; as Sinai trembled when the Lord was on it; and as the antichristian states will when Christ appears, and the vials of his wrath will be poured out; and the Lord's people will be delivered, and the Jews particularly converted. <p>(k)  "ignis liquefactionum", Calvin, Vatablus; "igne liquationum", Cocceius.

"Look from heaven and see, from the habitation of Thy holiness and majesty! Where is Thy zeal and Thy display of might? The pressure of Thy bowels and Thy compassions are restrained towards me." On the relation between &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;, to look up, to open the eyes, and &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, to fix the eye upon a thing. It is very rarely that we meet with the words in the reverse order, &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1496; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (vid., <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>). In the second clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, instead of missha&#770;mayim (from heaven), we have "from the dwelling-place (mizzebhul) of Thy holiness and majesty." The all-holy and all-glorious One, who once revealed Himself so gloriously in the history of Israel, has now withdrawn into His own heaven, where He is only revealed to the spirits. The object of the looking and seeing, as apparent from what follows, is the present helpless condition of the people in their sufferings, to which there does not seem likely to be any end. There are no traces now of the kin'a&#770;h (zeal) with which Jehovah used to strive on behalf of His people, and against their oppressors (<a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), or of the former displays of His gebhu&#772;ra&#770;h (&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;, as it is correctly written in Ven. 1521, is a defective plural). In <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a> we have not a continued question ("the sounding of Thy bowels and Thy mercies, which are restrained towards me?"), as Hitzig and Knobel suppose. The words 'e&#772;lai hith'appa&#770;qu&#772; have not the appearance of an attributive clause, either according to the new strong thought expressed, or according to the order of the words (with &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; written first). On strepitus viscerum, as the effect and sign of deep sympathy, see at <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>. &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, or rather &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, of the form &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) both signify primarily &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, strictly speaking the soft inward parts of the body; the latter from the root &#1502;&#1506;, to be pulpy or soft, the former from the root &#1495;&#1512;, to be slack, loose, or soft. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, as the plural of the predicate shows, does not govern &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; also. It is presupposed that the love of Jehovah urges Him towards His people, to relieve their misery; but His compassion and sympathy apparently put constraint upon themselves (hith'appe&#772;q as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>, lit., se superare, from 'a&#770;phaq, root &#1508;&#1511;), to abstain from working on behalf of Israel. </body></html>
