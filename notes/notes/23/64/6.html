We are all, by sin, not only become obnoxious to God’s justice, but odious to his holiness. “The prophets frequently borrow their images from the received customs and spiritual ceremonies of the nations among which the distinction between things <span class="ital">clean </span>and <span class="ital">unclean </span>makes no small figure; and under these images they frequently describe moral defects and religious offences, as in the present passage.” <span class="ital">And all our righteousnesses, </span>or, <span class="ital">justifications, are as filthy rags </span>— As <span class="ital">rags, </span>which cannot cover us; as <span class="ital">filthy rags, </span>which would only defile us.

Sin is that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Our deeds, whatever they may seem to be, if we think to merit by them at God's hand, are as rags, and will not cover us; filthy rags, and will but defile us. Even our few good works in which there is real excellence, as fruits of the Spirit, are so defective and defiled as done by us, that they need to be washed in the fountain open for sin and uncleanness. It bodes ill when prayer is kept back. To pray, is by faith to take hold of the promises the Lord has made of his good-will to us, and to plead them; to take hold of him, earnestly begging him not to leave us; or soliciting his return. They brought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly. Sinners are blasted, and then carried away, by the wind of their own iniquity; it withers and then ruins them. When they made themselves as an unclean thing, no wonder that God loathed them. Foolish and careless as we are, poor and despised, yet still Thou art our Father. It is the wrath of a Father we are under, who will be reconciled; and the relief our case requires is expected only from him. They refer themselves to God. They do not say, Lord, rebuke us not, for that may be necessary; but, Not in thy displeasure. They state their lamentable condition. See what ruin sin brings upon a people; and an outward profession of holiness will be no defence against it. God's people presume not to tell him what he shall say, but their prayer is, Speak for the comfort and relief of thy people. How few call upon the Lord with their whole hearts, or stir themselves to lay hold upon him! God may delay for a time to answer our prayers, but he will, in the end, answer those who call on his name and hope in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But we are all as an unclean thing - We are all polluted and defiled. The word used here (&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;  t&#803;a&#770;me&#772;'), means properly that which is polluted and defiled in a Levitical sense; that is, which was regarded as polluted and abominable by the law of Moses <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-19.htm">Deuteronomy 14:19</a>, and may refer to animals, people, or things; also in a moral sense <a href="/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>. The sense is, that they regarded themselves as wholly polluted and depraved.<p>And all our righteousnesses - The plural form is used to denote the deeds which they had performed - meaning that pollution extended to every individual thing of the numerous acts which they had done. The sense is, that all their prayers, sacrifices, alms, praises, were mingled with pollution, and were worthy only of deep detestation and abhorrence.<p>As filthy rags - 'Like a garment of stated times' (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;iddiym) - from the obsolete root &#1506;&#1491;&#1491;  &#8219;a&#770;dad, "to number, to reckon, to determine," e. g., time. No language could convey deeper abhorrenee of their deeds of righteousness than this reference - as it is undoubtedly - to the vestis menstruis polluta.

What a beautiful description this is of the state of man! Strength, vigor, comeliness, and beauty thus fade away, and, like the 'sere and yellow leaf' of autumn, fall to the earth.

Or "we have been" (t); so all men are in a state of nature: man was made pure and holy, but by sinning became impure; and this impurity is propagated by natural generation, and belongs to all, none are free from it; and there is no cleansing from it but by the grace of God and blood of Christ: all are not sensible of it; some are, as the church here was, and owns it, and the universality of it, and compares herself and members to an "unclean thing", on account of it; so men, defiled with sin, are compared to unclean creatures, dogs, and swine, and to unclean persons; to such as are covered with loathsome diseases, and particularly to leprous persons, and who may be chiefly intended here; they being defiled and defiling, loathsome and abominable, their disease spreading and continuing, and incurable by physicians; hence they were separated from the company of men; and the words may be rendered, "as an unclean person" (u), as such were by the law: or we are, in our own sense and apprehension of things; and this may respect not only the impurity of nature, but a general corruption in doctrine and manners among the professors of religion; such as was in the Jewish church about the time of Christ's coming. <p>And all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; which is to be understood not of the righteousness of some persons in the church, which lay in outward rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices, which were no righteousness before God, and could not take away sin; and were indeed on many accounts, as they were performed, loathsome and abominable; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, or of others that lay in outward legal duties and works of the law, which were not done from right principles, as well as not perfect; and so, because of the impurity, imperfection, pride, and vanity, that appeared in them, were abominable to the Lord: but of the righteousnesses of the church herself; not of the righteousness of Christ, which was made hers by imputation; for this is not rags, but a robe, the best robe, and wedding garment; much less filthy, but pure and spotless, beautiful and glorious, as well as a proper covering; but then, though this is the church's, and all true believers', by gift, by imputation and application, yet its is properly Christ's and is in him, and is opposed to their own righteousness; which is what is intended here, even the best of it; such works of righteousness as are done by them in the best manner; they are "rags", not whole, but imperfect, not fit to appear in before God, and by which they cannot be justified in his sight; they are "filthy" ones, being attended with imperfection and sin; and these conversation garments need continual washing in the blood of Jesus; this is the language not of a natural man, or of a Pharisee, but of a sensible sinner, a truly gracious soul. The words may be rendered, "as a menstruous cloth" (w), as some; or "as a garment of spoil or prey" (x), as Aben Ezra, rolled in blood, either in war, or by a beast of prey; or as a foul plaster or cloth taken off a sore, with purulent matter on it (y), as others; or any other impure and nauseous thing. Hottinger (z) thinks the word has some affinity with the Arabic  which signifies "running water", such as the water of a fountain or well; so that the sense may be, that the church's righteousness was like a cloth, so polluted and spotted that it could not be washed out clean but with clear and running water; and, in every sense in which it may be taken, it serves to set forth the impurity and imperfection of the best righteousness of men, and to show that their works are not the cause of salvation, the church had an assurance of in the preceding verse: <p>and we all do fade as a leaf; or "fall" (a) as one; as leaves in autumn: this is to be understood of a great part, and perhaps of the greater part, of the visible members of the church; not of true believers and real members, for these are rooted in the love of God, and in Christ, and have the root of the matter in them, the true grace of God; and therefore, though they meet with many blustering storms, yet do not cast their leaf of profession; indeed there may be, as there often are, decays and declensions in them; but rather this is to be interpreted of carnal professors, with which, at this time, the church abounded, who had no true grace in them; and so dropped their profession, and became like trees whose fruit withered, were without fruit; or like trees, in the fall of the year, which are without fruit, and shed their leaves, Jde 1:12, <p>and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away; as a leaf falling from the tree is carried away with the wind, which it is not able to withstand; so formal and carnal professors are carried away, through their sins, with the wind of persecution, and apostatize: or rather for their sins the Jews were carried captive, as before, to Babylon; so now by the Romans into various countries, where they are dispersed at this day; to which this passage may have some respect.

As Hooker says, "Our very repentances require to be repented of." <span class="cmt_word">We all do fade as a leaf</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>, "Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth;" see also <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>). Our iniquities...  have taken as away; or, <span class="accented">carried us away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> taken us far from God, carried us into a region where God is not, or where at any rate "his presence is not felt" (Cheyne). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/63.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the existing condition of Israel looks like a withdrawal of this grace; and it is impossible that these contrasts should cease, unless Jehovah comes down from heaven as the deliverer of His people. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>). "For a little time Thy holy people was in possession. Our adversaries have trodden down Thy sanctuary. We have become such as He who is from everlasting has not ruled over, upon whom Thy name was not called. O that Thou wouldst rend the heaven, come down, the mountains would shake before thy countenance." It is very natural to try whether ya&#770;reshu&#772; may not have tsa&#770;re&#772;nu&#772; for its subject (cf., <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>); but all the attempts made to explain the words on this supposition, show that lammits&#8219;a&#770;r is at variance with the idea that ya&#770;reshu&#772; refers to the foes. Compare, for example, Jerome's rendering "quasi nihilum (i.e., ad nihil et absque allo labore) possederunt populum sanctum tuum;" that of Cocceius, "propemodum ad haereditatem;" and that of Stier, "for a little they possess entirely Thy holy nation." Mits&#8219;a&#770;r is the harsher form for miz&#8219;a&#770;r, which the prophet uses in <a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a> for a contemptibly small space of time; and as &#1500; is commonly used to denote the time to which, towards which, within which, and through which, anything occurs (cf., <a href="/2_chronicles/11-17.htm">2 Chronicles 11:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-17.htm">2 Chronicles 29:17</a>; Ewald, 217, d), lammits&#8219;a&#770;r may signify for a (lit. the well-known) short time (per breve tempus; like &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;  &#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, a year long). If miqda&#770;sh could mean the holy land, as Hitzig and others suppose, miqda&#770;shekha&#770; might be the common object of both sentences (Ewald, 351, p. 838). But miqdash Jehovah (the sanctuary of Jehovah) is the place of His abode and worship; and "taking possession of the temple" is hardly an admissible expression. On the other hand, ya&#770;rash ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, to take possession of the (holy) land, is so common a phrase (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>), that with the words "Thy holy people possessed for a little (time)" we naturally supply the holy land as the object. The order of the words in the two clauses is chiastic. The two strikingly different subjects touch one another as the two inner members. Of the perfects, the first expresses the more remote past, the second the nearer past, as in <a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>. The two clauses of the v. rhyme - the holiest thing in the possession of the people, which was holy according to the choice and calling of Jehovah, being brought into the greatest prominence; bo&#772;se&#772;s  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. Hahn's objection, that the time between the conquest of the land and the Chaldean catastrophe could not be called mits&#8219;a&#770;r (a little while), may be answered, from the fact that a time which is long in itself shrinks up when looked back upon or recalled, and that as an actual fact from the time of David and Solomon, when Israel really rejoiced in the possession of the land, the coming catastrophe began to be foreboded by many significant preludes. <p>The lamentation in <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> proceeds from the same feeling which caused the better portion of the past to vanish before the long continuance of the mournful present. Hitzig renders &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; "we were;" Hahn, "we shall be;" but here, where the speaker is not looking back, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a>, at a state of things which has come to an end, but rather at one which is still going on, it signifies "we have become." The passage is rendered correctly in S.: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; (or better, &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;  &#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. The virtual predicate to ha&#770;y&#305;&#772;nu&#772; commences with me&#772;&#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m: "we have become such (or like such persons) as," etc.; which would be fully expressed by &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501;, or merely &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, or without &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and simply by transposing the words, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; (cf., <a href="/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>): compare the virtual subject &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14</a>, and the virtual object &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a> (Ewald, 333, b). Every form of "as if" is intentionally omitted. The relation in which Jehovah placed Himself to Israel, viz., as its King, and as to His own people called by His name, appears not only as though it had been dissolved, but as though it had never existed at all. The existing state of Israel is a complete practical denial of any such relation. Deeper tones than these no lamentation could possibly utter, and hence the immediate utterance of the sigh which goes up to heaven: "O that Thou wouldst rend heaven!" It is extremely awkward to begin a fresh chapter with &#1499;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1495; ("as when the melting fire burneth"); at the same time, the Masoretic division of the vv. is unassailable.<p>(Note: In the Hebrew Bibles, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-12</a> commences at the second v. of our version; and the first v. is attached to <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> of the previous chapter. - Tr.)<p>For <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>) could not be attached to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-2</a>, since this v. would be immensely overladen; moreover, this sigh really belongs to <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> (<a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>), and ascends out of the depth of the lamentation uttered there. On utinam discideris  equals  discinderes, see at <a href="/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a>. The wish presupposes that the gracious presence of God had been withdrawn from Israel, and that Israel felt itself to be separated from the world beyond by a thick party-wall, resembling an impenetrable black cloud. The closing member of the optative clause is generally rendered (utinam) a facie tua montes diffluerent (e.g., Rosenmller after the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), or more correctly, defluerent (Jerome), as na&#770;zal means to flow down, not to melt. The meaning therefore would be, "O that they might flow down, as it were to the ground melting in the fire" (Hitzig). The form na&#770;zollu cannot be directly derived from na&#770;zal, if taken in this sense; for it is a pure fancy that na&#770;zo&#772;llu&#772; may be a modification of the pausal &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; with o&#772; for a&#772;, and the so-called dagesh affectuosum). Stier invents a verb med. o. &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;. The more probable supposition is, that it is a niphal formed from za&#770;la&#772;l  equals  na&#770;zal (Ewald, 193, c). But za&#770;lal signifies to hang down slack, to sway to and fro (hence zo&#772;le&#772;l, lightly esteemed, and zalzall&#305;&#772;m, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>, pliable branches), like zu&#772;l in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>, to shake, to pour down;<p>(Note: Just as the Greek has in addition to &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;-&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; the much simpler and more root-like &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;-&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; so the Semitic has, besides &#1494;&#1500;, the roots &#1494;&#1488;, &#1494;&#1506;: compare the Arabic &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500;, &#1494;&#1488;&#1494;&#1506;, &#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;, all three denoting restless motion.)<p>and na&#770;zo&#772;llu, if derived from this, yields the appropriate sense concuterentur (compare the Arabic zalzala, which is commonly applied to an earthquake). The nearest niphal form would be &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (or resolved, &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>); but instead of the a of the second syllable, the niphal of the verbs &#1506; has sometimes o, like the verb &#1506; &#1493; (e.g., &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; Ges. 67, Anm. 5). </body></html>
