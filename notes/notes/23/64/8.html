Here, however (as in <a href="/jeremiah/18-6.htm" title="O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? said the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.">Jeremiah 18:6</a>), another aspect is presented to us, and the power of the Great Potter is made the ground of prayer. The “clay” entreats Him to fashion it according to His will, and has faith in His readiness, as well as His power, to comply with that prayer.

Sin is that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Our deeds, whatever they may seem to be, if we think to merit by them at God's hand, are as rags, and will not cover us; filthy rags, and will but defile us. Even our few good works in which there is real excellence, as fruits of the Spirit, are so defective and defiled as done by us, that they need to be washed in the fountain open for sin and uncleanness. It bodes ill when prayer is kept back. To pray, is by faith to take hold of the promises the Lord has made of his good-will to us, and to plead them; to take hold of him, earnestly begging him not to leave us; or soliciting his return. They brought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly. Sinners are blasted, and then carried away, by the wind of their own iniquity; it withers and then ruins them. When they made themselves as an unclean thing, no wonder that God loathed them. Foolish and careless as we are, poor and despised, yet still Thou art our Father. It is the wrath of a Father we are under, who will be reconciled; and the relief our case requires is expected only from him. They refer themselves to God. They do not say, Lord, rebuke us not, for that may be necessary; but, Not in thy displeasure. They state their lamentable condition. See what ruin sin brings upon a people; and an outward profession of holiness will be no defence against it. God's people presume not to tell him what he shall say, but their prayer is, Speak for the comfort and relief of thy people. How few call upon the Lord with their whole hearts, or stir themselves to lay hold upon him! God may delay for a time to answer our prayers, but he will, in the end, answer those who call on his name and hope in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>).<p>We are the clay - The idea seems to be, that their condition then had been produced by him as clay is moulded by the potter, and that they were to be returned and restored entirely by him - as they had no more power to do it than the clay had to shape itself. The sense is, that they were wholly in his hand and at his disposal (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>).<p>And thou our potter - Thou hast power to mould us as the potter does the clay.<p>And we all are the work of thy hand - That is, as the vessel made by the potter is his work. We have been formed by thee, and we are dependent on thee to make us what thou wilt have us to be. This whole verse is an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of God. It expresses the feeling which all have when under conviction of sin; and when they are sensible that they are exposed to the divine displeasure for their transgressions. Then they feel that if they are to be saved, it must be by the mere sovereignty of God; and then they implore his interposition to 'mould and guide them at his will.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. father&#8212;(Isa 63:16).<p>clay &#8230; potter&#8212;(Isa 29:16; 45:9).

Yet <a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a> (2) does not form a new and independent sentence; but we must in thought repeat the word upon which the principal emphasis rests in <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>). "(Wouldst come down) as fire kindles brushwood, fire causes water to boil; to make known Thy name to Thine adversaries, that the heathen may tremble before Thy face! When Thou doest terrible things which we hoped not for; wouldst come down, (and) mountains shake before Thy countenance!" The older expositors gave themselves a great deal of trouble in the attempt to trace ha&#774;ma&#770;s&#305;&#772;m to ma&#770;sas, to melt. But since Louis de Dieu and Albert Schultens have followed Saadia and Abulwlid in citing the Arabic hms, to crack, to mutter, to mumble, etc., and hs&#780;m, to break in pieces, confringere, from which comes hashim, broken, dry wood, it is generally admitted that ha&#774;ma&#770;sim is from hemes (lit. crackling, rattling, Arab. hams), and signifies "dry twigs," arida sarmenta. The second simile might be rendered, "as water bubbles up in the fire;" and in that case mayim would be treated as a feminine (according to the rule in Ges. 146, 3), in support of which <a href="/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a> may be adduced as an unquestionable example (although in other cases it is masculine), and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; would be used in a local sense, like leha&#770;bha&#770;h, into flames, in <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>. But it is much more natural to take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, which is just as often a feminine as &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is a masculine, as the subject of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, and to give to the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, which is originally intransitive, judging from the Arabic bga&#770;, to swell, the Chald. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to spring up (compare &#1488;&#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, blisters, pustules), the Syr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1488;, to bubble up, etc., the transitive meaning to cause to boil or bubble up, rather than the intransitive to boil (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-13.htm">Isaiah 30:13</a>, &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, swollen  equals  bent forwards, as it were protumidus). Jehovah is to come down with the same irresistible force which fire exerts upon brushwood or water, when it sets the former in flames and makes the latter boil; in order that by such a display of might He may make His name known (viz., the name thus judicially revealing itself, hence "in fire," <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>) to His adversaries, and that nations (viz., those that are idolaters) may tremble before Him (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;: cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-3</a>). The infinitive clause denoting the purpose, like that indicating the comparison, passes into the finite (cf., <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>). Modern commentators for the most part now regard the optative lu&#772;' (O that) as extending to <a href="/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a> also; and, in fact, although this continued influence of lu&#772;' appears to overstep the bounds of the possible, we are forced to resort to this extremity. <a href="/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a> cannot contain a historical retrospect: the word "formerly" would be introduced if it did, and the order of the words would be a different one. Again, we cannot assume that &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468; contains an expression of confidence, or that the prefects indicate certainty. Neither the context, the foregoing &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; &#1504;&#1493; (why not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;?), nor the parenthetical assertion &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, permits of this. On the other hand, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; connects itself very appropriately with the purposes indicated in <a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a> (2.): "may tremble when Thou doest terrible things, which we, i.e., such as we, do not look for," i.e., which surpass our expectations. And now nothing remains but to recognise the resumption of <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>) in the clause "The mountains shake at Thy presence," in which case <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>b-64:2((<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-3</a>) forms a grand period rounded off palindromically after Isaiah's peculiar style. </body></html>
