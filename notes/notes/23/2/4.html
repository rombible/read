In reliance on His wisdom and equity, nations would refer their disputes to His decision instead of the arbitrament of war.

But this passage foretels that even an external and general peace will be established in the world under the reign of the Messiah, which undoubtedly, in due time, will take place, namely, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and all Israel shall be saved, and both Jews and Gentiles shall be united together in one fold, under Christ their great Shepherd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall judge - Or he shall exercise the office of a judge, or umpire. This "literally" refers to the God of Jacob <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, though it is clear that the meaning is, that he will do it by the Messiah, or under his reign. One office of a judge is to decide controversies; to put an end to litigations, and thus to promote peace. The connection shows that this is the meaning here. Nations that are contending shall be brought to peace by the influence of the reign of the Messiah, and shall beat their swords into plowshares. In other words, the influence of the reign of the Messiah shall put a period to wars, and reduce contending nations to peace.<p>And shall rebuke - Shall "reprove" them for their contentions and strifes.<p>Lowth: 'Shall work conviction in many peoples.'<p>Noyes: 'He shall be a judge of the nations,<p>And an umpire of many kingdoms.'<p>He shall show them the evil of war; and by reproving them for those wicked passions which cause wars, shall promote universal peace. This the gospel everywhere does; and the tendency of it, if obeyed, would be to produce universal peace. In accordance with predictions like these, the Messiah is called the Prince of Peace <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; and it is said that of his peace there shall be no end; <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.<p>And they shall beat ... - They shall change the arts of war to those of peace; or they shall abandon the pursuits of war for the mild and useful arts of husbandry; compare <a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>. A similar prophecy is found in <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>. The following extracts may serve to illustrate this passage: 'The Syrian plow, which was probably used in all the regions around, is a very simple frame, and commonly so light, that a man of moderate strength might carry it in one hand. Volney states that in Syria it is often nothing else than the branch of a tree, cut below a bifurcation, and used without wheels. The plowshare is a piece of iron, broad but not large, which tips the end of the shaft. So much does it resemble the short sword used by the ancient warriors, that it may, with very little trouble, be converted into that deadly weapon; and when the work of destruction is over, reduced again to its former shape, and applied to the purposes of agriculture.'<p>Their spears - Spears were much used in war. They were made of wood, with a sharpened piece of iron or other metal attached to the end. The pruning-hook, made for cutting the limbs of vines or trees, is, in like manner, a long piece of wood with a crooked knife attached to it. Hence, it was easy to convert the one into the other.<p>Pruning-hooks - Hooks or long knives for trimming vines. The word here, however, means anything employed in "reaping or mowing," a sickle, or a scythe, or any instrument to "cut with," as well as a pruning-hook. These figures, as images of peace, are often used by the prophets. Micah M<a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a> has added to this description of peace in Isaiah, the following:<p>But they shall sit<p>Every man under his vine,<p>And under his fig-tree;<p>And none shall make them afraid:<p>For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. judge&#8212;as a sovereign umpire, settling all controversies (compare Isa 11:4). Lowth translates "work," "conviction."<p>plowshares&#8212;in the East resembling a short sword (Isa 9:6, 7; Zec 9:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall judge among the nations; </span> Christ shall set up and use his authority among and over all nations, not only giving laws to them, as other rulers do, but doing that which no other powers can do, Convincing their minds and consciences, conquering and changing their hearts, and ordering their lives. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall rebuke; </span> either verbally, by his word and Spirit reproving or convincing the world of sin; or really, by his judgments upon his implacable enemies, which obstruct the propagation of the gospel.

This was the design of the gospel in all, and the effect of it in those that rightly received it. And that war and dissension which was occasioned by the preaching of the gospel, as was foretold, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/10-21.htm" title="And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.">Matthew 10:21</a>,22</span>, it was wholly accidental, by reason of men’s corrupt interests and lusts, which the gospel opposed; and it was not amongst those who received the gospel in the love of it, but between them and those who were either open enemies or false friends to them and to the gospel. But if this place be understood of an external and general peace which was to be in the world in the days of the Messias, this also may in due time be verified, when all Israel shall be saved, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and both Jews and Gentiles shall be united together into one fold, under Christ their great Shepherd; all which is prophesied and promised, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a> Ro 11</span>, and elsewhere. For it is not necessary that all the prophecies concerning the kingdom of the Messias should be accomplished in an instant, or at the beginning of it; but it is sufficient if they be fulfilled before the end of it. And some of them do manifestly belong to the last days of that kingdom. And therefore there is no truth nor weight in that argument which the Jews bring from this place against our Messias, because of those wars that have hitherto been and still are amongst Christians; for this doth not prove that these wars shall never cease, or that there shall not be such a peace in the world as they understand before the end of Christ’s kingdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall judge among the nations,.... Or, "it shall judge"; either the mountain of the Lord's house, as Abarbinel thinks, that is, the church; for in the spiritual reign of Christ, in the latter day, the judgment shall be given to the saints of the most High, and they shall possess the kingdom; the power of civil government will be in their hands, and they shall judge the world; for kings will then be nursing fathers to them, and queens nursing mothers. Or the law and word of the Lord, the Gospel, which judges men now, and declares who are condemned, and who are not; and will judge them at the last day: or, "he shall judge", that is, the Messiah, as Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech interpret it; he shall be King over all the earth; the kingdoms of this world will become his, and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the rivers to the end of the earth: <p>and shall rebuke many people; either the church shall rebuke by her ministers, whose work it is to reprove and rebuke for and to convince of both immorality and error; or, the word preached by them, which is the means of the conviction and conversion of sinners; or, Christ by his Spirit, whose office it is to reprove and convince the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. It is a prophecy of numerous conversions among the Gentiles, in the latter day: <p>and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: instruments of war shall be no more used, but shall be turned into instruments of husbandry, much more advantageous and useful to mankind. <p>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. This clearly proves that this prophecy belongs to future times; for this has never yet had its accomplishment in any sense; not in a literal sense; for though there was an universal peace all the world over, at the birth of Christ, in the times of Augustus Caesar, yet there afterwards were, as our Lord foretold there would be, wars, and rumours of wars, and nation should rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and so it has been, more or less, ever since; nor in a spiritual sense, for though Christ has made peace by the blood of his cross, and came and preached it by his ministers, and wherever the Gospel of peace takes place, it makes men of peaceable dispositions, and reconciles them, as to God and Christ, and the way of salvation by him, so to one another; and it is peace saints are called to, and, when grace is in exercise, it rules in their hearts; and yet there have been sad contentions and quarrels among the people of God, and which yet still continue; but in the latter day glory, or spiritual reign of Christ, this prophecy will be fulfilled in every sense; for after the hour of temptation is over, that shall try all the earth, after the slaying of the witnesses and their rising, after the battle at Armageddon, when the beast and false prophet will be taken and cast alive into the lake of fire, there will be no more wars in the world, nor any persecution of the saints; and then will the peaceable kingdom of Christ appear, and all his subjects, and the members of his church, will live in the utmost unity and harmony together; they shall no more envy and vex one another; and of this peace there will be no end, <a href="/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a> these words are applied to the times of the Messiah, both by ancient (q) and modern (r) Jews. <p>(q) T.

The False Glory of Israel to be annihilated by the Glory of Jehovah in a Day of Judgment<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage may be divided into three brief sections:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/2-5.htm" title="O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD....">Isaiah 2:5-9</a></span>). After a transition verse (5, see below), the prophet proceeds, in an impassioned appeal to Jehovah, to contrast the actual condition of His people with the ideal set forth in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it....">Isaiah 2:2-4</a></span>. The city destined to be the source of light and truth to all nations is at present a receptacle for the darkest and most degrading errors of heathenism. Having surveyed the symptoms of apostasy and ungodly pride which are everywhere around him—foreign superstitions (6), display of wealth (7), confidence in military resources (7), idolatry (8)—he gives utterance to the conviction borne in upon his mind, that the sin of the nation is unpardonable (9). Then follows,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ii. (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/2-10.htm" title="Enter into the rock, and hide you in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty....">Isaiah 2:10-17</a></span>). A powerful description of the physical convulsions which mark the great “Day of Jehovah.” The conception seems to combine the features of the earthquake with those of the thunderstorm; it is a judgment directed against all that is “high and lofty” (12); i.e. everything, whether in nature (13 f.) or in human civilisation (15 f.), which seems to lift its head against the majesty of Jehovah (11, 17).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iii. In <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/2-18.htm" title="And the idols he shall utterly abolish....">Isaiah 2:18-21</a></span> the prophet returns to the subject of idolatry, describing the sudden despair and ignominious discomfiture “in that day” of all who put their trust in images. The last verse then sums up in general terms the lesson of the preceding prophecy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5</span> is apparently a transition verse (cf. <a href="/micah/4-5.htm" title="For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.">Micah 4:5</a>), “Since this great destiny is ours, O House of Jacob, let us at least for ourselves rise to the height of our privileges. But how vain is the exhortation!

But neither of these views is convincing enough to remove the impression that <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it....">Isaiah 2:2-4</a></span> are not the original introduction to 6 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">light of the Lord</span>] Not the “light of His countenance” (as <a href="/psalms/89-15.htm" title="Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance.">Psalm 89:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm" title="For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you had a favor to them.">Psalm 44:3</a>), but of His Revelation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/51-4.htm" title="Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.">Isaiah 51:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall judge among the nations</span>. This is clearly not yet fulfilled. How God shall ultimately "judge among the nations," or rather "between nation and nation," is a mystery which only the future can reveal. It has been supposed that "by his providential retributions he will decide those international questions out of which war ordinarily springs" (Kay). But it would seem to be at least as likely that he will bring the nations to such a pitch of wisdom and moderation, that they will voluntarily discard war, and agree to decide any disputes that arise by means of arbiters. The arbiter would then, like other judges, represent God, and "by him decree justice" (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall rebuke</span>. Rosenm&uuml;ller translates, "Arbiter pacts sit;" Cheyne, "shall arbitrate." Here again, as in ver. 3, "people" should be "peoples." <span class="cmt_word">They shall beat</span>, etc. On a sudden call to war, nations "beat their ploughshares into swords, and their pruning-hooks into spears" (<a href="/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>). They will do the reverse "in the latter days," when God shall have "made wars to cease" (<a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>) and "speak peace unto the nations" (<a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a> declares how God's judgment of destruction would fall upon all of these. The v. is introduced with an explanatory "for" (Chi): "For they become ashamed of the terebinths, in which ye had your delight; and ye must blush for the gardens, in which ye took pleasure." The terebinths and gardens (the second word with the article, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, first binharim, then banneharim) are not referred to as objects of luxury, as Hitzig and Drechsler assume, but as unlawful places of worship and objects of worship (see <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>). They are both of them frequently mentioned by the prophets in this sense (<a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>): Cha&#770;mor and ba&#770;char are also the words commonly applied to an arbitrary choice of false gods (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-24.htm">Isaiah 41:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>), and bosh min is the general phrase used to denote the shame which falls upon idolaters, when the worthlessness of their idols becomes conspicuous through their impotence. On the difference between bosh and Cha&#770;pher, see the comm. on <a href="/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>.<p>(Note: It is perfectly certain that Cha&#770;pher (Arab. Chaphira, as distinguished from Cha&#770;phar, hafara, to dig) signifies to blush, erubescere; but the combination of bosh and ya&#770;bash (ba&#770;da), which would give albescere or expallescere (to turn white or pale) as the primary idea of bosh, has not only the Arabic use of bayyada and ibyadda (to rejoice, be made glad) against it, but above all the dialectic bechath, bahita (bahuta), which, when taken in connection with bethath (batta), points rather to the primary idea of being cut off (abscindi: cf., spes abscissa). See Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, i.263.)<p>The word elim is erroneously translated "idols" in the Septuagint and other ancient versions. The feeling which led to this, however, was a correct one, since the places of worship really stand for the idols worshipped in those places.<p>(Note: With regard to the derivation, e&#770;lim, whether used in the sense of strong men, or gods, or rams, or terebinths, is still but one word, derived from &#305;&#772;l or u&#772;l, so that in all three senses it may be written either with or without Yod. Nevertheless elim in the sense of "rams" only occurs without Yod in <a href="/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>. In the sense of "gods" it is always written without Yod; in that of "strong men" with Yod. In the singular the name of the terebinth is always written elah without Yod; in the plural, however, it is written either with or without. But this no more presupposes a singular e&#770;l (ayil) in common use, than be&#770;tzim presupposes a singular be&#770;ts (bayits); still the word e&#770;l with Yod does occur once, viz., in <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>. Alla&#770;h and allo&#772;n, an oak, also spring from the same root, namely a&#770;lal  equals  il; just as in Arabic both &#305;&#772;l and ill are used for e&#772;l (God); and a&#770;l and ill, in the sense of relationship, point to a similar change in the form of the root.)<p>The excited state of the prophet at the close of his prophecy is evinced by his abrupt leap from an exclamation to a direct address (Ges. 137, Anm. 3). </body></html>
