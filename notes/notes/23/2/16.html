The combination of the phrase with “the ships of Tarshish” suggests the inference that it includes the works of art which were brought by them from East and West. For these, it would seem, there was a mania among the higher classes in Jerusalem, like that which in later times has fastened upon china, or pictures, or carvings in ivory. So the ships of Solomon brought gold and silver, and “ivory and apes and peacocks” (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm" title="For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">1Kings 10:22</a>).

It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God.

It is evident that "Tarshish" was some distant land from which was imported silver, iron, lead, tin, etc. It is now generally agreed that "Tartessus" in Spain is referred to by the Tarshish of Scripture. Bruce, however, supposes that it was in Africa, south of Abyssinia; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>. That it was in the "west" is evident from <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, it is mentioned as an important place of trade; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>, it is said that silver was procured there; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>, it is said that iron, lead, silver, and tin, were imported from it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a>, it is said that the ships of Tarshish returned every three years, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes and peacocks. These are productions chiefly of India, but they might have been obtained in trade during the voyage. In <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>, the phrase, 'ships of Tarshish,' seems to denote ships that were bound on long voyages, and it is probable that they came to denote a particular kind of ships adapted to long voyages, in the same way as the word "Indiaman" does with us. The precise situation of "Tarshish" is not necessary to be known in order to understand the passage here. The phrase, 'ships of Tarshish,' denotes clearly ships employed in foreign trade, and in introducing articles of commerce, and particularly of luxury. The meaning is, that God would embarrass, and destroy this commerce; that his judgments would be on their articles of luxury, The Septuagint renders it, 'and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every beautiful appearance of ships.' The Targum, 'and upon those who dwell in the isles of the sea, and upon those who dwell in beautiful palaces.'<p>And upon all pleasant pictures - Margin, 'pictures of desire;' that is, such as it should be esteemed desirable to possess, and gaze upon; pictures of value or beauty.

The word rendered 'pictures,' &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  s'ek&#305;&#770;yo&#770;th, denotes properly "sights," or objects to be looked at; and does not designate "paintings" particularly, but everything that was designed for ornament or luxury. Whether the art of painting was much known among the Hebrews, it is not now possible to determine. To a certain extent, it may be presumed to have been practiced; but the meaning of this place is, that the divine judgment should rest on all that was designed for mere ornament and luxury; and, from the description in the previous verses, there can be no doubt that such ornaments would abound. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Tarshish&#8212;Tartessus in southwest Spain, at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, near Gibraltar. It includes the adjoining region: a Phœnician colony; hence its connection with Palestine and the Bible (2Ch 9:21). The name was also used in a wide sense for the farthest west, as our West Indies (Isa 66:19; Ps 48:7; 72:10). "Ships of Tarshish" became a phrase for richly laden and far-voyaging vessels. The judgment shall be on all that minister to man's luxury (compare Re 18:17-19).<p>pictures&#8212;ordered to be destroyed (Nu 33:52). Still to be seen on the walls of Nineveh's palaces. It is remarkable that whereas all other ancient civilized nations, Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome, have left monuments in the fine arts, Judea, while rising immeasurably above them in the possession of "the living oracles," has left none of the former. The fine arts, as in modern Rome, were so often associated with polytheism, that God required His people in this, as in other respects, to be separate from the nations (De 4:15-18). But Vulgate translation is perhaps better, "All that is beautiful to the sight"; not only paintings, but all luxurious ornaments.

They were first built by the Phœnicians for the long voyage to Tartessus (Tarshish) in Spain; but the name (like our “Indiaman”) was applied to large ships whatever their destination. Since the harbour of Elath was at this time in the possession of Judah the prophet may allude to fleets sailing thence to the East in the service of Jotham. More likely, however, he is thinking of the Phœnician argosies which he had seen in the Mediterranean. <span class="ital">pleasant pictures</span>] An obscure expression, found only here. The noun is thought to be derived from a verb meaning “to see,” but this lends itself to a variety of senses. The rendering of A.V. seems to rest on the Vulg., “omne quod visu pulchrum est”; or perhaps like that of R.V. (“imagery”) on the analogy of a cognate Heb. noun (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm" title="Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm" title="A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.">Proverbs 25:11</a>); “watch-towers” (R.V. marg.) is based on the Peshito (see Cheyne, <span class="ital">Comm.</span> II. p. 137),<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the ships of Tarshish.</span> "Ships of Tarshish" meant originally "ships built to sail to Tarshish;" but was used by the later writers for ships of a certain class or size (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>). Tarshish was Tartessus, in Spain, and voyages thither were regarded as long and dangerous (Herod., 1:163). Consequently, the ships which were built for the Tartessian trade were of unusual size and strength. Uzziah had "built [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> rebuilt] Elath," in the eastern arm of the Red Sea, early in his reign (<a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), and no doubt maintained a fleet there, as Jehoshaphat had done (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Elath remained in the possession of the Jews till the reign of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin, and restored to Edom (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all pleasant pictures</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">all pleasant imagery</span>. The exact word here translated "pictures" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament; but a cognate word is not uncommon. From the passages in which this cognate word occurs (especially <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>), it is concluded that works of art, of some sort or other, are intended. More than this can scarcely be determined. Dr. Kay thinks the term to include "sculptures and fresco-paintings." Mr. Cheyne translates "all delightful works of imagery." The sentiment is that the judgment of God will fall on the most valued contents of palaces and grand houses, no less than upon the forests and the mountains, the fortified places, and the national navy. <span class="accented">All</span> wilt be involved in one sweeping destruction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It was a state ripe for judgment, from which, therefore, the prophet could at once proceed, without any further preparation, to the proclamation of judgment itself."Thus, then, men are bowed down, and lords are brought low; and forgive them - no, that Thou wilt not." The consecutive futures depict the judgment, as one which would follow by inward necessity from the worldly and ungodly glory of the existing state of things. The future is frequently used in this way (for example, in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.). It was a judgment by which small and great, i.e., the people in all its classes, were brought down from their false eminence. "Men" and "lords" (a&#770;da&#770;m and ish, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-15.htm">Isaiah 5:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a>, and like &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; in the Attic dialect), i.e., men who were lost in the crowd, and men who rose above it - all of them the judgment would throw down to the ground, and that without mercy (<a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>). The prophet expresses the conviction (al as in <a href="/2_kings/6-27.htm">2 Kings 6:27</a>), that on this occasion God neither could nor would take away the sin by forgiving it. There was nothing left for them, therefore, but to carry out the command of the prophet in <a href="/isaiah/2-10.htm">Isaiah 2:10</a> : "Creep into the rock, and bury thyself in the dust, before the terrible look of Jehovah, and before the glory of His majesty." The glorious nation would hide itself most ignominiously, when the only true glory of Jehovah, which had been rejected by it, was manifested in judgment. They would conceal themselves in holes of the rocks, as if before a hostile army (<a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-11.htm">1 Samuel 14:11</a>), and bury themselves with their faces in the sand, as if before the fatal simo&#772;m of the desert, that they might not have to bear this intolerable sight. And when Jehovah manifested Himself in this way in the fiery glance of judgment, the result summed up in <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a> must follow: "The people's eyes of haughtiness are humbled, and the pride of their lords is bowed down; and Jehovah, He only, stands exalted in that day." The result of the process of judgment is expressed in perfects: nisgab is the third pers. praet., not the participle: Jehovah "is exalted," i.e., shows Himself as exalted, whilst the haughty conduct of the people is brought down (sha&#770;phel is a verb, not an adjective; it is construed in the singular by attraction, and either refers to a&#770;da&#770;m, man or people: Ges. 148, 1; or what is more probable, to the logical unity of the compound notion which is taken as subject, the constr. ad synesin s. sensum: Thiersch, 118), and the pride of the lords is bowed down (shach  equals  sha&#770;chach, <a href="/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>). The first strophe of the proclamation of judgment appended to the prophetic saying in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> is here brought to a close. The second strophe reaches to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm">Isaiah 2:17</a>, where <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a> is repeated as a concluding verse. </body></html>
