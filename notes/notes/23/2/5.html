Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O house of Jacob - This is a direct address, or exhortation, of the prophet to the Jews. It is made in view of the fact that God had gracious purposes toward them. He intended to distinguish them by making them the source of blessings to all nations. As this was to be their high destiny, he exhorts them to devote themselves to him, and to live to his honor. The word "house" here means the "family, or nation." The phrase is applied to the Jews because their tribes were descended from the twelve sons of Jacob.<p>Let us walk - Let us "live." The word "walk" is often used to denote human life or conduct; compare <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>, ...<p>In the light of the Lord - The sense of this is: Let us obey the commandments of Yahweh; or, as the Chaldee expresses it, 'Let us walk in the doctrine of the law of the Lord.' The idea may be thus expressed: 'Let us not walk in the darkness and error of sin and idolatry, but in the light or instruction which God sheds upon us by his law. He teaches us what we should do, and let us obey him.' "Light" is often, in the Scriptures, thus put for instruction, or teaching; compare the note at <a href="/matthew/4-16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; note at <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; also, note at <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This is either an exhortation of the prophet to the men of his generation, to attend to the light of the law, which the Lord had given them, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi; or rather, as the Targum and Jarchi suggest, an exhortation of the nations to the people of Israel, and are indeed the words of the converted Gentiles to the people of the Jews, being concerned for their conversion and spiritual welfare, as will appear in the latter day; when they will not only encourage one another to go up to the house of the Lord, as in the preceding verses, but will be very solicitous that the Jews, the posterity of Jacob, share with them in all that light and glory that shall be risen upon Zion; as follows: <p>come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord; meaning either Christ, in whom the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is given, and the glory of all the perfections of the divine nature is displayed; who is that light that dwells with the Lord, was sent forth by him, and came into this world as the light of it, and is given for a light to the Gentiles, as well as the glory of the people of Israel; and who is the author of all light; of corporeal light, in the first creation; of the sun, moon, and stars; of the light of nature in every man; of the light of the Gospel of the grace of God; of the spiritual light of grace in the hearts of his people; and of the light of eternal glory: or else the Gospel is intended, called the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a> by which some are only notionally enlightened, and some spiritually and savingly, when it is attended with the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ: or rather, the light of the latter day glory, which includes the other two; when Christ and his Gospel will be more clearly revealed and seen, not only by the watchmen, who will see eye to eye, but by all the saints; when the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun sevenfold as the light of seven days, and the whole earth shall be lightened with its glory, <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a> and to "walk" in this light, as it respects Christ, is to walk by faith in him, to go on in believing views of him, and to walk in imitation of him, and as he directs; and as it respects the Gospel, it is to embrace it, profess it, hold it fast, and hold it forth; and to walk as that prescribes and guides, and as becomes it; and to walk as children of the light, wisely and circumspectly; worthy of the calling of God, of the grace he calls by, and the kingdom he calls to: and to walk in the light of the latter day glory is to enjoy it, and share in all the blessings of it, with perseverance therein, through the grace of God; and such walking is pleasant and comfortable; such shall have the communion of God and Christ, and fellowship one with another, and at last enjoy the light of life.  <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> walk in the light of the LORD.</span><p>(l) Seeing the Gentiles will be ready, make haste, and show them the way to worship God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> - THE CONTRAST OF THE PRESENT WITH THE FUTURE. Having shown to Israel the vision of a far-distant future, when holiness and peace would reign upon the earth, and "the mountain of the Lord's house" would draw all men into it, the prophet returns to things as they are - first exhorting Israel to "walk in the light of Jehovah' (ver. 5), and then showing how far they have withdrawn from the light; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by magical practices (ver. 6); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by commercial greed (vers. 6, 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by ostentation and luxury (ver. 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> by idolatry (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such being the case, punishment must come - mean and great must be equally brought low (ver. 9) - the people must fly to their cave-fastnesses (ver. 10), and hide themselves; they must be humiliated to the uttermost (ver. 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of Jacob</span>.

"For ye shall become like a terebinth with withered leaves, and like a garden that hath no water." Their prosperity is distroyed, so that they resemble a terebinth withered as to its leaves, which in other cases are always green (nobleth &#8219;aleah, genitives connection according to (Ges. 112, 2).
