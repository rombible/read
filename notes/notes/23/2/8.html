Vitringa, however, Dr. Waterland, and Bishop Lowth, with many others, consider this verse, not as describing their idolatry, but as a predicting the punishment which God was about to bring upon them for it; and therefore translate it, in perfect consistency with the Hebrew, in the future tense, thus: <span class="ital">Therefore the mean man shall be bowed down, and the mighty man shall be humbled; and thou wilt not forgive them. </span>“They bowed themselves down to their idols, therefore shall they be bowed down, and brought low, under the avenging hand of God.” — Bishop Lowth.

Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their land also is full of idols - compare <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>. Vitringa supposes that Isaiah here refers to idols that were kept in private houses, as Uzziah and Jotham were worshippers of the true God, and in their reign idolatry was not publicly practiced. It is certain, however, that though Uzziah himself did right, and was disposed to worship the true God, yet he did not effectually remove idolatry from the land. The high places were not removed, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on them; <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>. It was customary with the pagan to keep in their houses "Penates or household gods" - small images, which they regarded as "protectors," and to which they paid homage: compare <a href="/genesis/30-19.htm">Genesis 30:19</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>.

The historians declare that both Uzziah and Jotham maintained the worship of Jehovah and disallowed idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3, 34</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-4.htm">2 Chronicles 26:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>), so that we must regard the idol-worship of the time as an irregular and private practice. (It is, perhaps, alluded to in <a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>; and the fact of its prevalence is stated in <a href="/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>; <a href="/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>.) Perhaps Bishop Lowth is right in regarding it as mainly a continuation of the old private teraphim worship ('Notes,' p. 25). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The subject of the borrowed prophecy is Israel's future glory: "And it cometh to pass at the end of the days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be set at the top of the mountains, and exalted over hills; and all nations pour unto it." The expression "the last days" (acharith hayyamim, "the end of the days"), which does not occur anywhere else in Isaiah, is always used in an eschatological sense. It never refers to the course of history immediately following the time being, but invariably indicates the furthest point in the history of this life - the point which lies on the outermost limits of the speaker's horizon. This horizon was a very fluctuating one. The history of prophecy is just the history of its gradual extension, and of the filling up of the intermediate space. In Jacob's blessing (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) the conquest of the land stood in the foreground of the acharith or last days, and the perspective was regulated accordingly. But here in Isaiah the acharith contained no such mixing together of events belonging to the more immediate and the most distant future. It was therefore the last time in its most literal and purest sense, commencing with the beginning of the New Testament aeon, and terminating at its close (compare <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a> and the Revelation). The prophet here predicted that the mountain which bore the temple of Jehovah, and therefore was already in dignity the most exalted of all mountains, would. one day tower in actual height above all the high places of the earth. The basaltic mountains of Bashan, which rose up in bold peaks and columns, might now look down with scorn and contempt upon the small limestone hill which Jehovah had chosen (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16-17</a>); but this was an incongruity which the last times would remove, by making the outward correspond to the inward, the appearance to the reality and the intrinsic worth. That this is the prophet's meaning is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>, where the temple mountain looks gigantic to the prophet, and also by <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>, where all Jerusalem is described as towering above the country round about, which would one day become a plain. The question how this can possibly take place in time, since it presupposes a complete subversion of the whole of the existing order of the earth's surface, is easily answered. The prophet saw the new Jerusalem of the last days on this side, and the new Jerusalem of the new earth on the other (<a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>), blended as it were together, and did not distinguish the one from the other. But whilst we thus avoid all unwarrantable spiritualizing, it still remains a question what meaning the prophet attached to the word b'rosh ("at the top"). Did he mean that Moriah would one day stand upon the top of the mountains that surrounded it (as in <a href="/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>), or that it would stand at their head (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/21-12.htm">1 Kings 21:12</a>; <a href="/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>)? The former is Hofmann's view, as given in his Weissagung und Erfllung, ii.:217: "he did not indeed mean that the mountains would be piled up one upon the other, and the temple mountain upon the top, but that the temple mountain would appear to float upon the summit of the others." But as the expression "will be set" (nacon) does not favour this apparently romantic exaltation, and b'rosh occurs more frequently in the sense of "at the head" than in that of "on the top," I decide for my own part in favour of the second view, though I agree so far with Hofmann, that it is not merely an exaltation of the temple mountain in the estimation of the nations that is predicted, but a physical and external elevation also. And when thus outwardly exalted, the divinely chosen mountain would become the rendezvous and centre of unity for all nations. They would all "flow unto it" (na&#770;har, a denom. verb, from na&#770;ha&#770;r, a river, as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>). It is the temple of Jehovah which, being thus rendered visible to nations afar off, exerts such magnetic attraction, and with such success. Just as at a former period men had been separated and estranged from one another in the plain of Shinar, and thus different nations had first arisen; so would the nations at a future period assemble together on the mountain of the house of Jehovah, and there, as members of one family, live together in amity again. And as Babel (confusion, as its name signifies) was the place whence the stream of nations poured into all the world; so would Jerusalem (the city of peace) become the place into which the stream of nations would empty itself, and where all would be reunited once more. At the present time there was only one people, viz., Israel, which made pilgrimages to Zion on the great festivals, but it would be very different then. </body></html>
