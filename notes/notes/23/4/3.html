The Jews that survived the Babylonish captivity, and returned into their own land, were greatly reformed, especially in one point, they relapsed no more into idolatry: and in other respects also a spirit of religion was revived among them.

Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that is left in Zion - This "properly" refers to the remnant that should remain after the mass of the people should be cut off by wars, or be borne into captivity. If it refer to the few that would come back from Babylon, it means that they would be reformed, and would be a generation different from their fathers - which was undoubtedly true. If it refer, as the connection seems to indicate, to the times of the Messiah, then it speaks of those who are 'left,' while the great mass of the nation would be unbelievers, and would be destroyed. The mass of the nation would be cut off, and the remnant that was left would be holy; that is, all true friends of the Messiah would be holy.<p>Shall be called holy - That is, shall "be" holy. The expression 'to be called,' is often used in the Scriptures as synonymous with 'to be.'<p>Every one that is written among the living - The Jews were accustomed to register the names of all the people. Those names were written in a catalogue, or register, of each tribe or family. To be written in that book, or register, meant to be alive, for when a death occurred, the name was stricken out; <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>. The expression came also to denote all who were truly the friends of God; they whose names are written in "his" book - the book of life. In this sense it is used in the New Testament; <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>. In this sense it is understood in this place by the Chaldee Par.: 'Every one shall be called holy who is written to eternal life; he shall see the consolation of Jerusalem.' If the reference here is to the Messiah, then the passage denotes that under the reign of the Messiah, all who should be found enrolled as his followers, would be holy. An effectual separation would subsist between them and the mass of the people. They would be "enrolled" as his friends, and they would be a separate, holy community; compare <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. left in Zion&#8212;equivalent to the "escaped of Israel" (Isa 4:2).<p>shall be called&#8212;shall be (Isa 9:6).<p>holy&#8212;(Isa 52:1; 60:21; Re 21:27).<p>written&#8212;in the book of life, antitypically (Php 4:3; Re 3:5; 17:8).

These are the persons to whom Christ appears beautiful and glorious, excellent and comely, who will be left, and remain in Zion and Jerusalem; by which is meant the Gospel church, or church as in the latter day; in which these shall continue, abide by the truths and doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances thereof, and persevere unto the end; even when Christ shall take his fan in his hand, and purge his floor of the chaff; when the filth of the daughter of Zion shall be washed away by the spirit of judgment and burning, as in the following verse <a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>; when it shall be a shocking and shaking time in the churches, and the hour of temptation shall come, that shall try those that dwell upon earth; these shall be pillars in the temple of God, that shall never go out. The doctrine of the saints' final perseverance is held forth in these words, as their sanctification and election are in the following clauses, which secure it to them: they <p>shall be called holy: in the original text it is added, "unto him"; either the person left, it shall be said to him, that he is holy or rather the branch; and Kimchi interprets it, "because of him"; for these are accounted holy, through the imputation of the holiness of Christ unto them; and they are really and inherently holy, through the grace of Christ implanted in them; they are called to be holy, to be saints, and they are called with a holy calling, and unto holiness; and, in effectual calling, principles of grace and holiness are wrought in them, and which appear in their lives and conversations. The principal meaning seems to be, that those who shall hold fast their profession, and hold out, and persevere through the trying dispensation in the latter day, they shall be remarkably holy; they shall shine in the beauties of holiness; holiness shall be upon their horses' bells, and they themselves shall be holiness unto the Lord, <a href="/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>. <p>even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem; or, "everyone that is written unto life" (m), that is, unto eternal life, as the Targum paraphrases the words; and it is the same with being ordained unto eternal life, <a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a> or predestination unto life, which is a writing of the names of God's elect in the book of life: this writing is God's writing, it is his act and deed, the act of God the Father, and an eternal one, flowing from his sovereign will and pleasure, and is sure, certain, and unfrustrable; what is written is written, and can never be altered; and election being signified by writing names in a book, shows it to be particular and personal, not of nations, churches, and bodies of men, but of particular persons; and that it is irrespective of faith, holiness, and good works, and entirely unconditional; it is of naked persons, and not as so and so qualified; and that it is distinguishing of some, and not others, whom God has an exact knowledge of, and calls by name: and this writing is "unto life", or "lives", as in the original text; not to a temporal life, but to a spiritual and eternal one; in consequence of which, such become living, holy, and persevering Christians in Jerusalem, in the church of God, and shall be admitted into the New Jerusalem, and none else, <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a> and so Jarchi interprets it, everyone that is written to the life of the world to come, or to eternal life, shall be in Jerusalem; and the Targum adds, <p>"and he shall see the consolation of Jerusalem;'' <p>from hence it appears that election is the source and spring of holiness, and the security of the saints final perseverance, <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a> and is not a licentious doctrine, but a doctrine according to godliness; holiness is a fruit and evidence of it; whoever are written or ordained to life become holy; and these being brought to Zion, remain there, and persevere unto the end. <p>(m)   "quicunque fuerit scriptus ad vitam", Piscator; "omnis scriptus ad vitam", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall come to pass, <i>that he that is</i> left in Zion, and <i>he that</i> remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, <i>even</i> every one that is <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> written among the living in Jerusalem:</span><p>(e) He alludes to the book of life, of which read Ex 32:32 meaning God's secret counsel, in which his elect are predestinated to life everlasting.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

"On that day the Lord will put away the show of the ankle-clasps, and of the head-bands, and of the crescents; the ear-rings, and the arm-chains, and the light veils; the diadems, and the stepping-chains, and the girdles, and the smelling-bottles, and the amulets; the finger-rings, and the nose-rings; the gala-dresses, and the sleeve-frocks, and the wrappers, and the pockets; the hand-mirrors, and the Sindu-cloths, and the turbans, and the gauze mantles." The fullest explanation of all these articles of female attire is to be found in N. W. Schrder's work, entitled Commentarius de vestitu mulierum Hebraearum ad Jes. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, Ludg. Batav 1745 (a quarto volume), and in that of Ant. Theod. Hartmann, consisting of three octavo volumes, and entitled Die Hebrerin am Putztische und als Braut (The Jewess at the Toilet-table, and as Bride, 1809-10); to which we may also add, Saalschtz, Archaeologie, chapter iii., where he treats of the dresses of men and women. It was not usually Isaiah's custom to enter into such minute particulars. Of all the prophets, Ezekiel was the one most addicted to this, as we may see, for example, from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>. And even in other prophecies against the women we find nothing of the kind again (<a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>.; <a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>.). But in this instance, the enumeration of the female ornaments is connected with that of the state props in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-3</a>, and that of the lofty and exalted in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13-16</a>, so as to form a trilogy, and has its own special explanation in that boundless love of ornament which had become prevalent in the time of Uzziah-Jotham. It was the prophet's intention to produce a ludicrous, but yet serious impression, as to the immeasurable luxury which really existed; and in the prophetic address, his design throughout is to bring out the glaring contrast between the titanic, massive, worldly glory, in all its varied forms, and that true, spiritual, and majestically simple glory, whose reality is manifested from within outwards. In fact, the theme of the whole address is the way of universal judgment leading on from the false glory to the true. The general idea of tiphereth (show: rendered "bravery" in Eng. ver.) which stands at the head and includes the whole, points to the contrast presented by a totally different tiphereth which follows in <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>. In explaining each particular word, we must be content with what is most necessary, and comparatively the most certain. "Ankle-clasps" (aca&#770;sim): these were rings of gold, silver, or ivory, worn round the ankles; hence the denom. verb (icces) in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>, to make a tinkling sound with these rings. "Head-bands," or "frontlets" (shebisim, from sha&#770;bas  equals  sha&#770;batz: plectere), were plaited bands of gold or silver thread worn below the hair-net, and reaching from one ear to the other. There is some force, however, in the explanation which has been very commonly adopted since the time of Schrder, namely, that they were sun-like balls ( equals  shemisim), which were worn as ornaments round the neck, from the Arabic &#8219;sumeisa (&#8219;subeisa), a little sun. The "crescents" (saharonim) were little pendants of this kind, fastened round the neck and hanging down upon the breast (in <a href="/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a> we meet with them as ornaments hung round the camels' necks). Such ornaments are still worn by Arabian girls, who generally have several different kinds of them; the hila&#770;l, or new moon, being a symbol of increasing good fortune, and as such the most approved charm against the evil eye. "Ear-rings" (netiphoth, ear-drops): we meet with these in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, as an ornament worn by Midianitish kings. Hence the Arabic munattafe, a woman adorned with ear-rings. "Arm-chains:" sheroth, from sha&#770;ra, to twist. According to the Targum, these were chains worn upon the arm, or spangles upon the wrist, answering to the spangles upon the ankles. "Fluttering veils" (re'a&#770;loth, from ra&#770;'al, to hang loose): these were more expensive than the ordinary veils worn by girls, which were called tza'iph. <p>"Diadems" (pe'erim) are only mentioned in other parts of the Scriptures as being worn by men (e.g., by priests, bride-grooms, or persons of high rank). "Stepping-chains:" tze'a&#770;doth, from tze'a&#770;dah, a step; hence the chain worn to shorten and give elegance to the step. "Girdles:" kisshurim, from ka&#770;shar (Cingere), dress girdles, such as were worn by brides upon their wedding-day (compare <a href="/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a> with <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>); the word is erroneously rendered hair-pins (kalmasmezayyah) in the Targum. "Smelling-bottles:" botte hannephesh, holders of scent (nephesh, the breath of an aroma). "Amulets:" lechashim (from la&#770;chash, to work by incantations), gems or metal plates with an inscription upon them, which were worn as a protection as well as an ornament. "Finger-rings:" tabba&#770;'oth, from ta&#770;ba, to impress or seal, signet-rings worn upon the finger, corresponding to the Chotha&#770;m worn by men upon the breast suspended by a cord. "Nose-rings" (nizme&#770; ha&#770;aph) were fastened in the central division of the nose, and hung down over the mouth: they have been ornaments in common use in the East from the time of the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>) down to the present day. "Gala-dresses" (machala&#770;tsoth) are dresses not usually worn, but taken off when at home. "Sleeve-frocks" (ma'ata&#770;pha&#770;h): the second tunic, worn above the ordinary one, the Roman stola. "Wrappers" (mitpa&#770;choth, from ta&#770;phach, expandere), broad cloths wrapped round the body, such as Ruth wore when she crept in to Boaz in her best attire (<a href="/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). "Pockets" (Charitim) were for holding money (<a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>), which was generally carried by men in the girdle, or in a purse (Cis). "Hand-mirrors" (gilyonim): the Septuagint renders this &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;, sc. &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Lacedaemonian gauze or transparent dresses, which showed the nakedness rather than concealed it (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, retegere); but the better rendering is mirrors with handles, polished metal plates (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, polire), as gilla&#770;yon is used elsewhere to signify a smooth table. "Sindu-cloths" (sedinim), veils or coverings of the finest linen, viz., of Sindu or Hindu cloth (&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) - Sindu, the land of Indus, being the earlier name of India.<p>(Note: The Mishna (Kelim xxiv 13) mentions three different sedinin: night dresses, curtains, and embroidery. The sindon is frequently referred to as a covering wrapped round the person; and in b. Menachoth 41a, it is stated that the sindom is the summer dress, the sarbal (cloak) the winter dress, which may help to explain <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51-52</a>.)<p>"Turbans" (tseniphoth, from tsa&#770;naph, Convolvere), the head-dress composed of twisted cloths of different colours. "Gauze mantles" (redidim, from ra&#770;dad, extendere, tenuem facere), delicate veil-like mantles thrown over the rest of the clothes. Stockings and handkerchiefs are not mentioned: the former were first introduced into Hither Asia from Media long after Isaiah's time, and a Jerusalem lady no more thought of suing the latter than a Grecian or Roman lady did. Even the veil (burko) now commonly worn, which conceals the whole of the face with the exception of the eyes, did not form part of the attire of an Israelitish woman in the olden time.<p>(Note: Rashi, however, makes a different statement (Sabbath 65a), viz., that "Israelitish women in Arabia go out with veils which conceal the face, and those in Media with their mantles fastened about the mouth.")<p>The prophet enumerates twenty-one different ornaments: three sevens of a very bad kind, especially for the husbands of these state-dolls. There is no particular order observed in the enumeration, either from head to foot, or from the inner to the outer clothing; but they are arranged as much ad libitum as the dress itself. </body></html>
