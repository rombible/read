The prophet has not forgotten the daughters of Zion. Jehovah will wash away, as with the baptism of repentance, the “filth,” the moral uncleanness, that lay beneath their outward show of beauty. The “blood of Jerusalem,” in the next verse, has a wide range of meaning, from the “murders” of <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>, to the Moloch sacrifices in which the women had borne a conspicuous part (<a href="/psalms/106-38.htm" title="And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.">Psalm 106:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/22-2.htm" title="Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yes, you shall show her all her abominations.">Ezekiel 22:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</span>—The word for “spirit” is better taken in its more literal meaning, as <span class= "ital">breath </span>or <span class= "ital">blast, </span>as in <a href="/context/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>. The words indicate that the prophet saw in the “blood” of which he speaks a greater enormity than that of the daughters of Zion. The one might be washed away. The other needed, as it were, the “fiery baptism” of the wrath of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>.)

The Holy Spirit may well be called <span class="ital">a spirit of judgment, </span>because he executes judgment in the church, and in the consciences of men, convincing sinners of sin, leading them to judge and condemn themselves, and humbling them before God. And the same Spirit may be properly called a <span class="ital">spirit of burning, </span>because he burns up and consumes the dross which is in the church, and in the hearts of sinners, operates like refiners’ fire, purges believers as gold and silver are purged, (<a href="/malachi/3-3.htm" title="And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.">Malachi 3:3</a>,) inflames their souls with love to God and zeal for his glory, and transforms them into his holy nature and image. This was effectually done with respect to those Jews that embraced the gospel in the early days of Christianity. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the Lord - That is, "after" God has done this, then all that are written among the living shall be called holy. The prophet in this verse states the benefits of "affliction" in purifying the people of God. He had said, in the previous verse, that all who should be left in Zion should be called holy. He here states that "previous" to that, the defilement of the people would be removed by judgment.<p>Shall have washed away - The expression, "to wash," is often used to denote to "purify" in any way. In allusion to this fact is the beautiful promise in <a href="/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>.<p>The filth - This word here refers to their "moral" defilement - their pride, vanity, haughtiness; and perhaps to the idolatry and general sins of the people. As the prophet, however, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-23</a>, had particularly specified the sins of the female part of the Jewish people, the expression here probably refers especially to them, and to the judgments which were to come upon them; <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. It is not departing from the spirit of this passage to remark, that the church is purified, and true religion is often promoted, by God's humbling the pride and vanity of females. A love of excessive ornament; a fondness for dress and display; and an exhibition of great gaiety, often stand grievously in the way of pure religion.<p>The daughters of Zion - see <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>.<p>And shall have purged - This is synonymous with the expression "to wash." It means to purify, to remove, as one removes blood from the hands by washing.<p>Blood of Jerusalem - Crime, blood-guiltiness - particularly the crime of "oppression, cruelty," and "robbery," which the prophet <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a> had charged on them.<p>By the spirit of judgment - This refers, doubtless, to the "calamities," or "punishment," that would come upon the nation; principally, to the Babylonian captivity. After God should have humbled and reformed the nation by a series of judgments, then they who were purified by them should be called holy. The word "spirit" here cannot be shown to be the Holy Spirit; and especially as the Holy Spirit is not represented in the Scriptures as the agent in executing judgment. It perhaps would be best denoted by the word "influence," or "power." The word properly denotes "wind, air, motion" <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; then "breathing, exhalation, or breath" <a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; hence, it means the "soul;" and it means also God's "influence," or his putting forth his power and life-giving energy in animating and sustaining the universe; and also, as here, his putting forth any influence in accomplishing his works and designs.<p>And by the spirit of burning - "Fire" is often, in the Scriptures, the emblem of punishment, and also of purifying; compare the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11-12</a>; see <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. The Chaldee translates this, 'by the word of judgment, and by the word of consuming.' The reference is to the "punishments" which would be sent to purify the people "before" the coming of the Messiah.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

This filth likewise includes all false worship; all ordinances and institutions of men; all corruptions in the ordinances of Christ, baptism, and the Lord's supper; all forms and modes of worship that are not of God; all offices and officers, except bishops and deacons, which are of the man of sin; and all immorality and profaneness; and all wicked men, even all that offend and do iniquity, shall be taken out of Christ's kingdom and churches; there will be a thorough clearing of his floor of all filth, dirt, and chaff. <p>And shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof; that is, of the daughters of Jerusalem, particular churches, of which the Jerusalem above is the mother; for this is not to be understood literally of the city of Jerusalem, nor of the blood of Christ, and his servants, shed in it, purged away by the burning of it by the Romans; but of the bloodshed and persecution in Protestant churches; for a spirit of persecution has prevailed in some of them, but this shall be no more seen in the latter day; Christ's kingdom will be a peaceable kingdom, and of the peace of it there will be no end; as there will be no war in a civil sense, so neither in a religious sense; all animosities, disputes, and contentions, will cease; see <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and much less will there be any effusion of blood on account of religion, nor any that shed it; as the Targum paraphrases the words, <p>"and they that shed innocent blood in Jerusalem shall be removed out of it:'' <p>it is added, <p>by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning; the Targum is, <p>"by the word of judgment, and by the word of consummation or perfection;'' <p>by the former is meant a judicious spirit, which the Lord will give to his churches and ministers; a set of ministers will be raised up, having the everlasting Gospel, which they shall freely, fully, and openly preach unto all men; by which means the churches will be cleared of all false doctrines; clear and distinct light will be given to all the preachers of the word; the watchmen shall see eye to eye; and all Zion's children be taught of God; and this shall be universal all the world over; there will be a discerning of spirits of men and doctrines, whether of God, or not; by which good doctrines will be distinguished from bad ones, and good men from the wicked; and this will be part of the judgment which will be given to the saints of the most High, and will proceed from the Spirit of God; who will be poured out in a plenteous manner to guide the churches into all truth, as it is in Jesus; and by the latter, "the spirit of burning", is meant a burning flaming zeal; a zeal according to knowledge, against all false doctrine and worship, and for the pure doctrine and worship of Christ; which will appear in Christian ministers and churches, and also in Christian magistrates, who will hate the whore, and burn her flesh with fire; and who will be stirred up by the preachers of the Gospel to pour out the plagues on the antichristian states, <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a> and when the fire of God's word will burn up all the wood, hay, and stubble, which the day will declare; and then will be the trying winnowing time, and those that are left will be holy unto the Lord. <p>(n) Or, "for the Lord shall wash away"; so Noldius, in Ebr.

Manasseh did the same (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>): and the practice was probably widespread among the people long before Isaiah's time (see <a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the spirit of burning</span>; or, <span class="accented">by a blast of burning</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fiery blast which shall destroy everything (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jehovah took away all this glory, with which the women of Jerusalem were adorned, they would be turned into wretched-looking prisoners, disfigured by ill-treatment and dirt. - "And instead of balmy scent there will be mouldiness, and instead of the sash a rope, and instead of artistic ringlets a baldness, and instead of the dress-cloak a frock of sackcloth, branding instead of beauty." Mouldiness, or mother (mak, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, the dust of things that have moulded away), with which they would be covered, and which they would be obliged to breathe, would take the place of the bosem, i.e., the scent of the balsam shrub (ba&#770;sa&#770;m), and of sweet-scented pomade in general; and nipa&#770;h that of the beautifully embroidered girdle (<a href="/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>). The meaning of this word is neither "a wound," as the Targums and Talmud render it, nor "rags," as given by Knobel, ed. 1((from na&#770;kaph, percutere, perforare), but the rope thrown over them as prisoners (from ka&#770;pha&#770;h  equals  ka&#770;va&#770;h, Contorquere: lxx, Vulg., Syr.).<p>(Note: Credner (Joel, p. 147) renders the word "tatters," from na&#770;kaph, to rub in pieces; but the word has no such meaning, whereas the meaning vulnus, lit., percussio, is admissible (see at <a href="/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>), but does not suit the antithesis. Luzzatto connects it with n'kaph, to bind (from which the makkeph derives its name), and understands it as referring to the dressing applied to wounds, to lint into which the girdle was torn. The most plausible derivation is from ka&#770;pha&#770;h, which is really employed in post-biblical usage to signify not only to congeal and wrinkle, but also to thicken (Sabbath 21a, l'hakpoth: "Make the wick thicker, that it may burn the brighter"). It is probably radically akin to the Arabic nukbe (explained in Lamachzari as equivalent to the Persian mija&#770;n-bend, a girdle), which is apparently used to denote the coarse girdle worn by peasants or by Arab women of the wandering tribes, resembling a rope of goat's hair, as distinguished from the artistic and costly girdle worn by women of the upper classes in the towns.)<p>Baldness takes the place of artistic ringlets (&#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, not &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, so that it is in apposition: cf., <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; Ges. 113; Ewald, 287, b). The reference is not to golden ornaments for the head, as the Sept. rendering gives it, although miksheh is used elsewhere to signify embossed or carved work in metal or wood; but here we are evidently to understand by the "artificial twists" either curls made with the curling-tongs, or the hair plaited and twisted up in knots, which they would be obliged to cut off in accordance with the mourning customs (<a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>), or which would fall off in consequence of grief. A frock of sackcloth (machagoreth sak), i.e., a smock of coarse haircloth worn next to the skin, such as Layard found depicted upon a bas-relief at Kouyunjik, would take the place of the pethigil, i.e., the dress-cloak (either from pa&#770;thag, to be wide or full, with the substantive termination &#305;&#772;l, or else composed of pethi, breadth, and gil, festive rejoicing); and branding the place of beauty. Branding (Ci  equals  Cevi, from Ca&#770;va&#770;h, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), the mark burnt upon the forehead by their conquerors: Ci is a substantive,<p>(Note: It is so understood in b. Sabbath 62b, with an allusion to the proverb, "The end of beauty is burning" (viz., inflammation). In Arabia, the application of the Cey with a red-hot iron (mikwa&#770;h) plays a very important part in the medical treatment of both man and beast. You meet with many men who have been burned not only on their legs and arms, but in their faces as well, and, as a rule, the finest horses are disfigured by the Cey. - Wetzstein.)<p>not a particle, as the Targum and others render it, and as the makkeph might make it appear. There is something very effective in the inverted order of the words in the last clause of the five. In this five-fold reverse would shame and mourning take the place of proud, voluptuous rejoicing. </body></html>
