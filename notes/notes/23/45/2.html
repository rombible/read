Crœsus, celebrated beyond all the kings of that age for his riches, gave up his treasures to Cyrus, with an exact account, in writing, of the whole, containing the particulars with which each wagon was loaded, when they were carried away: and they were delivered to Cyrus at the palace of Babylon.

The gates of Babylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered.

The idea is, I will take away everything that would retard or oppose your victorious march.<p>And make the crooked paths straight - (See the note at <a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>). The Chaldee renders this, 'My word shall go before thee, and I will prostrate the walls.' Lowth renders it, 'Make the mountains plain.' Noyes, 'Make the high places plain.' The Septuagint renders it, &#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;  Ore&#772; homalio&#772; - 'Level mountains.' Vulgate, Gloriosos terroe humiliabo - 'The high places of the earth I will bring down.' The word &#1492;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  ha&#774;du&#770;r&#305;&#770;ym is from &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;  ha&#770;dar, to be large, ample, swollen, tumid; and probably means the swollen tumid places, that is, the hills or elevated places; and the idea is, that God would make them level, or would remove all obstructions out of his way.<p>I will break in pieces the gates of brass - Ancient cities were surrounded by walls, and secured by strong gates, which were not unfrequently made of brass. To Babylon there were one hundred gates, twenty-five on each side of the city, which, with their posts, were made of brass. 'In the circumference of the walls,' says Herodotus (i. 179), 'at different distances, were a hundred massy gates of brass, whose hinges and frames were of the same metal.' It was to this, doubtless, that the passage before us refers.<p>The bars of iron - With which the gates of the city were fastened. 'One method of securing the gates of fortified places among the ancients, was to cover them with thick plates of iron - a custom which is still used in the East, and seems to be of great antiquity. We learn from Pitts, that Algiers has five gates, and some of these have two, some three other gates within them, and some of them plated all over with iron. Pococke, speaking of a bridge near Antioch, called the iron bridge, says, that there are two towers belonging to it, the gates of which are covered with iron plates. Some of these gates are plated over with brass; such are the enormous gates of the principal mosque at Damascus, formerly the church of John the Baptist' (Paxton). The general idea in these passages is, that Cyrus would owe his success to divine interposition; and that that interposition would be so striking that it would be manifest that he owed his success to the favor of heaven. This was so clear in the history of Cyrus, that it is recognized by himself, and was also recognized even by the pagan who witnessed the success of his arms. Thus Cyrus says <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>, 'Jehovah, God of heaven, hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth.' Thus Herodotus (i. 124) records the fact that Harpagus said in a letter to Cyrus, 'Son of Cambyses, heaven evidently favors you, or you could never have thus risen superior to fortune.' So Herodotus (i. 205) says that Cyrus regarded himself as endowed with powers more than human:, 'When he considered the special circumstances of his birth, he believed himself more than human. He reflected also on the prosperity of his arms, and that wherever he had extended his excursions, he had been followed by success and victory.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. crooked &#8230; straight&#8212;(Isa 40:4), rather, "maketh mountains plain" [Lowth], that is, clear out of thy way all opposing persons and things.

According to Herodotus, the gates of Babylon were of solid bronze, and one hundred in number (1:179).

It is introduced as the word of Jehovah, who first gave existence to Israel, and has not let it go to ruin. "Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb, I Jehovah am He that accomplisheth all; who stretched out the heavens alone, spread out the earth by Himself; who bringeth to nought the signs of the prophets of lies, and exposeth the soothsayers as raging mad; who turneth back the wise men, and maketh their science folly; who realizeth the word of His servant, and accomplisheth the prediction of His messengers; who saith to Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited! and to the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and their ruins I raise up again! who saith to the whirlpool, Dry up; and I dry its streams! who saith to Koresh, My shepherd and he will perform all my will; and will say to Jerusalem, She shall be built, and the temple founded!" The prophecy which commences with <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a> is carried on through this group of vv. in a series of participial predicates to &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; (I) Jehovah is &#8219;o&#772;seh ko&#772;l, accomplishing all (perficiens omnia), so that there is nothing that is not traceable to His might and wisdom as the first cause. It was He who alone, without the co-operation of any other being, stretched out the heavens, who made the earth into a wide plain by Himself, i.e., so that it proceeded from Himself alone: &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as in <a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a> (compare &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; and mimmenn&#305;&#772; in <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>), chethib &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497;, "who was with me," or "who is it beside me?"

"Who brings to nought (me&#772;phe&#772;r, opp. me&#772;q&#305;&#772;m) the signs," i.e., the marvellous proofs of their divine mission which the false prophets adduced by means of fraud and witchcraft.

By "his servant" we are to understand Israel itself, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>, but only relatively, namely, as the bearer of the prophetic word, and therefore as the kernel of Israel regarded from the standpoint of the prophetic mission which it performed; and consequently "his messengers" are the prophets of Jehovah who were called out of Israel. The singular "his servant" is expanded in "his messenger" into the plurality embraced in the one idea. This is far more probable than that the author of these prophetic words, who only speaks of himself in a roundabout manner even in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>, should here refer directly to himself (according to <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a> the predicates become special prophecies, and hence their outward limits are also defined.

In <a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a> the prophecy moves back from the restoration of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah to the conquest of Babylon. The expression calls to mind the drying up of the Red Sea (<a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>); but here it relates to something future, according to <a href="/isaiah/42-15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a> -namely, to the drying up of the Euphrates, which Cyrus turned into the enlarged basin of Sepharvaim, so that the water sank to the depth of a single foot, and men could "go through on foot" (Herod. i. 191). But in the complex view of the prophet, the possibility of the conqueror's crossing involved the possibility or the exiles' departing from the prison of the imperial city, which was surrounded by a natural and artificial line of waters (<a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, to whiz or whirl) refers to the Euphrates, just as metsu&#772;la&#770;h in <a href="/job/41-23.htm">Job 41:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a>, does to the Nile; &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is used in the same sense as the Homeric &#787;&#x3a9;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;.

The deliverer of Israel is mentioned by name: "That saith to Koresh, My shepherd (i.e., a &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; appointed by me), and he who performs all my will" (che&#772;phets, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, not in the generalized sense of &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), and that inasmuch as he (Cyrus) saith to (or of) Jerusalem, It shall be built (tibba&#770;neh, not the second pers. tibba&#770;n&#305;&#772;), and the foundation of the temple laid (he&#772;kha&#770;l a masculine elsewhere, here a feminine). This is the passage which is said by Josephus to have induced Cyrus to send back the Jews to their native land: "Accordingly, when Cyrus read this, and admired the divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfil what was so written" (Jos. Ant. xi. 2). According to Ctesias and others, the name of Cyrus signifies the sun.But all that can really be affirmed is, that it sounds like the name of the sun. For in Neo-Pers. the sun is called char, in Zendic hvare&#774; (kare&#774;), and from this proper names are formed, such as chars'&#305;&#770;d (Sunshine, also the Sun); but Cyrus is called Kuru or Khuru upon the monuments, and this cannot possibly be connected with our chur, which would be uwara in Old Persian (Rawlinson, Lassen, Spiegel), and Ko&#772;resh is simply the name of Kuru (&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;-&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) Hebraized after the manner of a segholate. There is a marble-block, for example, in the Murghab valley, not far from the mausoleum of Cyrus, which contained the golden coffin with the body of the king (see Strabo, xv 3, 7); and on this we find an inscription that we also meet with elsewhere, viz., adam. k'ur'us.khsa&#770;ya  thiya.hakha&#770;manisiya, i.e., I am Kuru the king of the Achaemenides.<p>(Note: See the engraving of this tomb of Cyrus, which is now called the "Tomb of Solomon's mother," in Vaux's Nineveh and Persepolis (p. 345). On the identity of Murghb and Pasargadae, see Spiegel, Keil-inschriften, pp. 71, 72; and with regard to the discovery of inscriptions that may still be expected around the tomb of Cyrus, the Journal of the Asiatic Society, x. 46, note 4 (also compare Spiegel's Geschichte der Entzifferung der Keil-schrift, im "Ausland," 1865, p. 413).)<p>This name is identical with the name of the river Kur (&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;-&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); and what Strabo says is worthy of notice - namely, that "there is also a river called Cyrus, which flows through the so-called cave of Persis near Pasargadae, and whence the king took his name, changing it from Agradates into Cyrus" (Strab. xv 3, 6). It is possible also that there may be some connection between the name and the Indian princely title of Kuru.  </body></html>
