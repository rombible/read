Many interpreters, however, prefer rendering the words interrogatively, thus: <span class="ital">Do you, </span>or <span class="ital">will you, ask, </span>or <span class="ital">question me, of things to come concerning my sons? and concerning the work of my hands will you command me? </span>As if he had said, Will you not allow me the liberty which yourselves take, of disposing of my own children and works as I see fit?

Such an exact prediction of events, which depended on the mind and will of Cyrus, is mentioned here as an infallible evidence of the certainty of God’s foreknowledge, and of his being the only true God, because idols could discover no such things.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>45:11-19 Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if for their good, it will not be withheld. But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord - This verse is designed still further to illustrate the general subject referred to in this chapter, and especially to show them, that instead of complaining of his designs, or of finding fault with his sovereignty, it was their privilege to inquire respecting his dealings, and even to 'command' him. He was willing to be inquired of, and to instruct them in regard to the events which were occurring.<p>And his Maker - (See the note at <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>Ask me of things to come - I alone can direct and order future events; and it is your duty and privilege to make inquiry respecting those events. Lowth renders this as a question, 'Do ye question me concerning my children?' But the more correct rendering is doubtless that in our translations, where it is represented as a duty to make inquiry respecting future events from God. The idea is:<p>1. That God alone could direct future events, and give information respecting them.<p>2. That instead of complaining of his allotments, they should humbly inquire of him in regard to their design, and the proper manner of meeting them; and<p>3. That if they were made the subject of humble, fervent, believing prayer, he would order them so as to promote their welfare, and would furnish them grace to meet them in a proper manner.<p>Concerning my sons - Those who are my adopted children. It is implied that God loved them as his children, and that they had the privilege of pleading for his favor and regard, with the assurance that he would be propitious to their cry, and would order events so as to promote their welfare.<p>And concerning the work of my hands - In regard to what I do. This is also read as a question by Lowth; 'And do ye give me directions concerning the work of my hands?' According to this interpretation, God would reprove them for presuming to give him direction about what he should do, in accordance with the sentiment in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9-10</a>. This interpretation also is adopted by Vitringa, Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and some others. Grotius renders it, 'Hinder, if you can, my doing what I will with them. Thus you will show what you can do, and what I can do.' Rosenmuller supposes it to mean, 'Commit my sons, and the work of my hands to me: suffer me to do with my own what I will.' It seems to me, however, that the word 'command'is here to be taken rather as indicating the privilege of his people to present their desires in the language of fervent and respectful petition; and that God here indicates that he would, so to speak, allow them to direct him; that he would hear their prayers, and would conform the events of his administration to their wishes and their welfare. This is the most obvious interpretation; and this will perhaps suit the connection as well as any other. Instead of complaining, and opposing his administration <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9-10</a>, it was their privilege to come before him and spread out their needs, and even to give direction in regard to future events, so far as the events of his administration would bear on them, and he would meet their desires. Thus interpreted, it accords with the numerous passages of the Bible which command us to pray; and with the promises of God that he will lend a listening ear to our cries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Ask &#8230; command&#8212;Instead of striving with Me in regard to My purposes, your wisdom is in prayer to ask, and even command Me, in so far as it is for My glory, and for your real good (Mr 11:24; Joh 16:23, 13, latter part of the verse; 1Jo 3:22).<p>sons&#8212;(Isa 54:13; Ga 3:26).<p>work of my hands&#8212;spiritually (Eph 2:10); also literal Israel (Isa 60:21). Maurer translates, instead of "command," Leave it to Me, in My dealings concerning My sons and concerning the work of My hands, to do what I will with My own. Lowth reads it interrogatively, Do ye presume to question Me and dictate to Me (see Isa 45:9, 10)? The same sense is given, if the words be taken in irony.

Will you set bounds to me by your commands, that I shall do this, and not that, according to your good pleasure? This is intolerable boldness in you; and yet I am able to give a good account of my actions. And the account is given in the following verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,.... He whose name alone is Jehovah, who is glorious in holiness, the Sanctifier of his people, and the Maker of them, both as creatures, and new creatures: <p>ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me; these words are not spoken to idolaters, or the idolatrous Jews, or those of them that were inclined to idolatry; directing them to ask of the Lord, and not of their idols, things to come, which they were not able to show, and to seek to him for, and insist upon the performance of his promises to them, his children, and creatures; but to the spiritual Israel of God, as the preface shows, directing them to inquire after things future, concerning his children and people, especially among the Gentiles, whom the carnal Jews despised; and to expect, and believe, and even as it were demand the performance of them, being promised and prophesied of: there are some who are the "sons" of God, not by creation only, or by natural birth, or by desert, or merely by profession, but by adopting grace; which is a very great and excellent privilege, preferable to civil or national adoption, or to the highest rank of sonship among men; a blessing which continues forever, and entitles to eternal life: and these become the work of the Lord's hands in regeneration; they are made new creatures; they are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus; whatever is wrought in them is of his operation, faith, hope, love, and every grace, which make up that good work which shall be performed until the day of Christ: first, men are the sons of God by adoption, and then they are his workmanship in regeneration; and the latter because of the former, and of which the latter is an evidence: now there were and are "things to come", concerning these persons; there were some things to come, and which were to come to pass, and did, in the first times of the Gospel, as the incarnation of Christ, and redemption by him; his sufferings and death, and the glory that should follow; the effusion of Spirit, and the conversion of the Gentiles; all which were for the sake of these "sons" of God, and respected them: and there are other things yet to come concerning them, and will be accomplished in the latter day; some things sad and sorrowful, as the giving the outward court to the Gentiles, the Protestant churches to the Papists, and the slaying of the witnesses; and others desirable and joyful, as the numerous conversions of the Jews and Gentiles; their extensive knowledge of spiritual things, and their abundant peace and prosperity; the increase of brotherly love, their purity, spirituality, holiness, and righteousness; their power, authority, and dominion, both in the spiritual and personal reign of Christ, and their ultimate glory. And now the Lord allows his people, and encourages them to "ask" of him these things; to inquire of him by prayer, and by searching the Scriptures, what these things are that are to come; what of them have been accomplished, and what of them remain to be accomplished, "and how long it will be to the end of these wonders", <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a>, and so Jarchi interprets the word, rendered "things to come in the text", signs and wonders: and they may and should pray for the accomplishment of them; yea, insist upon and demand them. The Lord not only allows his people to put him in remembrance of his promises and prophecies, but to plead for, and, as it were, require the performance of them; and so the words are an encouragement to the importunate prayer of faith. Faith in prayer has great power with God, a kind of command over him; it holds him to his word; it will not let him go without the blessing; nor let him alone till he has made good his promise; nor give him any rest, day nor night, till he has fulfilled the things to come concerning his sons. Some (r) read the words by way of interrogation, "do ye ask or question me concerning things to come?" what I intend to do hereafter? am I obliged to give you an account of my secret purposes and designs? or make you acquainted with future events? "do ye, or should ye, command me concerning, my sons and the works of my hands?" will you prescribe to me what I shall do in my family? am I a father, and must I be directed what to do with my sons? am I the Maker of all men, and must I be told what to do with the work of my hands? what arrogance and insolence is this! but the former reading and sense are best. <p>(r) So Gataker, and some in the Dutch annotations, and Vitringa. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</span><p>(n) Instead of murmuring, humble yourselves and ask what you will for the consolation of my children, and you will be sure of it as you are of these things which are at your command.

If the text be quite accurate, <span class="ital">ask me</span> must mean “ask me, but do not criticise me,” and <span class="ital">command me</span> must mean “leave to my care” (as <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm" title="But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-30.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;">1 Samuel 25:30</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-21.htm" title="And David said to Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.">2 Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm" title="And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that he will make you an house.">2 Samuel 7:11</a>). But Cheyne well observes that these parallels are not exact, the verb being used of a charge laid on an inferior by a superior; and it is doubtful if it could be suitably employed of committing anything to the charge of God. He supposes that by an easily explicable omission of a consonant an imperf. has been changed into an imper.; and his translation is perhaps more forcible than any that can be obtained from the received text: <span class="bld">concerning things to come</span> (<a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm" title="Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.">Isaiah 41:23</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-7.htm" title="And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show to them.">Isaiah 44:7</a>) <span class="bld">will ye question</span> (i.e. “interrogate” in a hostile sense) <span class="bld">me? and concerning … the work of my hands will ye lay commands upon me</span>?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">concerning my sons</span>] should (according to the accents) be taken with what follows (as R.V.); but the phrase is irrelevant and should probably be omitted as a gloss based on <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/45-10.htm" title="Woe to him that said to his father, What beget you? or to the woman, What have you brought forth?">Isaiah 45:10</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Holy One of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who always does right, and with whom, therefore, it is absurd to find fault. <span class="cmt_word">His Maker</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel's Maker, who has, therefore, the right to do with him as he pleases. <span class="cmt_word">Ask me of things to come concerning my sons</span>.

"For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I called thee hither by name, surnamed thee when thou knewest me not. I Jehovah, and there is none else, beside me no God: I equipped thee when thou knewest me not; that they may know from the rising of the sun, and its going down, that there is none without me: I Jehovah, and there is none else, former of the light, and creator of the darkness; founder of peace, and creator of evil: I Jehovah am He who worketh all this." The &#1493;&#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; which follows the second reason assigned like an apodosis, is construed doubly: "I called to thee, calling thee by name." The parallel &#1488;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1498; refers to such titles of honour as "my shepherd" and "my anointed," which had been given to him by Jehovah. This calling, distinguishing, and girding, i.e., this equipment of Cyrus, took place at a time when Cyrus knew nothing as yet of Jehovah, and by this very fact Jehovah made known His sole Deity. The meaning is, not that it occurred while he was still worshipping false gods, but, as the refrain-like repetition of the words "though thou hast not know me" affirms with strong emphasis, before he had been brought into existence, or could know anything of Jehovah. The passage is to be explained in the same way as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, "Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee" (see Psychol. pp. 36, 37, 39); and what the God of prophecy here claims for Himself, must not be questioned by false criticism, or weakened down by false apologetics (i.e., by giving up the proper name Cyrus as a gloss in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>; or generalizing it into a king's name, such as Pharaoh, Abimelech, or Agag). The third and last object of this predicted and realized success of the oppressor of nations and deliverer of Israel is the acknowledgement of Jehovah, spreading over the heathen world from the rising and setting of the sun, i.e., in every direction. The ah of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is not a feminine termination (lxx, Targ., Jer.), but a feminine suffix with He raphato pro mappic (Kimchi); compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-17.htm">Isaiah 34:17</a> (but not &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>, or &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a>). Shemesh (the sun) is a feminine here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>, and always in Arabic; for the west is invariably called &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (Arab. magrib). In <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a> we are led by the context to understand by darkness and evil the penal judgments, through which light and peace, or salvation, break forth for the people of God and the nations generally. But as the prophecy concerning Cyrus closes with this self-assertion of Jehovah, it is unquestionably a natural supposition that there is also a contrast implied to the dualistic system of Zarathustra, which divided the one nature of the Deity into two opposing powers (see Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, p. 135). The declaration is so bold, that Marcion appealed to this passage as a proof that the God of the Old Testament was a different being from the God of the New, and not the God of goodness only. The Valentinians and other gnostics also regarded the words "There is no God beside me" in Isaiah, as deceptive words of the Demiurugs. The early church met them with Tertullian's reply, "de his creator profitetur malis quae congruunt judici," and also made use of this self-attestation of the God of revelation as a weapon with which to attack Manicheesism. The meaning of the words is not exhausted by those who content themselves with the assertion, that by the evil (or darkness) we are not to understand the evil of guilt (malum culpae), but the evil of punishment (malum paenae). Undoubtedly, evil as an act is not the direct working of God, but the spontaneous work of a creature endowed with freedom. At the same time, evil, as well as good, has in this sense its origin in God - that He combines within Himself the first principles of love and wrath, the possibility of evil, the self-punishment of evil, and therefore the consciousness of guilt as well as the evil of punishment in the broadest sense. When the apostle celebrates the glory of free grace in <a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a>., he stands on that giddy height, to which few are able to follow him without falling headlong into the false conclusions of a decretum absolutum, and the denial of all creaturely freedom. </body></html>
