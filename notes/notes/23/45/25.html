The entire passage here, I suppose, has reference to the times of the Redeemer (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21-24</a>). If so, it means that justification can be obtained only by the mercy of God through a Redeemer. The great truth is, therefore, here brought into view, which constitutes the sum of the New Testament, that people are not justified by their own works, but by the mercy and grace of God.<p>All the seed of Israel - All the spiritual seed or descendants of Jacob. It cannot mean that every individual shall be justified and saved, for the Bible abundantly teaches the contrary (see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>) But it must mean that all who have a character resembling that of Israel, or Jacob; all who are the true children and friends of God (see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9-13</a>).<p>Be justified - Be regarded and treated as righteous. Their sins shall be pardoned, and they shall be acknowledged and treated as the children of God (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-25</a>). To justify, here, is not to pronounce them innocent, or to regard them as deserving of his favor; but it is to receive them into favor, and to resolve to treat them as if they had not sinned; that is, to treat them as if they were righteous. All this is by the mere mercy and grace of God, and is through the merits of thc Redeemer, who died in their place.<p>And shall glory - Or rather, shall praise and celebrate his goodness. The word used here (&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;  cha&#770;lal) means, in the Piel, "to sing, to chant, to celebrate the praises of anyone" <a href="/1_chronicles/16-36.htm">1 Chronicles 16:36</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a>, and is the word of which the word "hallelujah" is in part composed. Here it means, that the effect of their being justified by Yahweh would be, that they would be filled with joy, and would celebrate the goodness of God. This effect of being justified, is more fully stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>. It is a result which always follows; and a disposition to praise and magnify the name of God in view of his boundless mercy in providing a way by which sinners may be justified, is one of the first promptings of a renewed heart, and one of the evidences that a soul is born again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. all &#8230; Israel&#8212;the spiritual Israel (Ro 2:29) and the literal Israel, that is, the final remnant which shall all be saved (Isa 45:17; Ro 11:26).<p>justified&#8212;treated as if they were just, through Christ's righteousness and death (Jer 23:5).<p>glory&#8212;literally, "sing" in His praise (Jer 9:24; 1Co 1:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the seed of Israel; </span> all Israelites indeed, whether Jews or Gentiles; all believers, who are frequently called God’s Israel in Scripture, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/24-6.htm" title="This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek your face, O Jacob.

By the fulfilment of the promise thus openly proclaimed, those of the heathen who have been saved from the judgment will recognise Jehovah as the only God; and the irresistible will of Jehovah, that all mankind should worship Him, be carried out. The promise cannot remain unfulfilled. "For thus saith Jehovah, the creator of the heavens (He is the Deity), the former of the earth, and its finisher; He has established it (He has not created it a desert, He has formed it to be inhabited): I am Jehovah, and there is none else. I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Into the desert seek ye me! I Jehovah am speaking righteousness, proclaiming upright things." The athnach properly divides <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a> in half. <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a> describes the speaker, and what He says commences in <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>. The first parenthesis affirms that Jehovah is God in the fullest and most exclusive sense; the second that He has created the earth for man's sake, not "as a desert" (to&#772;hu&#772;: the lxx, Targum, and Jerome render this with less accuracy, non in vanum), i.e., not to be and continue to be a desert, but to be inhabited. Even in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, chaos is not described as of God's creation, because (whatever may be men's opinions concerning it in other respects) the creative activity of God merely made use of this as a starting-point, and because, although it did not come into existence without God, it was at any rate not desired by God for its own sake. The words of Jehovah commence, then, with the assertion that Jehovah is the absolute One; and from this two thoughts branch off: (1.) The first is, that the prophecy which emanates from Him is an affair of light, no black art, but essentially different from heathen soothsaying. By "a dark place of the earth" we are to understand, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>, the interior of the earth, and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>, Hades; the intention being to point out the contrast between the prophecies of Jehovah and the heathen cave-oracles and spirit-voices of the necromancists, which seemed to rise up from the interior of the earth (see <a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). (2.) The second thought is, that the very same love of Jehovah, which has already been displayed in the creation, attests itself in His relation to Israel, which He has not directed to Himself "into the desert" (to&#772;hu&#772;), just as He did not create the earth a to&#772;hu&#772;. Meier and Knobel suppose that baqshu&#772;n&#305;&#772;, which is written here, according to a well-supported reading, with Koph raphatum (whereas in other cases the dagesh is generally retained, particularly in the imperative of biqqe&#772;sh), refers to seeking for disclosures as to the future; but the word &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; would be used for this, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>. He has not said, "Seek ye me (as in <a href="/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>) into the desert," i.e., without the prospect of meeting with any return for your pains. On the contrary, He has attached promises to the seeking of Himself, which cannot remain unfulfilled, for He is "one speaking righteousness, declaring things that are right;" i.e., when He promises, He follows out the rule of His purpose and of His plan of salvation, and the impulse of sincere desire for their good, and love which is ever true to itself. The present word of prophecy points to the fulfilment of these promises. </body></html>
