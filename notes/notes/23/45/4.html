The gates of Babylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered.

The statement here is, that God had raised up Cyrus on account of his own people. The sentiment is common in the Bible, that kings and nations are in the hand of God; and that he overrules and directs their actions for the accomplishment of his own purposes, and especially to protect, defend, and deliver his people (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>).<p>I have surnamed thee - On the meaning of the word 'surname,' see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>.

The remainder of the section announces Jehovah’s purpose in raising up Cyrus, which is twofold: (1) the liberation and exaltation of His Servant Israel (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm" title="For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.">Isaiah 45:4</a></span>), and (2) that His Godhead may be acknowledged throughout the world (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm" title="That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:6</a></span>). These two motives are inseparable, since it is only through Israel that the character of Jehovah can be made known to the nations. Hence great as the mission of Cyrus is, he is still but the instrument, while Israel is the goal of the Divine activity (Duhm).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have surnamed thee</span>] i.e. bestowed on thee such honourable appellations as “My Shepherd,” “My Anointed.” See on ch. <a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm" title="One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand to the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.">Isaiah 44:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">though thou hast not known me</span>] Delitzsch and others somewhat strangely take this to mean “before thou hadst being.” But the words present no difficulty in their natural sense, which is that Cyrus entered on his career of conquest ignorant of the true God who made his way prosperous.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Jacob my servant's sake</span>. This second motive is, in a certain sense, the main one. Cyrus is raised up, especially, to perform God's pleasure with respect to Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a>). Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it  may be "a light to lighten the Gentiles;" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end. Its welfare is an end in itself, and would be sought by God apart from any further consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Israel mine elect</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have surnamed thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "given thee designations of honour," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "my anointed" (ver. 1); "my shepherd" (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); "he who shall do all my pleasure" (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Though thou hast not known me; rather, <span class="accented">though thou didst not know me.</span> Cyrus's honours, his titles, his mention by name, etc., were accumulated upon him before his birth, when he knew nothing of God, when, therefore, he had in no way merited them. Thus all was done, not for his sake, but lot the sake of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise takes a new turn here, acquiring greater and greater speciality. It is introduced as the word of Jehovah, who first gave existence to Israel, and has not let it go to ruin. "Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb, I Jehovah am He that accomplisheth all; who stretched out the heavens alone, spread out the earth by Himself; who bringeth to nought the signs of the prophets of lies, and exposeth the soothsayers as raging mad; who turneth back the wise men, and maketh their science folly; who realizeth the word of His servant, and accomplisheth the prediction of His messengers; who saith to Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited! and to the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and their ruins I raise up again! who saith to the whirlpool, Dry up; and I dry its streams! who saith to Koresh, My shepherd and he will perform all my will; and will say to Jerusalem, She shall be built, and the temple founded!" The prophecy which commences with <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a> is carried on through this group of vv. in a series of participial predicates to &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; (I) Jehovah is &#8219;o&#772;seh ko&#772;l, accomplishing all (perficiens omnia), so that there is nothing that is not traceable to His might and wisdom as the first cause. It was He who alone, without the co-operation of any other being, stretched out the heavens, who made the earth into a wide plain by Himself, i.e., so that it proceeded from Himself alone: &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as in <a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a> (compare &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; and mimmenn&#305;&#772; in <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>), chethib &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497;, "who was with me," or "who is it beside me?" The Targum follows the keri; the Septuagint the chethib, attaching it to the following words, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a> passes on from Him whom creation proves to be God, to Him who is proving Himself to be so in history also, and that with obvious reference to the Chaldean soothsayers and wise men (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9-10</a>), who held out to proud Babylon the most splendid and hopeful prognostics. "Who brings to nought (me&#772;phe&#772;r, opp. me&#772;q&#305;&#772;m) the signs," i.e., the marvellous proofs of their divine mission which the false prophets adduced by means of fraud and witchcraft. The lxx render badd&#305;&#772;m, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Targ. b&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;n (in other passages  equals  'o&#772;b, <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; 'o&#772;bo&#772;th, <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; hence  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;). At <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a> and <a href="/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a> we have derived it as a common noun from &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1488;, to speak at random; but it is possible that &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; may originally have signified to produce or bring forth, without any reference to &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, then to invent, to fabricate, so that badd&#305;&#772;m as a personal name (as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-36.htm">Jeremiah 50:36</a>) would be synonymous with badda&#770;'&#305;&#772;m, mendaces. On qo&#772;sem&#305;&#772;m, see <a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a>; on yeho&#772;le&#772;l, (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm">Job 12:17</a>, where it occurs in connection with a similar predicative description of God according to His works. <p>In <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a> a contrast is draw between the heathen soothsayers and wise men, and the servant and messengers of Jehovah, whose word, whose &#8219;e&#772;tsa&#770;h, i.e., determination or disclosure concerning the future (cf., ya&#770;&#8219;ats, <a href="/isaiah/41-28.htm">Isaiah 41:28</a>), he realizes and perfectly fulfils. By "his servant" we are to understand Israel itself, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>, but only relatively, namely, as the bearer of the prophetic word, and therefore as the kernel of Israel regarded from the standpoint of the prophetic mission which it performed; and consequently "his messengers" are the prophets of Jehovah who were called out of Israel. The singular "his servant" is expanded in "his messenger" into the plurality embraced in the one idea. This is far more probable than that the author of these prophetic words, who only speaks of himself in a roundabout manner even in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>, should here refer directly to himself (according to <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a> the predicates become special prophecies, and hence their outward limits are also defined. As we have &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, we must adopt the rendering habitetur and oedificentur, with which the continuation of the latter et vastata ejus erigam agrees. In <a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a> the prophecy moves back from the restoration of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah to the conquest of Babylon. The expression calls to mind the drying up of the Red Sea (<a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>); but here it relates to something future, according to <a href="/isaiah/42-15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a> -namely, to the drying up of the Euphrates, which Cyrus turned into the enlarged basin of Sepharvaim, so that the water sank to the depth of a single foot, and men could "go through on foot" (Herod. i. 191). But in the complex view of the prophet, the possibility of the conqueror's crossing involved the possibility or the exiles' departing from the prison of the imperial city, which was surrounded by a natural and artificial line of waters (<a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, to whiz or whirl) refers to the Euphrates, just as metsu&#772;la&#770;h in <a href="/job/41-23.htm">Job 41:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a>, does to the Nile; &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is used in the same sense as the Homeric &#787;&#x3a9;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;. In <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> the special character of the promise reaches its highest shoot. The deliverer of Israel is mentioned by name: "That saith to Koresh, My shepherd (i.e., a &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; appointed by me), and he who performs all my will" (che&#772;phets, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, not in the generalized sense of &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), and that inasmuch as he (Cyrus) saith to (or of) Jerusalem, It shall be built (tibba&#770;neh, not the second pers. tibba&#770;n&#305;&#772;), and the foundation of the temple laid (he&#772;kha&#770;l a masculine elsewhere, here a feminine). This is the passage which is said by Josephus to have induced Cyrus to send back the Jews to their native land: "Accordingly, when Cyrus read this, and admired the divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfil what was so written" (Jos. Ant. xi. 2). According to Ctesias and others, the name of Cyrus signifies the sun.But all that can really be affirmed is, that it sounds like the name of the sun. For in Neo-Pers. the sun is called char, in Zendic hvare&#774; (kare&#774;), and from this proper names are formed, such as chars'&#305;&#770;d (Sunshine, also the Sun); but Cyrus is called Kuru or Khuru upon the monuments, and this cannot possibly be connected with our chur, which would be uwara in Old Persian (Rawlinson, Lassen, Spiegel), and Ko&#772;resh is simply the name of Kuru (&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;-&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) Hebraized after the manner of a segholate. There is a marble-block, for example, in the Murghab valley, not far from the mausoleum of Cyrus, which contained the golden coffin with the body of the king (see Strabo, xv 3, 7); and on this we find an inscription that we also meet with elsewhere, viz., adam. k'ur'us.khsa&#770;ya  thiya.hakha&#770;manisiya, i.e., I am Kuru the king of the Achaemenides.<p>(Note: See the engraving of this tomb of Cyrus, which is now called the "Tomb of Solomon's mother," in Vaux's Nineveh and Persepolis (p. 345). On the identity of Murghb and Pasargadae, see Spiegel, Keil-inschriften, pp. 71, 72; and with regard to the discovery of inscriptions that may still be expected around the tomb of Cyrus, the Journal of the Asiatic Society, x. 46, note 4 (also compare Spiegel's Geschichte der Entzifferung der Keil-schrift, im "Ausland," 1865, p. 413).)<p>This name is identical with the name of the river Kur (&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;-&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); and what Strabo says is worthy of notice - namely, that "there is also a river called Cyrus, which flows through the so-called cave of Persis near Pasargadae, and whence the king took his name, changing it from Agradates into Cyrus" (Strab. xv 3, 6). It is possible also that there may be some connection between the name and the Indian princely title of Kuru.  </body></html>
