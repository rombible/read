He adores the depth of the divine counsels which, by devious ways and after long ages, have led to this bright result. And as he thinks of all the long-stretching preparations, all the apparently hostile forces which have been truly subsidiary, all the generations during which these Egyptian and Ethiopian tribes have been the enemies and oppressors of that Israel whom they at last acknowledge for the dwelling-place of God, and enemies of that Jehovah before whom they finally bow down, he feels that he has no measuring-line to fathom the divine purposes, and bows his face to the ground in reverent contemplation with that word upon his lips: ‘Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.’ It is a parallel to the apostolic words, ‘O the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But such thoughts are but a half truth, and may very easily become in men’s minds a whole error, and therefore they are followed by a marvellous section in which the Lord Himself speaks, and of which the whole burden is-the clearness and fulness with which God makes Himself known to men. True it is that there are depths inaccessible in the divine nature. True it is that there are mysteries unrevealed in the method of the divine procedure, and especially in that of the relation of heathen tribes to His gospel and His love. True it is that there are mysteries opened in the very word of His grace. But notwithstanding all this-it is also true that He makes Himself known to us all, that He declares righteousness, that He calls us to seek Him, and that He wills to be found and known by us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The collocation of these two passages may be taken, then, as representing the two phases of the Divine Manifestation, the obscurity which must ever be associated with all our finite knowledge of God, and the clear sunlight in which blazes all that we need to know of Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. After all revelation, God is hidden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>There is revelation of His Name in all His works. His action must be all self-manifestation. But after all it is obscure and hidden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Nature hides while it reveals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nature’s revelation is unobtrusive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God is concealed behind second causes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God is concealed behind regular modes of working {laws}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nature’s revelation is partial, disclosing only a fragment of the name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nature’s revelation is ambiguous. Dark shadows of death and pain in the sensitive world, of ruin and convulsions, of shivered stars, seem to contradict the faith that all is very good; so that it has been possible for men to drop their plummet in the deep and say, ‘I find no God,’ and for others to fall into Manichaeism or some form or other of dualism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Providence hides while it reveals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That is the sphere in which men are most familiar with the idea of mystery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is much of which we do not see the issue. The process is not completed, and so the end is not visible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Even when we believe that ‘to Him’ and ‘for good’ are ‘all things,’ we cannot tell how all will come circling round. We are like men looking only at one small segment of an ellipse which is very eccentric.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is much of which we do not see the consistency with the divine character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We are confronted with stumbling-blocks in the allotment of earthly conditions; in the long ages and many tribes which are without knowledge of God; in the sore sorrows, national and individual.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We can array a formidable host. But it is to be remembered that revelation actually increases these. It is just because we know so much of God that we feel them so keenly. I suppose the mysteries of the divine government trouble others outside the sphere of revelation but little. The darkness is made visible by the light.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Even in ‘grace’ God is hidden while revealed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Infinite and Eternal cannot be grasped by man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The conception of infinity and eternity is given us by revelation, but it is not comprehended so that its contents are fully known. The words are known, but their full meaning is not, and no revelation can make them, known to finite intelligences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God dwells in light inaccessible, which is darkness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Revelation opens abysses down which we cannot look. It raises and leaves unsettled as many questions as it solves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The telescope resolves many nebulae, but only to bring more unresolvable ones into the field of vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now all this is but one side of the truth. There is a tendency in some minds to underrate what is plain because all is not plain. For some minds the obscure has a fascination, apart altogether from its nature, just because it is obscure. It is a noble emulation to press forward and ‘still to be closing up what we know not with what we know.’ But neither in science nor in religion shall we make progress if we do not take heed of the opposing errors of thinking that all is seen, and of thinking that what we have is valueless because there are gaps in it. The constellations are none the less bright nor immortal fires, though there be waste places in heaven where nothing but opaque blackness is seen. In these days it is especially needful to insist both on the incompleteness of all our religious knowledge, and to say that-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Notwithstanding all obscurity, God has amply revealed Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Though God hides Himself, still there comes from heaven the voice-’I have not spoken in secret,’ Now these words contain these thoughts-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That whatever darkness there may be, there is none due to the manner of the revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God has not spoken in secret, in a corner. There are no arbitrary difficulties made or unnecessary darkness left in His revelation. <span class="ital">We</span> have no right to say that He has left difficulties to test our faith. <span class="ital">He</span> Himself has never said so. He deals with us in good faith, doing all that can be done to enlighten, regard being had to still loftier considerations, to the freedom of the human will, to the laws which He has Himself imposed on our nature, and the purposes for which we are here. It is very important to grasp this. We have been told as much as <span class="ital">can</span> be told. Contrast with such a revelation the cave-muttered oracles of heathenism and their paltering double sense. Be sure that when God speaks, He speaks clearly and to all, and that in Christianity there is no esoteric teaching for a few initiated only, while the multitude are put off with shows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That whatever obscurity there may be, there is none which hides the divine invitation or Him from those who obey it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘I have never said . . . seek ye Me in vain.’ Much is obscure if speculative completeness is looked for, but the moral relations of God and man are not obscure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All which the heart needs is made known. His revelation is clearly His seeking us, and His revelation is His gracious call to us to seek Him. He is ever found by those who seek. They have not to press through obscurities to find Him, but the desire to possess must precede possession in spiritual matters. He is no hidden God, lurking in obscurity and only to be found by painful search. They who ‘seek’ Him know where to find Him, and seek because they know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That whatever may be obscure, the Revelation of righteousness is clear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have to face speculative difficulties in plenty, but the great fact remains that in Revelation steady light is focussed on the moral qualities of the divine Nature and especially on His righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And the revelation of the divine righteousness reaches its greatest brightness, as that of all the divine Nature does, in the Person and work of Jesus. Very significantly the idea of God’s righteousness is fully developed in the immediately subsequent context. There we find that attribute linked in close and harmonious conjunction with what shallower thought is apt to regard as being in antagonism to it. He declares Himself to be ‘a just {righteous} God and a Saviour.’ So then, if we would rightly conceive of His righteousness, we must give it a wider extension than that of retributive justice or cold, inflexible aloofness from sinners. It impels God to be man’s saviour. And with similar enlarging of popular conceptions there follows: ‘In the Lord is righteousness and strength,’ and therefore, ‘In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified {declared and made righteous} and shall glory’-then, the divine Righteousness is communicative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All these thoughts, germinal in the prophet’s words, are set in fullest light, and certified by the most heart-moving facts, in the Person and work of Jesus Christ. He ‘declares at this time His righteousness, that He might Himself be righteous and the maker righteous of them that have faith in Jesus.’ Whatever is dark, this is clear, that ‘Jehovah our Righteousness’ has come to us in His Son, in whom seeking Him we shall never seek in vain, but ‘be found in Him, not having a righteousness of our own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If the great purpose of revelation is to make us know that God loves us, and has given us His Son that in Him we may know Him and possess His Righteousness, difficulties and obscurities in its form or in its substance take a very different aspect. What need we more than that knowledge and possession? Be not robbed of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Many things are not written in the book of the divine Revelation, whether it be that of Nature, of human history, or of our own spirits, or even of the Gospel, but these are written that we may believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and believing, may have life in His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/45.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm" title="I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek you me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.">Isaiah 45:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place, </span>&c. — This is declared in opposition to the manner in which the heathen oracles gave their answers; which were generally delivered not only darkly and doubtfully, but from obscure cells and caverns of the earth: such was the seat of the Cumean Sibyl:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Excisum Euboicæ latus ingens rupis in antrum.” <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“A spacious cave within its farmost part Was hew’d, and fashion’d by laborious art:</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Through the hill’s hollow sides —” VIRG.

But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations.

He did not imitate the pagan oracles by uttering his predictions from dark and deep caverns, and encompassed with the circumstances of awful mystery, and with designed obscurity.<p>In a dark place of the earth - From a cave, or dark recess, in the manner of the pagan oracles. The pagan responses were usually given from some dark cavern or recess, doubtless the bettcr to impress with awe the minds of those who consulted the oracles, and to make them more ready to credit the revelations of the fancied god. Such was the seat of the Sybil, mentioned by Virgil, AEn. vi. 4:<p>Excisum Euhoicae latus ingens rupis in antrum<p>Such also was the famous oracle at Delphi. Strobe (ix.) says, 'The oracle is said to be a hollow cavern of considerable depth, with an opening not very wide.' Diodorus, giving an account of this oracle, says, 'that there was in that place a great chasm, or cleft in the earth; in which very place is now situated what is called the Adytum of the temple.' In contradistinction from all this, God says that he had spoken openly, and without these circumstances of designed obscurity and darkness. In the language here, there is a remarkable resemblance to what the Saviour said of himself, and it is not improbable that he had this passage in his mind: 'I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing' <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>. A similar declaration occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11</a> : 'This commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.'<p>I said not to the seed of Jacob - The seed, or the race of Jacob, here means his people: and the idea is, that he had not commanded them to call upon him without his being ready to answer them.<p>Seek ye me in vain - The phrase, 'seek ye,' may refer to worship in general; or more properly to their calling upon him in times of calamity and trial. The sense is, that it had not been a vain or useless thing for them to serve him; that he had been their protector, and their friend; and that they had not gone to him, and spread out their needs for nothing. It is still true, that God does not command his people to seek him in vain (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>). His service is always attended with a rich blessing to them; and they are his witnesses that he confers on them inexpressibly great and valuable rewards. It follows from this - first, that his people have abundant encouragement to go to him in all times of trial, persecution, and affliction; secondly, that they have encouragement to go to him in a low state of religion, to confess their sins, to supplicate his mercy, and to pray for the influences of his Holy Spirit, and the revival of his work; and, thirdly, that the service of God is always attended with rich reward. Idols do not benefit those wire serve them. The pursuit of pleasure, gain, and ambition, is often attended with no reward, and is never attended with any benefits that satisfy the needs of the undying mind; but the service of God meets all the needs of the soul; fills all its desires, and confers permanent and eternal rewards.<p>I the Lord speak righteousness - This stands in opposition to the pagan oracles, which often gave false, delusive, and unjust responses. But not so with God. He had not spoken, as they did, from deep and dark plates - fit emblems of the obscurity of their answers; he had not, as they had, commanded a service that was unprofitable and vain; and he had not, as they had, uttered oracles which were untrue and fitted to delude.<p>I declare things that are right - Lowth renders this, 'Who give direct answers;' and supposes it refers to the fact, that the pagan oracles often give ambiguous and deceitful responses. God never deceived. His responses were always true and unambiguous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. not &#8230; secret&#8212;not like the heathen oracles which gave their responses from dark caverns, with studied obscurity (Isa 48:16).

The “land of darkness” might be the under-world, from which dubious oracles were obtained by necromancy and other magical arts (ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.">1 Samuel 28:7</a> ff.). But the sense is perhaps sufficiently explained (in accordance with what follows) by <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm" title="O generation, see you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to you?">Jeremiah 2:31</a> : “Have I been a wilderness unto Israel, a land of darkness?” Jehovah’s revelation has not been like a dark, trackless desert, but a light in which men might walk towards an assured goal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I said not … Seek ye me in vain</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">in chaos</span> (<span class="ital">tôhû</span>, as <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm" title="For thus said the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:18</a></span>), i.e. without definite guidance and without hope of result. When Jehovah said, “Seek me,” He meant that He should be found (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm" title="And you shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.">Jeremiah 29:13</a>); in other words He has dealt openly and frankly with His people. It is this quality of revelation that is denoted by the word <span class="ital">righteousness</span> in the last line of the verse. It is used in its ethical sense of “trust-worthiness” or straightforwardness,—perfect correspondence between deeds and words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">things that are right</span>] <span class="bld">uprightness</span>. The plural, as always in this word, expresses the abstract idea (see ch. <a href="/isaiah/26-7.htm" title="The way of the just is uprightness: you, most upright, do weigh the path of the just.">Isaiah 26:7</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in a place of the land of darkness.</span> Jehovah's oracles have not been given, like those of the necromancers, or those of the heathen gods, in dark places of the earth - caves like that of Trophonius (Pansan., 9:29, &sect; 2), or the inmost recesses (<span class="accented">adyta</span>) of temples; but openly on Sinai, or by the mouth of prophets who proclaimed his words to all Israel (romp. Dent. 30:11-14, "This commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off<span class="cmt_word">... </span> . But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it"). So our Lord says of his own teaching, "I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and <span class="accented">in secret have I said nothing"</span> (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). Seek ye me in vain; rather, <span class="accented">seek ye me as a chaos</span> (romp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, where God says to his people, "Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness?"). God has no more revealed himself to his people as chaotic, confused, disordered, than he has presented the world to them in this condition.! the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. There is an allusion to the crooked and ambiguous utterances of the heathen oracles, which rarely gave direct answers or plainly expressed any definite meaning. God in his utterances never diverges from the straight line of righteousness and truth (comp. <a href="/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He who created all things, and called all things into existence, had also raised up this Cyrus, whose victorious career had increased the anxieties and fears of the exiles, instead of leading them to lift up their heads, because their redemption was drawing nigh. "I, I have raised him up in righteousness, and all his ways shall I make smooth: He will build my city, and release my banished ones, not for price nor for reward, saith Jehovah of hosts." All the anxieties of the exiles are calmed by the words "in righteousness," which trace back the revolutions that Cyrus was causing to the righteousness of Jehovah, i.e., to His interposition, which was determined by love alone, and tended directly to the salvation of His people, and in reality to that of all nations. And they are fully quieted by the promise, which is now expressed in the clearest and most unequivocal words, that Cyrus would build up Jerusalem again, and set the captivity free (ga&#770;lu&#772;th, as in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>), and that without redemption with money (<a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>) - a clear proof that Jehovah had not only raised up Cyrus himself, but had put his spirit within him, i.e., had stirred up within him the resolution to do this (see the conclusion to the books of Chronicles, and the introduction to that of Ezra). This closes the first half of our sixth prophecy. </body></html>
