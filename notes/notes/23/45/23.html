It is the expression of God's solemn purpose that all nations should yet be brought to acknowledge him, and partake of the benefits of the true religion. The expression, 'I have sworn by myself,' denotes a purpose formed in the most solemn manner, and ratified in the most sacred form. God could swear by no greater <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>; and this, therefore, is the most solemn assurance that could be possibly given that the purpose which he had formed should be executed. To swear by himself is the same as to swear by his life, or to affirm solemnly that the event shall as certainly occur as that he exists. The same idea is often expressed by the phrase, 'as I live.' See a parallel declaration in <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a> : 'But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord' (compare <a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>). This passage is quoted by Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>, where the phrase, 'I have sworn by myself' is rendered, 'as I live, saith the Lord,' showing that they are equivalent expressions.<p>The word is gone out of my mouth - The Septuagint renders this, 'Righteousness shall proceed from my mouth, my words shall not return.' Lowth renders it, 'Truth is gone forth from my mouth; the word, and it shall not be revoked.' Jerome, 'The word of righteousness has gone forth from my mouth, and shall not return.' Rosenmuller accords with the interpretation a of Lowth. Probably the correct translation is 'righteousness' (that is, the righteous sentence, or purpose, where the word &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;  tseda&#770;qa&#770;h is used in the sense of truth, see <a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>), has gone out of my mouth, the word (that is, the promise), and it shall not return.' In this construction the &#1497;  (y) before &#1500;&#1488;  lo' has the force of a relative pronoun, and is to be referred to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  da&#770;ba&#770;r, 'the word.' The sense is, that God had spoken it, and that all which he has spoken shall certainly be fulfilled. The fact that the declaration has once passed his lips, is full proof that the purpose shall be accomplished. This is not to be understood of any promise which he had made before, but it is a solemn declaration which he now makes by the prophet.<p>That unto me every knee shall bow - To bow or bend the knee, is indicative of homage or adoration; and the idea is, that all should yet acknowledge him to be God (see the note at <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>). The ancient mode of offering adoration, or of paying homage, was to place the knee on the ground, and then slowly to incline the body until the head touched the earth. This is practiced now in eastern countries (compare <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>). The obvious and proper signification of this is, that the time would come when God would be everywhere acknowledged as the true God. It refers therefore to the future period of glory on the earth, when all people shall have embraced the true religion, and when idolatry shall have come to an end.<p>Every tongue shall swear - This expression is evidently taken from the practice of taking an oath of allegiance to a sovereign, and here means that all would solemnly acknowledge him to be the true God, and submit themselves to his government and will. See the phrase explained in the the note at <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>. That this refers to the Messiah and his times, is apparent from the fact that it is twice referred to by the apostle Paul, and applied by him to the Lord Jesus and his religion <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>. It is a glorious promise which remains yet to be fulfilled, and there is no promise in the Bible more certain than that this earth shall yet be filled with the knowledge of the true God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. sworn by myself&#8212;equivalent to, "As I live," as Ro 14:11 quotes it.

On the former view <span class="ital">righteousness</span> and <span class="ital">strength</span> are divine attributes; on the latter they are blessings bestowed by Jehovah on men. The rendering of A.V. is preferable, although it is opposed to the Hebr. accents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">righteousness</span>] lit. “righteousnesses,” the idea being intensified by the plural. It is often used of the mighty acts of Jehovah, the individual instances in which His righteous character is manifested (<a href="/1_samuel/12-7.htm" title="Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.">1 Samuel 12:7</a>; Mi. <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/71-15.htm" title="My mouth shall show forth your righteousness and your salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.">Psalm 71:15</a> ff. &c.); here in like manner it must denote the experiences through which a right relation to God is verified.

This universal turning to God belongs to the final Messianic kingdom, prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18-23</a>; and also by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-14</a>) and St. John the Divine (<a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>). The entire destruction of God's enemies is to take place previously (<a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The way in which this God who hides Himself is ultimately revealed as the God of salvation, is then pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a> : "They are put to shame, and also confounded, all of them; they go away into confusion together, the forgers of idols. Israel is redeemed by Jehovah with everlasting redemption: ye are not put to shame nor confounded to everlasting eternities." The perfects are expressive of the ideal past. Jehovah shows Himself as a Savour by the fact, that whereas the makers of idols perish, Israel is redeemed an everlasting redemption (acc. obj. as in <a href="/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>; Ges. 138, 1, Anm. 1), i.e., so that its redemption is one that lasts for aeons (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>) - observe that teshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h does not literally signify redemption or rescue, but transfer into a state of wide expanse, i.e., of freedom and happiness. The plural &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (eternities  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; aeua) belongs, according to Knobel, to the later period of the language; but it is met with as early as in old Asaphite psalms (<a href="/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a>). When the further promise is added, Ye shall not be put to shame, etc., this clearly shows, what is also certain on other grounds - namely, that the redemption is not thought of merely as an outward and bodily one, but also as inward and spiritual, and indeed (in accordance with the prophetic blending of the end of the captivity with the end of all things) as a final one. Israel will never bring upon itself again such a penal judgment as that of the captivity by falling away from God; that is to say, its state of sin will end with its state of punishment, even &#1506;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;, i.e., since &#1506;&#1491; has no plural, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
