Kimchi supposes that it means those who were distinguished among the nations, their chiefs, and rulers; Aben Ezra, that the Babylonians are meant especially; Vitringa, that the phrase denotes proselytes, as those who have escaped from the idolatry of the pagan, and have embraced the true religion; Grotius, that it denotes those who survived the slaughter which Cyrus inflicted on the nations. Rosenmuller coincides in opinion with Vitringa. The word used here (&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;  pa&#770;l&#305;&#770;yt&#803;) denotes properly one who has escaped by flight from battle, danger, or slaughter <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a>. It is not used anywhere in the sense of a proselyte; and the idea here is, I think, that those who escaped from the slaughter which Gyrus would bring on the nations, were invited to come and declare what benefit they had derived from trusting in idol-gods. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>, God had said they should all be ashamed and confounded who thus put their trust in idols; and he here calls on them as living witnesses that it was so. Those who had put their confidence in idols, and who had seen Cyrus carry his arms over nations notwithstanding their vain confidence, could now testify that no reliance was to be placed on them, and could be adduced as witnesses to show the importance of putting their trust in Yahweh.<p>That set up the wood - The word 'wood' is used here to show the folly of worshipping an image thus made, and to show how utterly unable it was to save. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. escaped of the nations&#8212;those of the nations who shall have escaped the slaughter inflicted by Cyrus.

The prophet reverts to the main idea of the section, which is the conversion of the Gentiles, and calls on all "the escaped of the nation" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who have survived the judgments of the time - to "assemble and come," to consider the claims of Jehovah to be the only true God, to "look to him (ver. 22) and be saved." The great judgments through which the heathen will be brought to God have been frequently mentioned (<a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20, 21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11, 12, 25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13-15</a>, etc.). They must not be regarded as limited to the time of Cyrus, but rather as continuing  into the Messianic period, and indeed nearly to its close (see especially ch. 34.). Each one of them constitutes a call to the nations, and is followed by a conversion to a greater or less extent. <span class="cmt_word">They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who lift up</span> (or, carry) <span class="accented">the wood of their graven image</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>, "They bear him upon the shoulder," where the same verb is used). It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or "arks" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101). There would be still among the "escaped" some who would so act. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second half is uttered in the prospect, that the judgment which Cyrus brings upon the nations will prepare the way for the overthrow of heathenism, and the universal acknowledgment of the God of Israel. The heathen submit, as the first strophe or group of vv. (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14-17</a>) affirms, to the congregation and its God; the idolatrous are converted, whilst Israel is for ever redeemed. With the prospect of the release of the exiles, there is associated in the prophet's perspective the prospect of an expansion of the restored church, through the entrance of "the fulness of the Gentiles." "Thus saith Jehovah, The productions of Egypt, and gain of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of tall stature, will come over to thee, and belong to thee: they will come after thee; in chains they will come over, and cast themselves down to thee; they pray to thee, Surely God is in thee, and there is none else; no Deity at all." Assuming that &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; has the same meaning in both cases, the prophet's meaning appears to be, that the Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Meroites (see <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>), who had been enslaved by the imperial power of Persia, would enter the miraculously emancipated congregation of Israel (Ewald). But if they were thought of as in a state of subjugation to the imperial power of Asia, who could the promise be at the same time held out that their riches would pass over into the possession of the church? And yet, on the other hand, the chains in which they come over cannot be regarded, at least in this connection, where such emphasis is laid upon the voluntary character of the surrender, as placed upon them by Israel itself (as in <a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/149-8.htm">Psalm 149:8</a>). We must therefore suppose that they put chains upon themselves voluntarily, and of their own accord, and thus offer themselves spontaneously to the church, to be henceforth its subjects and slaves. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are the nations that we meet with in other passages, where the haereditas gentium is promised to the church, and generally in connection with Tyre (vid., <a href="/psalms/68-32.htm">Psalm 68:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>., <a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>). Whilst the labour of Egypt (i.e., the productions of its labour) and the trade of Ethiopia (i.e., the riches acquired by trade) are mentioned; in the case of Saba the prophecy looks at the tall and handsome tribe itself, a tribe which Agatharchides describes as having &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;. These would place themselves at the service of the church with their invincible strength. The voluntary character of the surrender is pointed out, not only in the expression "they will come over," but also in the confession with which this is accompanied. In other cases the words hithpalle&#772;l 'el are only used of prayer to God and idols; but here it is to the church that prayer is offered. In the prophet's view, Jehovah and His church are inseparably one (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, where "Christ" stands for the church as one body, consisting of both head and members; also the use of the word "worship" in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>, which has all the ring of a passage taken from Isaiah). &#1488;&#1498; is used here in its primary affirmative sense, as in <a href="/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>. There can be no doubt that Paul had this passage of Isaiah in his mind when writing <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</a>, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;, or, according to a better arrangement of the words, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; ( equals  &#1488;&#1498;) &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;.
