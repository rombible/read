We note, as bearing on Isaiah’s studies, the parallelism with <a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1Samuel 2:5</a>.

Some, indeed, understand this chapter of the flourishing condition of the Jewish Church and state after their return from Babylon; but the magnificent promises here following do so vastly exceed their condition at that time, that it must necessarily be referred to the times of the gospel, in which all that is here said was, or will be, remarkably fulfilled. And therefore, as the foregoing chapter directly and literally speaks of Christ: so doth this of the church of Christ, or of the kingdom of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Hebrew doctors understood it. Now this church, consisting at first of the Jews, and afterward of the Gentiles, incorporated with them into the same body, he calls <span class="ital">barren, </span>because she had been so, comparatively speaking, before and until the coming of Christ; few sincere converts having been brought forth to God by her ministry, either of Jewish or Gentile race. <span class="ital">For more are the children of the desolate,</span> &c. — The Gentile world, or the church of the Gentiles, which in the times of the Old Testament was desolate, having neither husband nor children, doth now, under the gospel, bring forth unto God a far more numerous progeny than the church of the Jews, which had been married to God for many ages, until, by her apostacy from him, and from her Messiah, she provoked him to put her away.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>54:1-5 Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a long time before Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel, multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. This is matter of great rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church were extended. Though its state on earth is but mean and movable, like a tent or tabernacle, it is sometimes a growing state, and must be enlarged as the family increases. But the more numerous the church grows, the more she must fortify herself against errors and corruptions. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, the Mediator of the covenant made with the Old Testament church. Long he had been called the God of Israel; but now he shall be called the God of the whole earth. And he will cleanse from sin, and cause every true believer to rejoice in this sacred union. We never can enough admire this mercy, or duly value this privilege.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing, O barren - That is, shout for joy, lift up the voice of exultation and praise. The 'barren' here denotes the church of God under the Old Testament, confined within the narrow limits of the Jewish nation, and still more so in respect to the very small number of true believers, and which seemed sometimes to be deserted of God, her husband (Lowth). It is here represented under the image of a female who had been destitute of children, and who now has occasion to rejoice on the reconciliation of her husband (<a href="/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>; Lowth), and on the accession of the Gentiles to her family. The Chaldee renders it, 'Rejoice, O Jerusalem, who hast been as a sterile woman that did not bear.' The church is often in the Bible compared to a female, and the connection between God and his people is often compared with that between husband and wife (compare <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>).<p>Thou that didst not bear - Either referring to the fact that the church was confined within the narrow limits of Judea; or that there had been in it a small number of true believers; or addressed to it in Babylon when it was oppressed, and perhaps constantly diminishing in number. I think it probable that it refers to the latter; and that the idea is, that she saw her sons destroyed in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, and that she was not augmented by any accessions while in Babylon, but would have great occasion for rejoicing on her return, and in her future increase under the Messiah by the accession of the Gentiles.<p>Break forth into singing - (Compare <a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>).<p>For more are the children of the desolate - The 'desolate' here refers to Jerusalem, or the church. By the 'married woman,' Rosenmuller supposes the prophet means other nations which flourished and increased like a married woman. Grotius supposes that he means other cities which were inhabited, and that Jerusalem would surpass them all in her prosperity and in numbers. But the phrase seems to have somewhat of a proverbial cast, and probably the idea is that there would be a great increase, a much greater increase than she had any reason to apprehend. As if a promise was made to a barren female that she should have more children than those who were married usually had, so Jerusalem and the church would be greatly enlarged, far beyond what usually occurred among nations. The fulfillment of this is to be looked for in the accession of the Gentiles <a href="/isaiah/54-3.htm">Isaiah 54:3</a>. 'The conversion of the Gentiles is all along considered by the prophet as a new accession of adopted children, admitted into the original church of God, and united with it' (Lowth). See the same idea presented at greater length in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/54.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 54<p>Isa 54:1-17.

And although this chapter is by some understood of the flourishing condition of the Jewish church and state after their return from Babylon, yet the magnificent and glorious promises here following do so vastly exceed their condition at that time, which was full of uncertainties, and distractions, and troubles, as all the histories of those times assure us, and far from that glory and lasting tranquillity which is here assured to her, that it must necessarily be referred to the times of the gospel, in which all that is here said was or will be remarkably fulfilled. And therefore as the foregoing chapter doth directly and literally speak of Christ, so doth this literally speak of the church of Christ, or of the kingdom of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Hebrew doctors understood it. And this church, consisting at first of the Jews, and afterwards of the Gentiles, who were incorporated with them into the same body, he calleth <span class="ital">barren</span>, not because it now was so, but because before and until the coming of Christ it had been so; as Simon is called the leper, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a></span>, after he was cured. Now this church of the Jews might well be called, and had been, barren, because the sincere converts brought forth to God by her ministry had been but few among the Jews comparatively, and simply few among the Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">More are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife:</span> the church or congregation of the Gentiles, which in the times of the Old Testament was desolate, having neither husband nor children, doth now under the gospel bring forth unto God a far more numerous posterity than the church of the Jews, which had been married to God for many ages, until by her apostacy from God, and from her Messiah, she provoked God to put her away, He alludeth here either to the history of Sarah, who was long and naturally barren, but by the supernatural power of God was enabled to bring forth a numberless issue; or to that remarkable passage of God’s providence concerning Hannah and Peninnah, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1 Samuel 2:5</a></span>, <span class="ital">The barren hath born seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/54.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear,.... The Targum interprets this of Jerusalem, paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"sing praise, O Jerusalem, which was as a barren woman that bears not;'' <p>and so the apostle applies the words of the text to the Jerusalem above, the mother of us all, the then present Gospel church, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>, which, at the first setting of it up, in the times of Christ, during his life and at the time of his death, and before the day of Pentecost, was like a barren woman; the number of converts were very small; few believed the report of the Gospel, professed Christ, and submitted to his ordinances; the names of the disciples were but a hundred and twenty. Though some understand this of the Jewish church, under the Old Testament dispensation, whose members were not many, and whose proselytes from the Gentiles were but few; and others of the Gentile world, before the coming of Christ, and the preaching of the Gospel in it; but the former sense is to be preferred, having the suffrage of the apostle: <p>break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; among whom there were few instances of conversion, scarce any begotten and born again of incorruptible seed by the word of God, and no signs thereof; but now it being otherwise, and multitudes being converted both in Judea and in the Gentile world, the church and its members are called upon to express their joy aloud in songs of praise, setting forth the glory of efficacious grace, in the regeneration of men; for as this is matter of joy to the angels of heaven, so to the saints on earth: <p>for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord; more souls were born again, and added to the church after the death of Christ, when she was in a desolate condition, like a woman deprived of her husband, and in a widowhood state, then there were while Christ was here on earth, personally present with his people, and preaching the Gospel himself unto men; three thousand were converted under one sermon, and great numbers afterwards were added, so that the church at Jerusalem was in a much more flourishing condition after the death of Christ than before; more fruitful when it was become like a widow than when the bridegroom was with her; and the church of Christ still increased yet more and more afterwards, as the following verses predict. The Targum is, <p>"more shall be the children of Jerusalem than the children of the habitable city.'' <p>The edition of it, in the king of Spain's Bible, has it, <p>"than the children of Rome;'' <p>and so it is quoted by R. Elias (h), and by Buxtorf (i). The Jews understand this prophecy of their deliverance from their present condition by the Messiah; and of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the prosperity of it. <p>(h) In Tishbi, p. 227. (i) Lexic.

Vers. 1-5 take up the thought of <a href="/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-21</a>, and expand it. Israel is assured of a great enlargement of her numbers, and bidden to rejoice thereat.

She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5).

"He was ill treated; whilst He suffered willingly, and opened not His mouth, like the sheep that is led to the slaughter-bench, and like a lamb that is dumb before its shearers, and opened not His mouth." The third pers. niphal stands first in a passive sense: He has been hard pressed (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>): He is driven, or hunted (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>), treated tyrannically and unsparingly; in a word, plagued (vexatus; compare the niphal in a reciprocal sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>, and according to the reading &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474; in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> in a reflective sense, to torment one's self).

And so here, where &#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (from which comes the participle &#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, usually met with in circumstantial clauses) has not a passive, but a reflective meaning, as in <a href="/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a> : "He was ill treated, whilst He bowed Himself ( equals  suffered voluntarily), and opened not His mouth" (the regular leap from the participle to the finite). The voluntary endurance is then explained by the simile "like a sheep that is led to the slaughter" (an attributive clause, like <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>); and the submissive quiet bearing, by the simile "like a lamb that is dumb before its shearers." The commentators regard &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; as a participle; but this would have the tone upon the last syllable (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-11.htm">Nahum 3:11</a>; cf., Comm. on Job, at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a>, note). The tone shows it to be the pausal form for &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, and so we have rendered it; and, indeed, as the interchange of the perfect with the future in the attributive clause must be intentional, not quae obmutescit, but obmutuit. The following words, &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, do not form part of the simile, which would require tiphtach, for nothing but absolute necessity would warrant us in assuming that it points back beyond &#1512;&#1495;&#1500; to &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as Rashi and others suppose. The palindromical repetition also favours the unity of the subject with that of the previous &#1497;&#1508;&#1514;&#1495; and the correctness of the delicate accentuation, with which the rendering in the lxx and <a href="/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a> coincides. All the references in the New Testament to the Lamb of God (with which the corresponding allusions to the passover are interwoven) spring from this passage in the book of Isaiah. </body></html>
