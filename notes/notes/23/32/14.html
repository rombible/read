Or, if it refers, as Lowth supposes, to the invasion of the land in the time of the Chaldeans, then it relates to the palaces in Jerusalem. Vitringa supposes that the temple at Jerusalem is particularly designated by the word rendered palaces. But that is not the usual word to denote the temlple, and it is not necessary to suppose that that is particularly referred to. The word &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  'armo&#770;n usually denotes a palace, or royal residence in some part of the royal citadel (see <a href="/1_kings/16-18.htm">1 Kings 16:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-7.htm">Amos 1:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-10.htm">Amos 1:10</a>, <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>).<p>The forts - Margin, 'Cliffs and watch-towers.' Hebrew, &#1506;&#1508;&#1500;  &#8219;opel. This word properly denotes a hill or a cliff, such as is an advantageous situation for fortresses.

With the article (the hill) it was given, by way of eminence, to a bluff or hilt lying northeast of mount Zion, and south of mount Moriah, which was surrounded and fortified with a wall (Jos. Jewish Wars, vi. 6). It extends south from mount Moriah, running down to the fountain of Siloam, lying between the valley of Jehoshaphat on the east, and the Tyropeon or valley of Cheesemongers on the west. It terminates over the pool of Siloam in a steep point of rock forty or fifty feet high. The top of the ridge is flat, and the ground is now tilled, and planted with olive and other fruit trees (see Robinson's Bib. Researches, vol. i. pp. 341, 394). It may be used here, however, to denote a hill or cliff, a strongly-fortified place in general, without supposing of necessity that it refers to the mountain in Jerusalem.<p>Towers - Towers were erected on the walls of cities at convenient distances for purposes of observation.<p>Shall be for dens - Shall become places where banditti and robbers may abide, and secure themselves.<p>Forever - This is evidently one instance in which the word 'forever' (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;  &#8219;ad-&#8219;o&#770;la&#770;m), denotes a long time, because in the verse When the word is used without any suet limitation, it denotes proper eternity<p>A joy of wild asses - A place where wild animals will have unlimited range. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. palaces&#8212;most applicable to Jerusalem (see on [748]Isa 32:13).<p>multitude &#8230; left&#8212;the noisy din of the city, that is, the city with its noisy multitude shall lie forsaken [Maurer].<p>forts&#8212;rather, "Ophel" (that is, the mound), the term applied specially to the declivity on the east of Zion, surrounded with its own wall (2Ch 27:3; 33:14; 2Ki 5:24), and furnished with "towers" (or watchtowers), perhaps referred to here (Ne 3:26, 27).<p>for ever&#8212;limited by thee, "until," &c., Isa 32:15, for a long time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The palaces, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the palace</span>; the king’s house, and other magnificent buildings in the city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be left; </span> or rather, <span class="ital">shall be forsaken</span>, to wit, of God, and given up into their enemies’ hands.

The palaces of the princes and nobles shall be forsaken by them, they being obliged to flee from the enemy, or being taken, and either slain, or carried captive. The word in the Hebrew is in the singular number, "the palace", meaning the royal palace; and so Aben Ezra and Jarchi interpret it of the king's palace; though the Targum paraphrases it the house of the sanctuary, or the temple, so Kimchi; which was left desolate, as Christ foretold it should be, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>, <p>the multitude of the city shall be left; to take care of themselves, and to the fury of their enemies, their princes and nobles being killed or fled; or, "the city shall be left of the multitude" (p); the multitude of inhabitants that were in it shall forsake it, and flee, or be destroyed in it, so that few or none shall remain: <p>the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever; Ophel and Bachan, which some take to be the names of two towers of Jerusalem; of Ophel we read in <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a> but rather these intend in general the high towers and strong fortifications of Jerusalem, which being cut out of rocks, when demolished served for dens for thieves and robbers, and wild creatures; and this being "for ever", that is, for a very long time, shows that it cannot be applied to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and the seventy years' captivity; but it is to be understood of the last destruction, which continues unto this day: <p>a joy of wild asses; which delight in wild and desert places; see <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>. <p>a pasture of flocks; where flocks of sheep feed, instead of being inhabited by men. Jarchi's note is pretty remarkable, <p>"for the desire, or at the will, of the Ishmaelites, and for the feeding of the Grecians, and their army;'' <p>and certain it is that Jerusalem now is in the hands of the Ishmaelites, or Turks.

The tenses are prophetic perfects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the forts and towers</span>] Better as in R.V.: <span class="bld">the hill and the watch tower</span>. The first word is <span class="ital">‘Ophel</span>, the name of the southern projection of the hill on which the temple stood (<a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm" title="Moreover the Nethinims dwelled in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lies out.">Nehemiah 3:26</a> f., <a href="/nehemiah/11-21.htm" title="But the Nethinims dwelled in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.">Nehemiah 11:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm" title="Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and is doubtless mentioned as the aristocratic quarter of the city, near the royal palace. The word translated “watch tower” occurs nowhere else, and is of uncertain significance; probably, like Ophel, it denotes a particular locality in the capital.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The phrase <span class="ital">for ever</span> must be understood in a relative sense, being restricted by the “until” of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.">Isaiah 32:15</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verse contains an absolute and explicit prediction of the complete overthrow of Jerusalem. Dillmann’s assertion that such an expectation must have been expressed in different language is inexplicable, and his distinction between destruction and desolation is sophistical. Surprising as this idea may be alongside of certain passages in this section of the book, it is not to be explained away, and after all it does not go very much beyond what is said in ch. <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>. For a complete parallel, however, we must go back to the early prophecy of ch. <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm" title="Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-17.htm" title="Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.">Isaiah 5:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The palaces shall be forsaken</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the palace</span>; but the word is used in a generic sense. The prophet sees in vision Jerusalem deserted by her inhabitants, the grand houses of the rich empty, the strongholds haunted by wild beasts, and the slopes of the hills fed on by sheep, and even occasionally visited by the timid and solitude-loving wild ass. The description suits well the time of the Babylonian captivity, but not any earlier period. Probably it was not revealed to the prophet how soon the condition would be reached. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the city shall be left</span>. The real meaning is, as Bishop Lowth expresses it, "The populous city shall be left desolate." But the whole passage is. as Delitzsch observes, "grammatically strange, the language becoming more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet." <span class="cmt_word">The forts and towers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hill and tower</span>, with (perhaps) a special reference to the part of Jerusalem called Ophel (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, etc.), the long projecting spur from the eastern hill, which points a little west of south, and separates the Kedron valley from the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for dens</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for caves</span>; but dens for wild beasts seem to be meant (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For ever</span>. This expression must not be pressed. Hyperbole is a recognized feature of poetry written under strong excitement. <span class="cmt_word">A joy of wild asses</span>. The wild ass is not now found nearer Palestine than Mesopotamia, or perhaps Northern Syria. It is exceedingly shy, and never approaches the habitations of men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A third fruit of the blessing is the naming and treating of every one according to his true character. "The fool will no more be called a nobleman, nor the crafty a gentleman. For a fool speaks follies, and his heart does godless things, to practise tricks and to speak error against Jehovah, to leave the soul of hungry men empty, and to withhold the drink of thirsty ones. And the craft of a crafty man is evil, who devises stratagems to destroy suffering ones by lying words, even when the needy exhibits his right. But a noble man devises noble things, and to noble things he adheres." Nobility of birth and wealth will give place to nobility of character, so that the former will not exist or not be recognised without the latter. Na&#770;d&#305;&#772;bh is properly one who is noble in character, and then, dropping the ethical meaning, one who is noble by rank. The meaning of the word generosus follows the same course in the opposite direction. Sho&#772;a&#774;&#8219; is the man who is raised to eminence by the possession of property; the gentleman, as in <a href="/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>. The prophet explains for himself in what sense he uses the words na&#770;bha&#770;l and k&#305;&#772;lai. We see from his explanation that k&#305;&#772;lai neither signifies the covetous, from ku&#772;l (Saad.), nor the spendthrift, from killa&#770;h (Hitzig). Jerome gives the correct rendering, viz., fraudulentus; and Rashi and Kimchi very properly regard it as a contraction of nekh&#305;&#772;lai. It is an adjective form derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>). The form &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> is used interchangeably with this, merely for the sake of the resemblance in sound to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (machinatoris machinae pravae). In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, commencing with ki (for), the fact that the na&#770;bha&#770;l (fool) and k&#305;&#772;lai (crafty man) will lose their titles of honour, is explained on the simple ground that such men are utterly unworthy of them. Na&#770;bha&#770;l is a scoffer at religion, who thinks himself an enlightened man, and yet at the same time has the basest heart, and is a worthless egotist. The infinitives with Lamed show in what the immorality ('a&#770;ven) consists, with which his heart is so actively employed. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, u&#772;bhedabbe&#772;r ("and if he speak") is equivalent to, "even in the event of a needy man saying what is right and well founded:" Va&#770;v  equals  et in the sense of etiam ((cf., <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>); according to Knobel, it is equivalent to et quidem, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>; <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a>; <a href="/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>; whereas Ewald regards it as Vav conj. (283, d), "and by going to law with the needy," but &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; would be the construction in this case (vid., <a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>, not only does the noble man devise what is noble, but as such (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;) he adheres to it. We might also adopt this explanation, "It is not upon gold or upon chance that he rises;" but according to the Arabic equivalents, qu&#772;m signifies persistere here. </body></html>
