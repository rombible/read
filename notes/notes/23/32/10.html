This is a literal translation of the Hebrew. Septuagint, 'Make mention of a day of a year in sorrow, with hope.' Targum, 'Days with years.' Kimchi supposes it means 'two years.' Grotius supposes it means 'within three years.' Various other interpretations may be seen in Poole's Synopsis. Gesenius renders it, 'For a year's time,' according to the common expression 'a year and a day,' denoting a complete year, and supposes that it means a considerable time, a long period. The phrase literally means 'the days. upon (or beyond) a year,' and may denote a long time; as the entire days in a year would denote a long period of suffering. Lowth renders it, not in accordance with the Hebrew, 'Years upon years.' Noyes, 'One year more, and ye shall tremble.' Perhaps this expresses the sense; and then it would denote not the length of time which they would suffer, but would indicate that the calamities would soon come upon them.<p>For the vintage shall fail - A large part of the wealth and the luxury of the nation consisted in the vintage. When the vine failed, there would be, of course, great distress. The sense is, that in consequence of the invasion of the Assyrians, either the people would neglect to cultivate the lands, or they would fail to collect the harvest. This might occur either from the dread of the invasion, or because the Assyrian would destroy everything in his march. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

As the wheat harvest is omitted, Isaiah must look for the invasion in the summer or autumn of 714 B.C., when the wheat would have been secured already, and the later fruit "gathering," and vintage would be still in danger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Many days and years, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">Days above a year</span>, i.e. a year and some days; which notes either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Kimchi says it may be interpreted of the destruction of the whole land of Israel, and of the destruction of the temple in the days of Zedekiah; or of the destruction of the second temple, that is, by the Romans: <p>for the vintage shall fail; being spoiled by the enemy, or taken for their own use; and so there would be no wine to cheer their hearts, and make them merry: <p>the gathering shall not come; of the other fruits of the earth; when the time of ingathering should come, at which there was a feast that bore that name, there should be none to be gathered in; the consequence of which must be a famine, and such there was before and at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. <p>(k)   "dies super annum", Vatablus; "dies ultra annum", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Many days and years shall ye be troubled, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> ye careless women: <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.</span><p>(g) Meaning that the affliction would continue long and when one year was past, yet they should look for new plagues.<p>(h) God will take from you the means and opportunities, which made you contemn him: that is, abundance of worldly goods.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Many days and years</span>] The Hebr. reads literally “days beyond a year,” probably a current popular phrase like “year and day.” Both A.V. and R.V. regard the expression as accus. of duration, but the context shews that it fixes the point of time when ease and security give place to anxiety. The meaning is “in little more than a year.” Comp. the less definite note of time in ch. <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm" title="Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelled! add you year to year; let them kill sacrifices.">Isaiah 29:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The feature of the judgment which is emphasised is the failure of the vintage and the fruit harvest (<span class="ital">gathering</span>); what follows shews that this is not the result of natural causes, but of a wholesale devastation of the land. The significance of the prediction would depend greatly on the season of the year at which it was uttered; on any natural interpretation of his words, the prophet means to assert that the next year’s harvest will never be gathered.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many days and years shall ye</span>  <span class="cmt_word">be troubled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in a year and days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in less than two years." The object of the prophet is not to fix the duration of the trouble, but to mark the time of its commencement (comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye be troubled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall ye tremble</span>, or <span class="accented">shudder</span> (so <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye careless women</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye confident ones</span>.

Some critics understand a literal failure, or destruction, of the vintage through the invasion of the Assyrians. Others suggest a refer-once to <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4-7</a>. The vineyard of the Lord (Judah) has utterly failed to bring forth grapes - there is no ingathering - therefore destruction shall fall upon it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second is an opened understanding, following upon the ban of hardening. "And the eyes of the seeing no more are closed, and the ears of the hearing attend. And the heart of the hurried understands to know, and the tongue of stammerers speaks clear things with readiness." It is not physical miracles that are predicted here, but a spiritual change. The present judgment of hardening will be repealed: this is what <a href="/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3</a> affirms. The spiritual defects, from which many suffer who do not belong to the worst, will be healed: this is the statement in <a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is not the future of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; here, as in <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7-8</a> (in the sense of, they will no longer stare about restlessly and without aim), but of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, a metaplastic future of the latter, in the sense of, to be smeared over to closed (see <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; cf., tach in <a href="/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18</a>). On qa&#770;shabh (the kal of which is only met with here), see at <a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>. The times succeeding the hardening, of which Isaiah is speaking here, are "the last times," as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a> clearly shows; though it does not therefore follow that the king mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> (as in <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>.) is the Messiah Himself. In <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> the prophet merely affirms, that Israel as a national commonwealth will then be governed in a manner well pleasing to God; here he predicts that Israel as a national congregation will be delivered from the judgment of not seeing with seeing eyes, and not hearing with hearing ears, and that it will be delivered from defects of weakness also. The nimha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m are those that fall headlong, the precipitate, hurrying, or rash; and the &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;, stammerers, are not scoffers (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>., <a href="/isaiah/19-20.htm">Isaiah 19:20</a>), as Knobel and Drechsler maintain, but such as are unable to think and speak with distinctness and certainty, more especially concerning the exalted things of God. The former would now have the gifts of discernment (ya&#770;bh&#305;&#772;n), to perceive things in their true nature, and to distinguish under all circumstances that which is truly profitable (la&#770;da&#8219;ath); the latter would be able to express themselves suitably, with refinement, clearness, and worthiness. Tsacho&#772;th (old ed. tsa&#770;cho&#772;th) signifies that which is light, transparent; not merely intelligible, but refined and elegant. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; gives the adverbial idea to ledabbe&#772;r (Ewald, 285, a). </body></html>
