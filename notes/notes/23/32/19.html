Not a few commentators refer the words here also to Assyria, but the city that follows is clearly Jerusalem, and the interpretation given above harmonises accordingly better with the context.

There is a paranomasia in the original here, which cannot be expressed in a translation - a figure of speech, which, as we have seen, is common in Isaiah. 'Hail' is an image of divine vengeance or punishment; and the reference here is, doubtless, to the storms of indignation that would come on the enemies of the Jews, particularly on the Assyrians (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>).<p>Coming down on the forest - Coming down on the army of the Assyrian, which is here called 'a forest.' The same term 'forest' is given to the army of the Assyrians in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18-19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>. The sense is, that the divine judgment would come down on that army with as much severity as a storm of hail descends on a forest - stripping the leaves from the trees, destroying its beauty, and laying it waste.<p>And the city - According to Gesenius, this is Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian empire. According to Rosenmuller, Grotius, and others, it is Babylon. Hensler supposes that it is Jerusalem, and that the sense is, that as a city that is situated in a valley is safe when the storm and tempest sweep over the hills, so would it be to Jerusalem when the storm of wrath should sweep away the army of the Assyrian. But the connection evidently requires us to understand it of the capital of the enemy; though whether it be Nineveh or Babylon perhaps cannot be determined.<p>Shall be low in a low place - Margin, 'Utterly abased.' Hebrew, 'In humility shall be humbled.' The sense is, shall be completely prostrate. Those who refer this to Jerusalem suppose it refers to the time when God should humble it by bringing the enemy so near, and exciting so much consternation and alarm. Those who refer it to Babylon suppose it relates to its destruction. If referred to Nineveh, it must mean when the pride of the capital of the Assyrian empire should be iratabled by the complete overthrow of their army, and the annihilation of their hopes. The connection seems to require us to adopt this latter interpretation. The whole verse is very obscure; but perhaps the above will express its general sense. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Literally, "But it shall hail with coming down of the forest, and in lowness shall the city (Nineveh) be brought low; that is, humbled." The "hail" is Jehovah's wrathful visitation (Isa 30:30; 28:2, 17). The "forest" is the Assyrian host, dense as the trees of a forest (Isa 10:18, 19, 33, 34; Zec 11:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And it shall hail</span>, &c.

The people of God will be peaceable and quiet, safe and secure, when the judgments of God, signified by a "hail" storm, shall come upon antichrist, and the antichristian states, intended by the "forest", both for their numbers, and for their barrenness and unfruitfulness; see <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a> and as so it sometimes is, by the disposition of divine Providence, that a storm of hail falls not upon fields and gardens, and the fruits of the earth, but upon forests and desert lands; and as the plague of hail fell upon the Egyptians, and not upon the Israelites in Goshen, to which some think the allusion is here; so will it be when God comes to take vengeance on the enemies of his people: <p>and the city shall be low in a low place: meaning not the city of Jerusalem, surrounded with mountains, built under hills, and so under the wind, and not exposed to the fury of a storm; but rather Babylon, built in a plain, in a low plain, and yet should be brought lower still; mystical Babylon is here meant, the city of Rome, that should "in humiliation be humbled", as the words may be rendered, that is, brought very low, exceeding low; see <a href="/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a> and which, at the time of the great hail, will be divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations shall fall, and Babylon be had in remembrance by the Lord to destroy it, <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> city shall be low in a low place.</span><p>(m) They will not need to build it in high places for fear of the enemy: for God will defend it, and turn away the storms from hurting their conveniences.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. The verse reads: <span class="bld">And it shall hail at the falling of the forest, and in lowliness shall the city be laid low</span>. According to most commentators the “forest” is a symbol for Assyria, as in ch. <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm" title="And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.">Isaiah 10:18</a> f., 33 f. But this is suggested by nothing in the context, and the “city” in the next line cannot be Nineveh, which is never referred to by Isaiah, and is far from his thoughts here. The verse as a whole must (if genuine) be taken as an announcement of judgment on Jerusalem; but it comes in so awkwardly between <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/32-18.htm" title="And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;">Isaiah 32:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-20.htm" title="Blessed are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.">Isaiah 32:20</a></span>, that it may not unreasonably be regarded as an interpolation. On the “hail” as a synonym for Divine judgment see ch. <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm" title="Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm" title="Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.">Isaiah 28:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm" title="And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.">Isaiah 30:30</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but it shall hail in the coming down</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the destruction) <span class="accented">of the forest</span>. "The forest" has commonly been regarded as Assyria, on the strength of <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>. Mr. Cheyne, however, suggests Judah, or the high and haughty ones of Judah, whose destruction was a necessary preliminary to the establishment of Christ's kingdom. May not God's enemies generally be meant? <span class="cmt_word">The city.</span> Nineveh (Lowth, Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller); Jerusalem (Delitzsch, Knobel, Cheyne, Kay); "the city in which the hostility of the world to Jehovah will, in the latter days, be centralized" (Drechsler, Nagel) - the "world-power," in fact. The last view seems to give the best sense. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This short address, although rounded off well, is something more than a fragment complete in itself, like the short parabolic piece in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23-29</a>, which commences in a similar manner. It is the last part of the fourth woe, just as that was the last part of the first. It is a side piece to the threatening prophecy of the time of Uzziah-Jotham (<a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>.), and chastises the frivolous self-security of the women of Jerusalem, just as the former chastises their vain and luxurious love of finery. The prophet has now uttered many a woe upon Jerusalem, which is bringing itself to the verge of destruction; but notwithstanding the fact that women are by nature more delicate, and more easily affected and alarmed, than men, he has made no impression upon the women of Jerusalem, to whom he now foretells a terrible undeceiving of their carnal ease, whilst he holds out before them the ease secured by God, which can only be realized on the ruins of the former.<p>The first part of the address proclaims the annihilation of their false ease. "Ye contented women, rise up, hear my voice; ye confident daughters, hearken to my speech! Days to the year: then will ye tremble, confident ones! for it is all over with the vintage, the fruit harvest comes to nought. Tremble, contented ones! Quake, ye confident ones! Strip, make yourselves bare, and gird your loins with sackcloth! They smite upon their breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. On the land of my people there come up weeds, briers; yea, upon all joyous houses of the rejoicing city. For the palace is made solitary; the crowd of the city is left desolate; the ofel and watch-tower serve as caves for ever, for the delight of wild asses, for the tending of flocks." The summons is the same as in <a href="/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-19.htm">Jeremiah 9:19</a> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23</a>); the attributes the same as in <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>, where Isaiah apostrophizes the women of Samaria). &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, lively, of good cheer; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, trusting, namely to nothing. They are to rise up (qo&#772;mna&#770;h), because the word of God must be heard standing (<a href="/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>). The definition of the time "days for a year" (ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m &#8219;al-sha&#770;na&#770;h) appears to indicate the length of time that the desolation would last, as the word tirgazna&#770;h is without any Vav apod. (cf., <a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16-18</a>); but <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> shows us differently, and the Vav is omitted, just as it is, for example, in <a href="/daniel/4-28.htm">Daniel 4:28</a>. Sha&#770;na&#770;h is the current year. In an undefined number of days, at the most a year from the present time (which is sometimes the meaning of ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m), the trembling would begin, and there would be neither grapes nor fruit to gather. Hence the spring harvest of corn is supposed to be over when the devastation begins. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is an acc. temporis; it stands here (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>, for example; vid., Ewald, 293, 1) to indicate the starting point, not the period of duration. The milel-forms &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1492;, &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1495;&#1490;&#1512;&#1492; ,&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; , are explained by Ewald, Drechsler, and Luzzatto, as plur. fem. imper. with the Nun of the termination na&#770;h dropped - an elision that is certainly never heard of. Others regard it as inf. with He femin. (Credner, Joel, p. 151); but &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492; for the infinitive &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492; is unexampled; and equally unexampled would be the inf. with He indicating the summons, as suggested by Bttcher, "to the shaking!" "to the stripping!" They are sing. masc. imper., such as occur elsewhere apart from the pause, e.g., &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492; (for which the keri has &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;) in <a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>; and the singular in the place of the plural is the strongest form of command. The masculine instead of the feminine appears already in &#1492;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, which is used in the place of &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492;. The prophet then proceeds in the singular number, comprehending the women as a mass, and using the most massive expression. The He introduced into the summons required that the feminine forms, &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;&#1497;, etc., should be given up. &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to be naked, to strip one's self. &#1495;&#1490;&#1512;&#1492; absolute, as in <a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>), signifies to gird one's self with sackcloth (saq). We meet with the same remarkable enall. generis in <a href="/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>. Men have no breasts (sha&#770;daim), and yet the masculine so&#772;phed&#305;&#772;m is employed, inasmuch as the prophet had the whole nation in his mind, throughout which there would be such a plangere ubera on account of the utter destruction of the hopeful harvest of corn and wine. Sha&#770;daim (breasts) and &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; (construct to sa&#770;do&#772;th) have the same common ring as ubera and ubertas frugum. In <a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a> ta&#8219;a&#774;leh points back to qo&#772;ts sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r, which is condensed into one neuter idea. The ki in <a href="/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a> has the sense of the Latin imo (Ewald, 330, b). The genitive connection of &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; with &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (joy-houses of the jubilant city) is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>. The whole is grammatically strange, just as in the Psalms the language becomes all the more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet. Hence the short shrill sentences in <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a> : palace given up (cf., <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>); city bustle forsaken (i.e., the city generally so full of bustle, <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>). The use of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is the same as in <a href="/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a>; <a href="/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a>. &#8219;Ofel, i.e., the south-eastern fortified slope of the temple mountain, and the bachan (i.e., the watch-tower, possibly the flock-tower which is mentioned in <a href="/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a> along with &#8219;ofel), would be pro speluncis, i.e., would be considered and serve as such. And in the very place where the women of Jerusalem had once led their life of gaiety, wild asses would now have their delight, and flocks their pasture (on the wild asses, pera&#770;'&#305;&#772;m, that fine animal of the woodless steppe, see at <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5-8</a>). Thus would Jerusalem, with its strongest, proudest places, be laid in ruins, and that in a single year, or ever less than a year. </body></html>
