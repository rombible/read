It cannot be doubted that this is the general reference of the passage, but there does not seem to be a necessity of making a division here. The entire prophecy, including the whole chapter, relates in general to the reign of Hezekiah; and as these events were to occur during his reign, the prophet groups them together, and presents them as constituting important events in his reign. The general design of this portion of the prophecy <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-14</a> is to show the desolation that would come upon the land of Judea in consequence of that invasion. This he represents in a poetical manner, by calling on the daughters of fashion and ease to arouse, since all their comforts were to be taken away.<p>Ye women that are at ease - They who are surrounded by the comforts which affluence gives, and that have no fear of being reduced to wang (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-26</a>).<p>Ye careless daughters - Hebrew, 'Daughters confiding;' that is, those who felt no alarm, and who did not regard God and his threatenings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-20. Address to the women of Jerusalem who troubled themselves little about the political signs of the times, but lived a life of self-indulgence (Isa 3:16-23); the failure of food through the devastations of the enemy is here foretold, being what was most likely to affect them as mothers of families, heretofore accustomed to every luxury. Vitringa understands "women&#8212;daughters" as the cities and villages of Judea (Eze 16:1-63).

The Jews interpret them of the other cities of Judea, besides Jerusalem; the Targum explains it by provinces: <p>hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear to my speech; the words of the prophet concerning the future desolation of their country; here it is thought the lesser towns and villages are intended by daughters, who dwelt in confidence and security, having no thought and notion of destruction coming upon them; so Ben Melech interprets the "women" of cities, and the "daughters" of villages. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> careless daughters; give ear to my speech.</span><p>(f) He prophecies of such calamity to come that they will not spare the women and children, and therefore wills them to take heed and provide.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. The women are addressed partly as representing best certain aspects of the public mind, luxury and complacent ease (ch. <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16</a> ff.; <a href="/amos/4-1.htm" title="Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.">Amos 4:1</a> ff.); partly because of their function as mourners in seasons of calamity (<a href="/jeremiah/9-20.htm" title="Yet hear the word of the LORD, O you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.">Jeremiah 9:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that are at ease … careless</span>] (or, <span class="bld">confident</span>) cf. <a href="/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/32-9.htm" title="Rise up, you women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear to my speech....">Isaiah 32:9-20</a> To the Women of Jerusalem<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Like the previous sections (<a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm" title="Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelled! add you year to year; let them kill sacrifices.">Isaiah 29:1</a> ff., <a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm" title="Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?">Isaiah 29:15</a> ff., Isaiah 30, 31) this passage is divided into two parts,—the announcement of judgment on Jerusalem, and a description of the Messianic salvation (see the analysis below). It presents, however, two remarkable peculiarities: (1) there is no reference to the overthrow of the Assyrians, and (2) it contemplates a complete destruction of Jerusalem and a protracted desolation of the land. For these reasons some critics have been led to assign the prophecy to a period much earlier than the invasion of Sennacherib; and this would be plausible if it were possible to separate the two parts of which it is composed (9–14 and 15–20). But this is difficult on account of the close connexion established by <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.">Isaiah 32:15</a></span>; and since the latter portion presents some literary affinities with the other members of this group of discourses (ch. 28–31) it will probably be safer to regard the whole as belonging to the same period. It is possible, no doubt, that the Messianic conclusion might have been written later than the address to the women; but even on that assumption we should have to admit that the prophet retained the conception of an indefinitely prolonged depopulation of the land, at a late stage of his career.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The contents of the prophecy are as follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/32-9.htm" title="Rise up, you women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear to my speech....">Isaiah 32:9-14</a></span>. A threatening oration, addressed to the women of Jerusalem. The introduction (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm" title="Rise up, you women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear to my speech.">Isaiah 32:9</a></span>) shews that what roused the ire of the prophet was the careless unconcern and indifference of the women in face of the reiterated warnings he had uttered. He endeavours to shake them out of their light-hearted security by the announcement that “the ingathering shall not come” (10). So clear is the vision of calamity that he calls on his hearers to adopt the attitude of mourners over the ravaged vineyards, the desolate fields, and the deserted palaces of the “jubilant city” (11–14).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ii. <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest....">Isaiah 32:15-20</a></span>. Out of this state of collapse and ruin there will ultimately arise, but after an indefinite period, a new world. Under the vivifying influence of the Divine spirit, external nature will be renewed (15), righteousness will dwell in the land (16), and its blessed fruits will be undisturbed peace and security (17, 18). An unexpected allusion to the judgment (19) somewhat mars the continuity of the passage, which ends with a prophetic felicitation of the peaceful and industrious peasantry who inherit the golden age (20).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - A REBUKE OF THE WOMEN. It might seem at first sight as if we had here a detached utterance of the prophet, accidentally conjoined with the preceding passage (vers. 1-8). But vers. 15-18 furnish a link of connection between the two portions of the chapter, and make it probable that they were delivered at the same time. Mr. Cheyne supposes that the indifference of a knot of women, gathered at some little distance from the men to whom Isaiah had addressed vers. 1-8, provoked the prophet suddenly to turn to them, and speak to them in terms of warning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up</span>. The "careless daughters" are sitting, or reclining upon couches, at their ease. The prophet bids them stand up, to hear a message from God (comp. <a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye women that are at ease</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that are self-satisfied and self-complacent." The word employed has almost always a bad sense (see <a href="/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hear my voice</span>. This clause should be attached to the first half of the verse. The order of the words in the original is, "Ye women that are at ease, rise up and hear my words; ye careless daughters, hearken unto my speech." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second is an opened understanding, following upon the ban of hardening. "And the eyes of the seeing no more are closed, and the ears of the hearing attend. And the heart of the hurried understands to know, and the tongue of stammerers speaks clear things with readiness." It is not physical miracles that are predicted here, but a spiritual change. The present judgment of hardening will be repealed: this is what <a href="/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3</a> affirms. The spiritual defects, from which many suffer who do not belong to the worst, will be healed: this is the statement in <a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is not the future of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; here, as in <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7-8</a> (in the sense of, they will no longer stare about restlessly and without aim), but of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, a metaplastic future of the latter, in the sense of, to be smeared over to closed (see <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; cf., tach in <a href="/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18</a>). On qa&#770;shabh (the kal of which is only met with here), see at <a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>. The times succeeding the hardening, of which Isaiah is speaking here, are "the last times," as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a> clearly shows; though it does not therefore follow that the king mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> (as in <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>.) is the Messiah Himself. In <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> the prophet merely affirms, that Israel as a national commonwealth will then be governed in a manner well pleasing to God; here he predicts that Israel as a national congregation will be delivered from the judgment of not seeing with seeing eyes, and not hearing with hearing ears, and that it will be delivered from defects of weakness also. The nimha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m are those that fall headlong, the precipitate, hurrying, or rash; and the &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;, stammerers, are not scoffers (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>., <a href="/isaiah/19-20.htm">Isaiah 19:20</a>), as Knobel and Drechsler maintain, but such as are unable to think and speak with distinctness and certainty, more especially concerning the exalted things of God. The former would now have the gifts of discernment (ya&#770;bh&#305;&#772;n), to perceive things in their true nature, and to distinguish under all circumstances that which is truly profitable (la&#770;da&#8219;ath); the latter would be able to express themselves suitably, with refinement, clearness, and worthiness. Tsacho&#772;th (old ed. tsa&#770;cho&#772;th) signifies that which is light, transparent; not merely intelligible, but refined and elegant. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; gives the adverbial idea to ledabbe&#772;r (Ewald, 285, a). </body></html>
