But although these expressions are, in some sort, applicable to Hezekiah and his good reign, they are much more true of Christ and his reign, as are also several other expressions here used, especially those in the third and fourth verses, which evidently relate to happier times than Hezekiah lived to see.

Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, a king - That is, Hezekiah. That it refers to him is apparent from the connection. The reign of Ahaz had been one of oppression and idolatry. This was to be succeeded by the reign of one under whom the rights of the people would be secured, and under whom there would be a state of general prosperity. This may have been uttered while Ahaz was on the throne, or it may have been when Hezekiah began to reign. Perhaps the latter is the more probable, as Ahaz might not have tolerated anything that would have looked like a reflection on his own reign; nor, perhaps, while he was on the throne would Isaiah have given a description that would have been a contrast between his reign and that of his successor.<p>Shall reign in righteousness - That is, a righteous king shall reign; or his administration shall be one of justice, and strongly in contrast with that of his predecessor.

Lowth proposes to read this without the &#1500;  (l), as the ancient versions do. But it is not necessary to change the text. It may be rendered, 'As to princes, they shall rule' (compare <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a>).

For this is certain, and confessed by all, that the prophecies are not always set down in that order in which the prophets delivered them. The foregoing prophecy seems to have been delivered, not in the time of Ahaz, for he sent to the Assyrian, and not to the Egyptian, for help; but in the days of Hezekiah, <span class="ital">who rebelled against the king of Assyria</span>, as is said, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm" title="And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.">2 Kings 18:7</a></span>, and was too prone to trust upon the staff of Egypt, as the Assyrian expressly chargeth him there, to which course it is likely he was drawn or tempted by some of his wicked princes and counsellors, whom the prophet therefore severely censures and condemns in the two foregoing chapters. And this seems to have been delivered in the time of Ahaz, and to speak of Hezekiah, and of his righteous and happy government. But withal, as Hezekiah and his reign was an eminent type of Christ, and of his kingdom; so this prophecy looks through Hezekiah unto Christ, as many other scriptures in their literal sense do unquestionably concern David, which yet have a mystical sense, and are also meant of Christ, in whom those things were more fully and eminently accomplished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A king; </span> Hezekiah, a type of Christ, and Christ typified by him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall reign; </span> therefore Hezekiah was not king when this prophecy was delivered.

It is characteristic of Isaiah that the renovation of society is represented as commencing at the top, with the king and aristocracy. (Cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm" title="And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.">Isaiah 1:26</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water....">Isaiah 3:1-7</a>) The ideal king has already been described (ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace....">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:...">Isaiah 11:1-4</a>) as supernaturally endowed with the virtues of a perfect ruler; here the emphasis lies on the manifestation of these qualities in righteous government; and this, according to the constitutional principles of Isaiah’s time, required an order of state officials animated by the same spirit as the king himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/32-1.htm" title="Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment....">Isaiah 32:1-8</a>. The ideal commonwealth of the Messianic Age<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This passage, although treated by many expositors as the continuation of ch. 31, bears all the marks of an independent prophecy. Its insertion in the present group of discourses is sufficiently explained by the picture it gives of a reformed upper class, in contrast with the irreligious and unscrupulous nobility against whom the previous chapters have been mainly directed. The time of its actual composition cannot be determined with certainty, but it is perhaps most naturally assigned to the close of Isaiah’s ministry, when his mind was occupied with the hope of the ideal future. Much has been made of the fact that the figure of the Messianic King (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm" title="Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.">Isaiah 32:1</a></span>) is less idealised than in the great prophecies of ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations....">Isaiah 9:1-6</a> and <a href="/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:...">Isaiah 11:1-4</a>. But this circumstance is easily accounted for by the leading idea of the prophecy (which is the transformation of social relationships), and cannot be safely used as a criterion of date. Still less does it furnish an argument against the Isaianic authorship of the passage. It is true, however, that in its somewhat laboured didactic style, and in the terms employed, the passage differs widely from anything else in the acknowledged writings of Isaiah; and the suggestion that it may have owed its final literary form to a later hand cannot be altogether ignored.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The contents of the prophecy are as follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/32-1.htm" title="Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment....">Isaiah 32:1-2</a></span>. A perfectly just and beneficent government will be established; king and nobles alike being endowed with the virtues necessary for their office, and yielding protection to the poor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/32-3.htm" title="And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall listen....">Isaiah 32:3-4</a></span>.

The consequences of this will be that “the aristocracy of birth and wealth will be replaced by an aristocracy of character” (Delitzsch); men will find their proper level and be estimated at their true worth (5). To this is appended an analysis of the two contrasted types, the “churl” and the true nobleman (6–8).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - A PROPHECY OF MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is generally allowed that this prophecy is Messianic; but some critics insist that it is not so "in a narrow sense." They regard Isaiah as expecting Messiah's kingdom to follow immediately on the discomfiture of Sennacherib, and as looking to Hezekiah to inaugurate it. According to this view, Hezekiah, renovated in character, was to be the Messiah, and might have been so had he been "equal to the demands providentially made upon him." But he was not; and the task of establishing the kingdom fell to "another," at a later date. It is simpler to regard the prophet as looking for a greater than Hezekiah (comp. <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), but ignorant how soon, or how late, his coming would be. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A king... princes</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "the king... the princes;" but the Hebrew gives no article. The announcement is vague, and corresponds to those of other prophets, as of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), "Behold, the days come that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper;" and of Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion... behold, thy <span class="accented">King</span> cometh unto thee." The "princes" of the text are the minor authorities whom the king would set over his kingdom - i.e., the apostles and their successors. <span class="cmt_word">In righteousness... in judgment</span>. Messiah's rule will be a rule of strict justice and right, offering the strongest contrast to that under which the Jews have been living since the time of Jehoshaphat (see <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-12</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And things of this kind would occur. "For thus hath Jehovah spoken to me, As the lion growls, and the young lion over its prey, against which a whole crowd of shepherds is called together; he is not alarmed at their cry, and does not surrender at their noise; so will Jehovah of hosts descend to the campaign against the mountain of Zion, and against their hill." There is no other passage in the book of Isaiah which sounds so Homeric as this (vid., Il. xviii. 161, 162, xii. 299ff.). It has been misunderstood by Knobel, Umbreit, Drechsler, and others, who suppose &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; to refer to Jehovah's purpose to fight for Jerusalem: Jehovah, who would no more allow His city to be taken from Him, than a lion would give up a lamb that it had taken as its prey. But how could Jerusalem be compared to a lamb which a lion holds in its claws as tereph? (<a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>). We may see, even from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, what construction is meant to be put upon &#1506;&#1500; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;. Those sinners and their protectors would first of all perish; for like a fierce indomitable lion would Jehovah advance against Jerusalem, and take it as His prey, without suffering Himself to be thwarted by the Judaeans and Egyptians, who set themselves in opposition to His army (The Assyrians). The mountain of Zion was the citadel and temple; the hill of Zion the city of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>). They would both be given up to the judgment of Jehovah, without any possibility of escape. The commentators have been misled by the fact, that a simile of a promising character follows immediately afterwards, without anything to connect the one with the other. But this abrupt &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; was intended as a surprise, and was a true picture of the actual fulfilment of the prophecy; for in the moment of the greatest distress, when the actual existence of Jerusalem was in question (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>), the fate of Ariel took suddenly and miraculously a totally different turn (<a href="/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>). In this sense, a pleasant picture is placed side by side with the terrible one (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6-7</a>). </body></html>
