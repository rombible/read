The definiteness of the language of <a href="/isaiah/9-20.htm" title="And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:">Isaiah 9:20</a> suggests the thoughts of the horrors of a famine like that of Samaria (<a href="/context/2_kings/6-28.htm" title="And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.">2Kings 6:28-29</a>), or of <a href="/context/deuteronomy/28-53.htm" title="And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you:">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-9.htm" title="Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.">Zechariah 11:9</a>. But even that scene of horror might be only typical of a state of chaos and confusion pervading the whole order of society, fierce passions, jealousies, rivalries working out the destruction of the nation’s life; such as Thucydides (iii. 82-84) has painted as the result of the Peloponnesian war. The mention of Ephraim and Manasseh as conspicuous in the self-destructive work confirms the figurative interpretation. They were devouring “the flesh of their own arm” when they allowed their old tribal jealousies (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites?

The only power of union that showed itself in the northern kingdom was to perpetuate the great schism in which it had its origin. The idea that Israel as such was a nation was forgotten. Ephraim and Manasseh could join in a common expedition against Judah when they could join in nothing else. Of this the alliance of Pekah with Rezin was the most striking instance (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-6.htm" title="For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 28:6-15</a>). Traces of internal division are found in the conspiracy of the Gileadites of the trans-Jordanic district of Manasseh, against Pekah’s predecessor in Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm" title="But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.">2Kings 15:25</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through the wrath - By the anger, or indignation.

This sense of the word, which is only to be met with in this place, is given by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, from the use of it in the Arabic language, in which it signifies (f) darkness; but the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "the whole land is burned"; and which is confirmed by the Targum, which so interprets it; and this sense well agrees with the context: <p>and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; this explains who are meant by the briers and thorns, and thickets of the forest, the inhabitants of the land of Israel; who, as they are the fuel of fire, were the objects of divine wrath and fury: <p>no man shall spare his brother; which may be ascribed either to the darkness and confusion in which they should be, and so not be able to discern a friend from a foe, as persons surrounded with smoke; or to their malignant spirit, cruelty and inhumanity, not only doing ill to their enemies, but to their own friends and relations, to their own flesh and blood. <p>(f) "obscura evasit", ---- "tertia pars noctis, a fine crepusculi, tempus quo posterior peragitur precatio vespertina", Golius, col. 1521, 1522.

"But the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth it, and they seek not Jehovah of hosts. Therefore Jehovah rooteth out of Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day. Elders and highly distinguished men, this is the head; and prophets, lying teachers, this is the tail. The leaders of this people have become leaders astray, and their followers swallowed up. Therefore the Lord will not rejoice in their young men, and will have no compassion on their orphans and widows: for all together are profligate and evil-doers, and every mouth speaketh blasphemy. With all this His anger is not turned away, and His hand is stretched out still." As the first stage of the judgments has been followed by no true conversion to Jehovah the almighty judge, there comes a second. &#1506;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (to turn unto) denotes a thorough conversion, not stopping half-way. "The smiter of it" (hammacce&#772;hu), or "he who smiteth it," it Jehovah (compare, on the other hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, where Asshur is intended). The article and suffix are used together, as in <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a> (vid., Ges. 110, 2; Caspari, Arab. Gram. 472). But there was coming now a great day of punishment (in the view of the prophet, it was already past), such as Israel experienced more than once in the Assyrian oppressions, and Judah in the Chaldean, when head and tail, or, according to another proverbial expression, palm-branch and rush, would be rooted out. We might suppose that the persons referred to were the high and low; but <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a> makes a different application of the first double figure, by giving it a different turn from its popular sense (compare the Arabic er-ru 'u&#772;s w-aledhna&#770;b  equals  lofty and low, in Dietrich, Abhandlung, p. 209). The opinion which has very widely prevailed since the time of Koppe, that this v. is a gloss, is no doubt a very natural one (see Hitzig, Begriff der Kritik; Ewald, Propheten, i. 57). But Isaiah's custom of supplying his own gloss is opposed to such a view; also Isaiah's composition in <a href="/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>, and the relation in which this v. stands to <a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>; and lastly, the singular character of the gloss itself, which is one of the strongest proofs that it contains the prophet's exposition of his own words. The chiefs of the nation were the head of the national body; and behind, like a wagging dog's tail, sat the false prophets with their flatteries of the people, loving, as Persius says, blando caudam jactare popello. The prophet drops the figure of Cippa&#770;h, the palm-branch which forms the crown of the palm, and which derives its name from the fact that it resembles the palm of the hand (instar palmae manus), and agmo&#772;n, the rush which grows in the marsh.<p>(Note: The noun agam is used in the Old Testament as well as in the Talmud to signify both a marshy place (see Baba mesi'a 36b, and more especially Aboda zara 38a, where giloi agmah signifies the laying bare of the marshy soil by the burning up of the reeds), and also the marsh grass (Sabbath 11a, "if all the agmim were kalams, i.e., writing reeds, or pens;" and Kiddsin 62b, where agam signifies a talk of marsh-grass or reed, a rush or bulrush, and is explained, with a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>, as signifying a tender, weak stalk). The noun agmon, on the other hand, signifies only the stalk of the marsh-grass, or the marsh-grass itself; and in this sense it is not found in the Talmud (see Comm on Job, at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10-13</a>). The verbal meaning upon which these names are founded is evident from the Arabic ma&#770; a&#772;gim (magu&#772;m), "bad water" (see at <a href="/isaiah/19-10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>). There is no connection between this and maugil, literally a depression of the soil, in which water lodges for a long time, and which is only dried up in summer weather.)<p>The allusion here is to the rulers of the nation and the dregs of the people. The basest extremity were the demagogues in the shape of prophets. For it had come to this, as <a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a> affirms, that those who promised to lead by a straight road led astray, and those who suffered themselves to be led by them were as good as already swallowed up by hell (cf., <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>). Therefore the Sovereign Ruler would not rejoice over the young men of this nation; that is to say, He would suffer them to be smitten by their enemies, without going with them to battle, and would refuse His customary compassion even towards widows and orphans, for they were all thoroughly corrupt on every side. The alienation, obliquity, and dishonesty of their heart, are indicated by the word Cha&#770;ne&#772;ph (from Cha&#770;naph, which has in itself the indifferent radical idea of inclination; so that in Arabic, Chan&#305;&#772;f, as a synonym of &#8219;a&#770;dil,<p>(Note: This is the way in which it should be written in Comm on Job, at <a href="/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>; &#8219;adala has also the indifferent meaning of return or decision.)<p>has the very opposite meaning of decision in favour of what is right); the badness of their actions by &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; (in half pause for &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;<p>(Note: Nevertheless this reading is also met with, and according to Masora finalis, p. 52, <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/8.htm">Colossians 8</a>, this is the correct reading (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>, where it is doubtful whether the meaning is a friend or a malevolent person). The question is not an unimportant one, as we may see from Olshausen, 258, p. 581.)<p> equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, maleficus); the vicious infatuation of their words by neba&#770;la&#770;h. This they are, and this they continue; and consequently the wrathful hand of God is stretched out over them for the infliction of fresh strokes. </body></html>
