The “adversaries” of the text can hardly be any other than the Assyrians; yet the context that follows clearly points to an attack on Ephraim in which the armies of Rezin were to be conspicuous. The natural explanation is that Syria, after the conquest by the Assyrian king (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>), was compelled to take part in a campaign against Samaria. The reading of the text may be retained with this explanation, and the sentence paraphrased thus, “Jehovah will stir up the adversaries of Rezin (the Assyrians who have conquered Syria) against him (Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria), and shall join his enemies against him, and those enemies shall include the very nations on whose support he had counted, the Syrians and the Philistines” (<a href="/context/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7-8</a>). The latter people were, it is true, enemies to Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.">2Chronicles 28:18</a>), but their hostilities extended to the northern kingdom also.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - This verse indicates the punishment that would come upon them for their pride.<p>The Lord shall set up - Hebrew, 'Shall exalt.'

"Against him" means "against Ephraim," or the kingdom of Israel. "The adversaries of Rezin" could only be the Assyrians; but these seem precluded by the next verse, which mentions only "Syrians" and Philistines." Hence many critics accept the variant reading of several manuscripts <span class="accented">sarey</span> for <span class="accented">tsarey - which</span> gives the sense of "the <span class="accented">princes</span> of Rezin" (so Lowth, Ewald, Houbigant, Weir, Cheyne). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For every boot of those who tramp with boots in the tumult of battle, and cloak rolled in blood, shall be for burning, a food of fire." That which is the food of fire becomes at the same time a se&#774;re&#772;pha&#770;h, inasmuch as the devouring fire reduces it to ashes, and destroys its previous existence. This closing statement requires for &#1505;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; the concrete sense of a combustible thing; and this precludes such meanings as business (Handel und Wandel), noise, or din ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, Jerome, Syriac, Rashi, and others). On the other hand, the meaning "military equipment," adopted by Knobel and others - a meaning derived from a comparison of the derivatives of the Aramaean zu&#772;n, a&#774;zan, and the Arabic za&#770;na, fut. yez&#305;&#772;n (to dress or equip) - would be quite admissible; at the same time, the interchange of Samech and Zain in this word cannot be dialectically established. Jos. Kimchi has very properly referred to the Targum se&#772;n, mesa&#770;n (Syr. also sa&#770;u&#772;n with an essentially long a), which signifies shoe (see Bynaeus, de calceo Hebraeorum) - a word which is more Aramaean than Hebrew, and the use of which in the present connection might be explained on the ground that the prophet had in his mind the annihilation of the Assyrian forces. We should no doubt expect sa&#770;'u&#772;n (sandaloumenos) instead of so&#772;'e&#772;n; but the denom. verb sa&#770;'a&#774;n might be applied to a soldier's coming up in military boots, and so signify Caligatum venire, although the primary meaning is certainly Calceare se (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-15.htm">Ephesians 6:15</a>, Syr.). Accordingly we should render it, "every boot of him who comes booted (des Einherstiefelnden) into the tumult of battle," taking the word ra&#8219;ash, not as Drechsler does, in the sense of the noise made by a warrior coming up proudly in his war-boots, nor with Luzzatto in the sense of the war-boot itself, for which the word is too strong, but as referring to the noise or tumult of battle (as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>), in the midst of which the man comes up equipped or shod for military service. The prophet names the boot and garment with an obvious purpose. The destruction of the hostile weapons follows as a matter of course, if even the military shoes, worn by the soldiers in the enemies' ranks, and the military cloaks that were lying in da&#770;mim, i.e., in blood violently shed upon the battle-field, were all given up to the fire. </body></html>
