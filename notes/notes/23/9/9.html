For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And all the people shall know - Shall know the message; or shall know the judgment which God denounces against their crimes.

"The nation" (haggoi) is undoubtedly Israel, reduced to a small remnant. That God would make this again into a numerous people, was a leading feature in the pictures drawn of the time of glory (<a href="/isaiah/26-15.htm">Isaiah 26:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-8.htm">Isaiah 66:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10-11</a>), which would be in this respect the counterpart of that of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>). If our explanation is the correct one so far, the only way to give an intelligible meaning to the chethib &#1500;&#1488;, taking it in a negative sense, is to render it, as Hengstenberg, Hitzig, and others have done, "Thou multipliest the nation to which Thou hadst formerly not given great joy," which must signify, per litoten, "the nation which Thou hadst plunged into deep sorrow." But it is unnatural to take any one of the prophetic preterites, commencing with hicb&#305;&#772;d in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, in any other than a future sense. We must therefore give the preference to the Keri &#1500;&#1493;, and render it, "Thou makest of the nation a great multitude, and preparest it great joy." The pronoun loo is written first, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-7.htm">Leviticus 7:7-9</a>; <a href="/job/41-4.htm">Job 41:4</a> (keri), probably with the emphasis assumed by Drechsler: "to it, in which there was not the smallest indication of such an issue as this." The verbs "multiplied" (higdalta&#770;) and "increased" (hirbitha&#770;) are intentionally written together, to put the intensity of the joy on a level with the extensiveness of the multitude. This joy would be a holy joy, as the expression "before Thee" implies: the expression itself recals the sacrificial meals in the courts of the temple (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>). It would be a joy over blessings received, as the figure of the harvest indicates; and joy over evil averted, as the figure of dividing the spoil presupposes: for the division of booty is the business of conquerors. This second figure is not merely a figure: the people that are so joyous are really victorious and triumphant.<p>(Note: On the passages in which &#1500;&#1488; chethib is &#1500;&#1493; keri, see at <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> and <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>.) </body></html>
