That Jesus was ‘Thy Holy Servant’ was the earliest gospel preached by Peter and John before people and rulers. It is not the most vital conception of our Lord’s nature and work. The prophet does not here pierce to the core, as in his fifty-third chapter with its vision of the Suffering Servant, but this is prelude to that, and the office assigned here to the Servant cannot be fully discharged without that ascribed to Him there, as the prophet begins to discern almost immediately. The text gives us a striking view of the purpose of Messiah’s mission and of His training and preparation for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The purpose of Christ’s mission.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>There is a remarkable contrast between the stately prelude to the section of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.">Isaiah 49:1</a> - <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm" title="And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 49:26</a>, and the ideal in this text. There the Servant calls the isles and the distant peoples to listen, and declares that His mouth is ‘like a sharp sword’; here all that is keen and smiting in His word has softened into gentle whispers of comfort to sustain the weary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A mission addressed to ‘the weary’ is addressed to every man, for who is not ‘weighed upon with sore distress,’ or loaded with the burden and the weight of tasks beyond his power or distasteful to his inclinations, or monotonous to nausea, or prolonged to exhaustion, or toiled at with little hope and less interest? Who is not weary of himself and of his load? What but universal weariness does the universal secret desire for rest betray? We are all ‘pilgrims weary of time,’ and some of us are weary of even prosperity, and some of us are worn out with work, and some of us buffeted to all but exhaustion by sorrow, and all of us long for rest, though many of us do not know where to look for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Jesus may have had this word in mind, when He called to Him all them ‘that labour and are heavy laden.’ At all events, the prophet’s ideal and the evangelists’ story accurately correspond. Christ’s words have other characteristics, but are eminently words that sustain the weary and comfort the down-hearted. Who can ever calculate the new strength poured by them into fainting hearts and languid hands, the all but dead hopes that they have reanimated, the sorrows they have comforted, the wounds they have stanched?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What a lesson here as to the noblest use of high endowments! What a contrast to the use that so many of those to whom God has given ‘the tongue of them that are taught’ make of their great gifts! Literature yields but few examples of great writers who have faithfully employed their powers for that purpose, which seems so humble and is so lofty, the help of the weary, the comfort of the sad. Many pages in famous books would be cancelled if all that had been written without consideration for these classes were obliterated, as it will be one day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But Christ not only speaks by outward words, but has other ways of lodging sustenance and comfort in souls than by vocables audible to the ear or visible to the eye on the page. ‘The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.’ He spoke by His deeds on earth, and in one and the same set of facts, He ‘began to do and to teach,’ the doing being named first. He ‘now speaketh from Heaven’ by many an inward whisper, by the communication of His own Spirit, on Whom this very office of ministering sustenance and comfort is laid, and whose very name of the Comforter means One who by his being with a man strengthens him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The training and preparation of the Messiah for His mission.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Messiah is here represented as having the tongue of ‘them that are taught,’ and as having it, because morning by morning He has been wakened to hear God’s lessons. He is thus God’s scholar-a thought of which an unreflecting orthodoxy has been shy, but which it is necessary to admit unhesitatingly and ungrudgingly, if we would not reduce the manhood of Jesus to a mere phantasm. He Himself has said, ‘As the Father taught Me, I speak these things.’ With emphatic repetition, He was continually making that assertion, as, for instance, ‘I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which sent Me, He gave Me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak . . . the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto Me, so I speak.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Gospels tell us of the prayers of Jesus, and of rare occasions in which a voice from heaven spoke to Him. But while these are palpable instances of His communion with God, and precious tokens of His true brotherhood with us in the indispensable characteristics of the life of faith, they are but the salient points on which the light falls, and behind them, all unknown by us, stretches an unbroken chain of like acts of fellowship. In that subordination as of a scholar to teacher, both His divine and His human nature concurred, the former in filial submission, the latter in continual, truly human derivation and reception. The man Jesus was taught and, like the boy Jesus, ‘increased in wisdom.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But while He learned as truly as we learn from God, and exercised the same communion with the Father, the same submission to Him, which other men have to exercise, and called ‘us brethren, saying, I will put my trust in Him,’ the difference in degree between His close fellowship with God the Father, and our broken and always partial fellowship, between His completeness of reception of God’s words and our imperfect comprehension, between His perfect reproduction of the words He had heard and our faint, and often mistaken echo of them, is so immense as to amount to a difference in kind. His unity of will and being with the Father ensured that all His words were God’s. ‘Never man spake like this man.’ The man who speaks to us once for all God’s words must be more than man. Other men, the highest, give us fragments of that mighty voice; Jesus speaks its whole message, and nothing but its message. Of that perfect reproduction He is calmly conscious, and claims to give it, in words which are at once lowly and instinct with more than human authority: ‘All things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you.’ Who besides Him dare make such a claim? Who besides Him could make it without being met by incredulous scorn? His utterance of the Father’s words was unmarred by defect on the one hand, and by additions on the other. It was like pure water which tastes of no soil. His soul was like an open vessel plunged in a stream, filled by the flow and giving forth again its whole contents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That divine communication to Jesus was no mere impartation of abstractions or ‘truths,’ still less of the poor words of man’s speech, but was the flowing into His spirit of the living Father by whom He lived. And it was unbroken. ‘Morning by morning’ it was going on. The line was continuous, whereas for the rest of us, at the best, it is a series of points more or less contiguous, but with dark spaces between. ‘God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, then, let us hold fast by Him, the Son in whom God has spoken to us, and to all voices without and within that would woo us to listen, let us answer with the only wise answer: ‘To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/50.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned.">Isaiah 50:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord God hath given me, </span>&c. — The second discourse of the fifth part of Isaiah’s prophecies, according to Vitringa, begins here, and is continued to the seventeenth verse of the following chapter. God having, in the preceding paragraph, asserted his own power; to manifest the unreasonableness of the infidelity of the Jews, and that it was without all excuse, he proceeds to show what excellent and powerful means he used to bring them to repentance and salvation. This and the following passages may be, in some sort, understood of the Prophet Isaiah, but they are far more evidently and eminently verified in Christ, and indeed seem to be meant directly of him. To understand them in this light seems to suit best with the context, for, according to this exposition, the same person speaks here, who is the chief subject of the preceding chapter, and who has spoken in the foregoing verses of this chapter. There, indeed, he speaks as God, but here as man, being both God and man, as is abundantly evident from many passages, both of the Old and New Testaments.

He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, Ro 8:33.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord God hath given me - This verse commences a new subject, and the deliverer is directly introduced as himself speaking. The reasons why this is supposed to refer to the Messiah, have been given in the analysis to the chapter. Those reasons will be strengthened by the examination of the particular expressions in the passage, and by showing, as we proceed in the exposition, in what way they are applicable to him. It will be assumed that the reference is to the Messiah; and we shall find that it is a most beautiful description of his character, and of some of the principal events of his life. This verse is designed to state how he was suited for the special work to which he was called. The whole endowment is traced to Yahweh. It was he who had called him; he who had given him the tongue of the learned, and he who had carefully and attentively qualified him for his work.<p>The tongue of the learned - Hebrew, 'The tongue of those who are instructed;' that is, of the eloquent; or the tongue of instruction (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  paideias, Septuagint); that is, he has qualified me to instruct others. It does not mean human science or learning; nor does it mean that any other had been qualified as he was, or that there were any others who were learned like him. But it means that on the subject of religion he was eminently endowed with intelligence, and with eloquence. In regard to the Redeemer's power of instruction, the discourses which he delivered, as recorded in the New Testament, and especially his sermon on the mount, may be referred to. None on the subject of religion ever spake like him; none was ever so well qualified to instruct mankind (compare <a href="/matthew/13-54.htm">Matthew 13:54</a>).<p>That I should know how to speak a word in season - The Hebrew here is, 'That I might know how to strengthen with a word the weary;' that is, that he might sustain, comfort, and refresh them by his promises and his counsels. How eminently he was suited to alleviate those who were heavy laden with sin and to comfort those who were burdened with calamities and trials, may be seen by the slightest reference to the New Testament, and the most partial acquaintance with his instructions and his life. The weary here are those who are burdened with a sense of guilt; who feel that they have no strength to bear up under the mighty load, and who therefore seek relief (see <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p>He wakeneth morning by morning - That is, he wakens me every morning early. The language is taken from an instructor who awakens his pupils early, in order that they may receive instruction. The idea is, that the Redeemer would be eminently endowed, under the divine instruction and guidance, for his work. He would be one who was, so to speak, in the school of God; and who would be qualified to impart instruction to others.<p>He wakeneth mine ear - To awaken the ear is to prepare one to receive instruction. The expressions, to open the ear, to uncover the ear, to awaken the ear, often occur in the Scriptures, in the sense of preparing to receive instruction, or of disposing to receive divine communications. The sense here is plain. The Messiah would be taught of God, and would be inclined to receive all that he imparted.<p>To hear as the learned - Many translate the phrase here 'as disciples,' that is, as those who are learning. So Lowth; 'With the attention of a learner.' So Noyes; 'In the manner of a disciple.' The Septuagint renders it, 'He has given me an ear to hear.' The idea is, probably, that he was attentive as they are who wish to learn; that is, as docile disciples. The figure is taken from a master who in the morning summons his pupils around him, and imparts instruction to them. And the doctrine which is taught is, that the Messiah would be eminently qualified, by divine teaching, to be the instructor of mankind. The Chaldee paraphrases this, 'Morning by morning, he anticipates (the dawn), that he may send his prophets, if perhaps they my open the ears of sinners, and receive instruction.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Messiah, as "the servant of Jehovah" (Isa 42:1), declares that the office has been assigned to Him of encouraging the "weary" exiles of Israel by "words in season" suited to their case; and that, whatever suffering it is to cost Himself, He does not shrink from it (Isa 50:5, 6), for that He knows His cause will triumph at last (Isa 50:7, 8).<p>learned&#8212;not in mere human learning, but in divinely taught modes of instruction and eloquence (Isa 49:2; Ex 4:11; Mt 7:28, 29; 13:54).<p>speak a word in season&#8212;(Pr 15:23; 25:11). Literally, "to succor by words," namely, in their season of need, the "weary" dispersed ones of Israel (De 28:65-67). Also, the spiritual "weary" (Isa 42:3; Mt 11:28).<p>wakeneth morning by morning, &c.&#8212;Compare "daily rising up early" (Jer 7:25; Mr 1:35).

He "learned obedience," experimentally, "by the things which He suffered"; thus gaining that practical learning which adapted Him for "speaking a word in season" to suffering men (Heb 5:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God having asserted his own power, to show the groundlessness of the infidelity of the Jews, he proceeds to show what excellent and effectual means he used to bring them to repentance and salvation; which he mentions as a great aggravation of their unbelief and rebellion, which by this means was without all excuse. This and the following passages may be in some sort understood of the prophet Isaiah, though but obscurely and imperfectly; but they are far more evidently and eminently verified in Christ, and indeed seem to be meant directly of him. For seeing there are many other passages in this prophecy which are directly meant of Christ, and of his ministry, and not at all of the prophet, why may not this be added to the number of them? especially considering that there is nothing here which forceth us to understand this place of Isaiah, and several of these passages are expounded of Christ in the New Testament, as is confessed. Besides, this seems to suit best with the coherence; for according to this exposition the same person speaketh here who hath spoken in all the foregoing verses of the chapter, even the Lord himself considered as man, because he was both God and man, as is abundantly evident from many scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament, as hath been already proved, and will hereafter be more fully evinced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The tongue of the learned; </span> an ability of speaking plainly, and convincingly, and persuadingly, and in all points so as becometh a person taught of God, and filled with all Divine and heavenly wisdom and knowledge, and with a singular skill of winning souls, and of working upon men’s hearts and consciences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Him that is weary; </span> burdened with the sense of his sad and deplorable condition, in which case a word of comfort is most seasonable and acceptable.

As those that are or desire and endeavour, up to be learned use to hear with all possible attention and diligence; for this title of <span class="ital">learned</span> is in the former part of the verse given not to the teacher, who is said to be God, but to the person taught by him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/50.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned,.... These are not the words of the prophet, as Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and others think; though what is here said is applicable to ministers of the word, who have to do with weary souls, and it is their work to comfort and refresh them; and which work requires knowledge and experience of their case, a good degree of elocution to speak aptly and with propriety, even to have the tongue of the learned, especially in a spiritual sense; as such have who have learned of the Father, and have been taught by the Spirit of God, and are well versed in the Scriptures, and can speak in the taught words of the Holy Ghost, comparing spiritual things with spiritual; and they have need of great prudence to time things right, to speak fitly and opportunely, and give to each their portion in due season, to whom they minister; and also great diligence and assiduity in prayer, reading, and meditation; and such as are teachers of others must be the Lord's hearers, and should be very diligent and attentive ones; all which are gifts from the Lord, and to be ascribed to him. But the words are to be understood of Christ, the same person that is speaking in the preceding verses; who being anointed by the Spirit of the Lord God, as man, whose gifts and graces he received without measure, he was abundantly qualified for the discharge of his prophetic office; and was capable of speaking as never man did, and with such power and authority as the Scribes and Pharisees did not, and with so much wisdom and eloquence as were surprising to all that heard him; he had the Spirit of wisdom on him, and the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid in him: <p>that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary; not only saints, weary with sin, their own and others, and with troubles from the world, from Satan, and by afflictive providences; but sinners under first awakenings, distressed and uneasy in their minds at a sight of sin, in its exceeding sinfulness; pressed with the guilt of it, filled with a sense of divine wrath on account of it, and terrified with the thoughts of death, and a future judgment; and are weary with labouring for bread which satisfies not, for righteousness and life, and in seeking for resting places, being in want of spiritual rest, peace, and comfort; and who are hungry and thirsting after righteousness, after pardoning grace and mercy, after Christ and salvation by him, after his word and ordinances, after communion with him, and conformity to him; who are weak and without strength, and ready to faint for want of refreshment. The word for "weary" signifies "thirsty", according to Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech; who explain it of persons that thirst after hearing the word of the Lord: the Targum is, <p>"to know how to teach the righteous that weary themselves at the words of the law;'' <p>or, as some render it, that pant after the words of the law: but not the law, but the Gospel, is "the word in season", to be spoken to weary souls; which proclaims pardon, preaches peace, is the word of righteousness and salvation; which directs hungry and thirsty souls to Christ, as the bread and water of life, and invites weary ones to him for rest. That word of his, <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a> is a word in season to such persons: such a word Christ spoke when he was here on earth in his own person, and now speaks by his ministers in the preaching of the Gospel, and by his Spirit applying it to his people. <p>He wakeneth morning by morning; one after another continually, meaning himself; the allusion is to masters calling their scholars early to their studies; the morning being the fittest season for instruction and learning. <p>He wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned; who hear attentively, and with great pleasure and profit. This and the preceding clause seem to denote both the earliness in which Christ entered on his prophetic office, and his attentiveness in hearkening to all that was said in the eternal council and covenant by his divine Father; which he, as the Prophet of his church, makes known unto his people, <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Lord GOD hath given <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <i>him that is</i> <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> weary: he awakeneth morning by morning, he awakeneth my ear to hear <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> as the learned.</span><p>(g) The prophet represents here the person and charge of them that are justly called to the ministry by God's word.<p>(h) To him that is oppressed by affliction and misery.<p>(i) As they who are taught, and made meet by him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4, 5</span>. The relation of the Servant to Jehovah is that of a favourite disciple to his master; from Him he had learned the art of persuasive and consoling speech, and to Him he daily looks for the substance of his message. Comp. <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a> (the Servant’s endowment with prophetic eloquence), and <a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment to truth.">Isaiah 42:3</a> (the gentleness of his ministry).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the tongue of the learned</span>] <span class="bld">a disciples’ tongue</span> (see ch. <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm" title="Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.">Isaiah 8:16</a>), i.e. a disciplined tongue (R.V. “of them that are taught”). The stress laid on the Divine education of the Servant is connected with the fact that his ministry of consolation was almost a new departure in prophecy. In the hands of the earlier prophets the word of Jehovah had been like a hammer breaking the rock in pieces (<a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm" title="Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?">Jeremiah 23:29</a>) rather than a dew reviving the spirit of the humble.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> I <span class="ital">should know … weary</span>] A difficult clause. The verb rendered “speak in season” (<span class="ital">‘ûth</span>) is unknown in Hebrew. The A.V., following the Jewish interpreters, takes it to be a denominative from the word for “time” (<span class="ital">‘çth</span>), but that is an impossible etymology. The LXX. gives a similar sense (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ γνῶναι ἡνίκα δεῖ εἰπεῖν λόγον</span>) but based on a different text. Of the traditional interpretations the most suitable is perhaps that of the Vulg. and Aquila (which is followed by the R.V.): <span class="bld">that I should know how to sustain the weary with a word</span>. Modern authorities who adopt this rendering support it by an Arabic verb meaning “to help,” which however is not an exact philological equivalent. Another Arabic analogy has suggested the translation “water” (i.e. “refresh”). It is impossible to get beyond conjecture, although the general sense is clear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he wakeneth</span> (sc. my ear) <span class="ital">morning by morning</span>] (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-19.htm" title="From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.">Isaiah 28:19</a>). A far simpler sentence results if we omit with Cheyne the first word of the Heb. (or with Duhm the first two words) as an uncorrected slip of a copyist, reading the adverbial expression with the following verb; thus: “morning by morning (or “in the morning”) he wakeneth my ear to hear” &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as the learned</span>] <span class="bld">after the manner of disciples</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned....">Isaiah 50:4-11</a><span class="bld">.</span> The Lord’s Servant made perfect through Sufferings<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned....">Isaiah 50:4-9</a></span> the Servant is again introduced, speaking of himself and his work, as in <a href="/context/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name....">Isaiah 49:1-6</a>. He describes in the first place the close and intimate and continuous communion with God through which he has learned the ministry of comfort by the Divine word, and his own complete self-surrender to the voice that guides him (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned....">Isaiah 50:4-5</a></span>); next, his acceptance of the persecution and obloquy which he had to encounter in the discharge of his commission (6); and lastly he expresses his unwavering confidence in the help of Jehovah and the victory of his righteous cause and the discomfiture of all his enemies (7–9).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/isaiah/50-10.htm" title="Who is among you that fears the LORD, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay on his God...."><span class="ital">Isaiah 50:10-11</a></span> are an appendix to the preceding description, drawing lessons for the encouragement of believers (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/50-10.htm" title="Who is among you that fears the LORD, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay on his God.">Isaiah 50:10</a></span>) and the warning of unbelievers (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/50-11.htm" title="Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled. This shall you have of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.">Isaiah 50:11</a></span>). They contain expressions and even thoughts which are unlike those of the second Isaiah; and are possibly (with Duhm and Cheyne) to be regarded as a later insertion in the prophecy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Although the word “Servant” never occurs in this passage, its resemblance to the three other “servant-passages” makes it certain that the speaker is none other than the ideal character who comes before us in <a href="/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles....">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name....">Isaiah 49:1-6</a>, and Isa 52:13–53:15. The passage, indeed, forms an almost indispensable link of connexion between the first two and the last of these. Whilst it takes up and developes certain ideas thrown out in the earlier sections, and in its dramatic form most resembles the second of them, its closest affinities are with <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> ff. Common to both is the new conception of the Servant as a <span class="ital">sufferer</span>, here at the hands of men, there at the hands of men and God alike. In the present passage we have the Servant’s own consciousness with regard to his sufferings, these being regarded from an ethical point of view as brought on him by fidelity to his Divine mission. In ch. <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> ff. it is the religious aspect of them that is mainly dwelt upon: their value in the sight of God, and their efficacy for the salvation of men.—The view, therefore, that the prophet here speaks in his own name cannot be maintained, although it is no doubt the one that would be most readily suggested if the verses stood alone. So also the further question whether the Servant be the ideal Israel must be considered with due regard to the other places where the same idea is presented (see Appendix, Note I). Here it is only necessary to observe that the conception cannot in any case be applied to Israel as a whole and its sufferings from other nations. We have seen from ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth....">Isaiah 49:6-7</a> that the Servant has two spheres of activity, one within Israel, and the other directed to the world at large; and there can be no reasonable doubt that the persecutions referred to belong to the narrower sphere, representing the experience of the godly minority in whom the true ideal of Israel was partly realised, in conflict with their unregenerate fellow-countrymen.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - A SOLILOQUY OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH. The separateness of this passage has been maintained in the opening paragraph. That it is not of himself that the prophet here speaks, appears <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the self-assertion (vers, 4, 5, 9); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the depth of humiliation declared in ver. 6, which is beyond anything recorded of Isaiah. But if he does not speak of himself, he can scarcely speak of any other besides "the Servant," of whom he has already said much (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), and of whom he has still much more to say (<a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the tongue of disciples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a trained tongue, a well-taught tongue.

At no time did the Father "leave him alone" (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>) or cease to speak to him.

The question, <a href="/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a> : "Can the booty indeed be wrested from a giant, or will the captive host of the righteous escape?" The question is logically one, and only divided rhetorically into two (Ges. 153, 2). The giant, or gigantically strong one, is the Chaldean. Knobel, in opposition to Hitzig, who supposes the Persian to be referred to, points very properly to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12-13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>. He is mistaken, however, in thinking that we must read &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>, as Ewald does after the Syriac and Jerome, on account of the parallelism. The exiles are called shebh&#305;&#772; tsadd&#305;&#772;q, not, however, as captives wrested from the righteous (the congregation of the righteous), as Meier thinks, taking tsadd&#305;&#772;q as the gen. obj.; still less as captives carried off by the righteous one, i.e., the Chaldean, for the Chaldean, even regarded as the accomplisher of the righteous judgment of God, is not tsadd&#305;&#772;q, but "wicked" (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>); but merely as a host of captives consisting of righteous men (Hitzig). The divine answer, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a> : "Yea, thus saith Jehovah, Even the captive hosts of a giant are wrested from him, and the booty of a tyrant escapes: and I will make war upon him that warreth with thee, and I will bring salvation to thy children. And I feed them that pain thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as if with new wine; and all flesh sees that I Jehovah am thy Saviour, and that thy Redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob." We might take the k&#305;&#772; in <a href="/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a> as a simple affirmative, but it is really to be taken as preceded by a tacit intermediate thought. Rosenmller's explanation is the correct one: "that which is hardly credible shall take place, for thus hath Jehovah said." He has also given the true interpretation of gam: "although this really seems incredible, yet I will give it effect." Ewald, on the contrary, has quite missed the sense of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, which he gives as follows: "The booty in men which a hero has taken in war, may indeed be taken from him again; but Jehovah will never let the booty that He takes from the Chaldean (viz., Israel) be wrested from Him again." This is inadmissible, for the simple reason that it presupposes the emendation &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; noita; and this 'a&#770;r&#305;&#772;ts is quite unsuitable, partly because it would be Jehovah to whom the case supposed referred, and still more, because the correspondence in character between <a href="/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a> is thereby destroyed. The gibbo&#772;r and 'a&#770;r&#305;&#772;ts is called &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, with direct reference to Zion. This is a noun formed from the future, like Jareb in <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and <a href="/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a> - a name chosen as the distinctive epithet of the Asiatic emperor (probably a name signifying "king Fighting-cock"). The self-laceration threatened against the Chaldean empire recals to mind <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-19.htm">Isaiah 9:19-20</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/11-9.htm">Zechariah 11:9</a>, and has as revolting a sound as <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a> -passages which Daumer and Ghillany understand in the cannibal sense which they appear to have, whereas what they understand literally is merely a hyperbolical figure. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the Old Testament church was a nation, and that the spirit of revelation in the Old Testament assumed the national form, which it afterwards shattered to pieces. Knobel points to the revolt of the Hyrcanians and several satraps, who fought on the side of Cyrus against their former rulers (Cyrop. iv 2, 6, v. 1-3). All this will be subservient to that salvation and redemption, which form the historical aim of Jehovah and the irresistible work of the Mighty One of Jacob. The name of God which we meet with here, viz., the Mighty One of Jacob, only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, and shows who is the author of the prophecy which is concluded here. The first half set forth, in the servant of Jehovah, the mediator of Israel's restoration and of the conversion of the heathen, and closed with an appeal to the heaven and the earth to rejoice with the ransomed church. The second half (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-26</a>) rebukes the despondency of Zion, which fancies itself forgotten of Jehovah, by pointing to Jehovah's more than maternal love, and the superabundant blessing to be expected from Him. It also rebukes the doubts of Zion as to the possibility of such a redemption, by pointing to the faithfulness and omnipotence of the God of Israel, who will cause the exiles to be wrested from the Chaldean, and their tormentors to devour one another. The following chapter commences a fresh train of ideas. </body></html>
