The parallelism, in any case, is so clear as to make it certain that the two were contemporary, and refer to the same events. The same may be said, perhaps, of all the psalms of the sons of Korah.

Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, cities then secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria. The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in that land in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve it in the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mild government, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror and tyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey, stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, will find that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemy shall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of his heavenly inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall ... - That is, the Assyrians - though still retaining the idea of an overflowing stream, or a deluge of waters.<p>Reach even to the neck - Chaldee, 'They shall come even to Jerusalem.' 'The prophet compares Jerusalem here,' says Kimchi, 'to the head of the human body. As when the waters reach to the neck of a man, he is very near drowning, so here, the prophet intimates that the whole land would be deluged, and that it would be nearly utterly destroyed.' The figure thus understood is a very sublime one Jerusalem was situated on hills - elevated above the surrounding country, and, in reference to the whole land, might be aptly compared to the human head. Thus, Josephus (De Bello, lib. iii. ch. ii.), describing Jerusalem, says - &#x399;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Hierosoluma proanischousa te&#772;s perioikou pase&#772;s, ho&#772;sper he&#772; kephale&#772; so&#772;matos - "Jerusalem, eminent above all the surrounding region, as the head of the body." The country is represented as being laid under water - a vast sea of rolling and tumultuous waves - with Jerusalem alone rising above them, standing in solitary grandeur amidst the heaving ocean, and itself in danger each moment of being ingulphed; see a similar figure, <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a> :<p>He is spirit is like a torrent overflowing<p>It shall reach to the middle of the neck.<p>And so also, <a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a> :<p>Thou didst go forth for the salvation of thy people,<p>For the salvation of thine anointed:<p>Thou didst smite the head from the house of the wicked,<p>Destroying the foundation even to the neck.<p>And the stretching out of his wings - This is a continuation of the same idea under a new figure. The term wings is often applied to an army, as well in modern as in ancient writings. It denotes that the invading army would be so vast as, when expanded or drawn out, to fill the land.<p>Shall fill the breadth - Shall occupy the entire land, so that there shall be no city or town which he shall not invade.<p>Thy land, O Immanuel - see the note at <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. If this be understood as referring to the son of Isaiah that was to be born, then it means that the child was given as a pledge that the land would be safe from the threatened invasion. It was natural, therefore, to address the child in that manner; as reminding the prophet that this land, which was about to be invaded, belonged to God, and was yet under his protection. Its meaning may be thus paraphrased: 'O thou who art a pledge of the protection of God - whose birth is an assurance that the land is under his care, and who art given as such a sign to the nation. Notwithstanding this pledge, the land shall be full of foes. They shall spread through every part and endanger all.' Yet the name, the circumstances of the birth, the promise at that time, would all remind the prophet and the king, that, notwithstanding this, the land would be still under the protection of God. If the language be understood as referring to the future Messiah, and as an address made to him then, by calling the land his land, it is intimated that it could not be brought to utter desolation, nor could the country where he was to be born remain wasted and ruined. It would be indeed invaded; the armies of the Assyrian would spread over it, but still it was the land of Immanuel; and was to be the place of his birth, and it was to be secure until the time should arrive for him to come. The probability is, I think, that the address is here solely to the Messiah; and that the purpose of God is to fix the mind of the prophet on the fact that the Messiah must come, as an assurance that the land could not be wholly and perpetually desolate; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. pass through&#8212;The flood shall not stop at Syria and Samaria, but shall penetrate into Judea.<p>the neck&#8212;When the waters reach to the neck, a man is near drowning; still the head is not said to be overflowed.

This prophecy was fulfilled, since it was not Assyria, but Babylon, which destroyed the Jewish kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land.</span> The Assyrian armies shall visit every part of the land. The sudden change of metaphor is in the manner of Isaiah (see <a href="/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30, 31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">O Immanuel</span>. On the importance of this address, as indicating the kingly, and so (probably) the Divine character of Immanuel, see the notes on Isaiah 7:14. Isaiah could not speak of the land as belonging to his own infant son. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the midst of the Syro-Ephraimitish war, which was not yet at an end, Isaiah received instructions from God to perform a singular prophetic action. "Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large slab, and write upon it with common strokes, 'In Speed Spoil, Booty hastens;' and I will take to me trustworthy witnesses, Uriyah the priest, and Zecharyahu the son of Yeberechyahu." The slab or table (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-23.htm">Isaiah 3:23</a>, where the same word is used to signify a metal mirror) was to be large, to produce the impression of a monument; and the writing upon it was to be "a man's pen" (Cheret 'eno&#772;sh), i.e., written in the vulgar, and, so to speak, popular character, consisting of inartistic strokes that could be easily read (vid., <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-17.htm">Revelation 21:17</a>). Philip d'Aquin, in his Lexicon, adopts the explanation, "Enosh-writing, i.e., hieroglyphic writing, so called because it was first introduced in the time of Enosh." Luzzatto renders it, a lettere cubitali; but the reading for this would be b'cheret ammath 'ish. The only true rendering is stylo vulgari (see Ges. Thes. s.v. 'enosh). The words to be written are introduced with Lamed, to indicate dedication (as in <a href="/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>), or the object to which the inscription was dedicated or applied, as if it read, "A table devoted to 'Spoil very quickly, booty hastens;' " unless, indeed, l'mahe&#772;r is to be taken as a fut. instans, as it is by Luzzatto - after <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-5.htm">Joshua 2:5</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> - in the sense of acceleratura sunt spolia, or (what the position of the words might more naturally suggest) with mahe&#772;r in a transitive sense, as in the construction &#1500;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;&#1468; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, and others, accelerationi spolia, i.e., they are ready for hastening. Most of the commentators have confused the matter here by taking the words as a proper name (Ewald, 288, c), which they were not at first, though they became so afterwards. At first they were an oracular announcement of the immediate future, accelerant spolia, festinat praeda (spoil is quick, booty hastens). Spoil; booty; but who would the vanquished be? Jehovah knew, and His prophet knew, although not initiated into the policy of Ahaz. But their knowledge was studiously veiled in enigmas. For the writing was not to disclose anything to the people. It was simply to serve as a public record of the fact, that the course of events was one that Jehovah had foreseen and indicated beforehand. And when what was written upon the table should afterwards take place, they would know that it was the fulfilment of what had already been written, and therefore was an event pre-determined by God. For this reason Jehovah took to Himself witnesses. There is no necessity to read &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; (and I had it witnessed), as Knobel and others do; nor &#1493;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; (and have it witnessed), as the Sept., Targum, Syriac, and Hitzig do. Jehovah said what He would do; and the prophet knew, without requiring to be told, that it was to be accomplished instrumentally through him. Uriah was no doubt the priest (Urijah), who afterwards placed himself at the service of Ahaz to gratify his heathenish desires (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>.). Zechariah ben Yeberechyahu (Berechiah) was of course not the prophet of the times after the captivity, but possibly the Asaphite mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/29-13.htm">2 Chronicles 29:13</a>. He is not further known to us. In good editions, ben is not followed by makkeph, but marked with mercha, according to the Masora at <a href="/genesis/30-19.htm">Genesis 30:19</a>. These two men were reliable witnesses, being persons of great distinction, and their testimony would weigh with the people. When the time should arrive that the history of their own times solved the riddle of this inscription, these two men were to tell the people how long ago the prophet had written that down in his prophetic capacity. </body></html>
