Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they shall say - When the people, instead of putting confidence in God, shall propose to apply to necromancers. In the time of Ahaz the people were, as they were often, much inclined to idolatry; <a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>. In their troubles and embarrassments, instead of looking to Yahweh, they imitated the example of surrounding nations, and applied for relief to those who professed to be able to hold converse with spirits. That it was common for idolatrous people to seek direction from those who professed that they had the power of divining, is well known; see <a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>. It was expressly forbidden to the Jews to have recourse to those who made such professions; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>. Yet, notwithstanding this express command, it is evident that it was no uncommon thing for the Jews to make application for such instructions; see the case of Saul, who made application to the woman of Endor, who professed to have a familiar spirit, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-25</a>. Among pagan nations, nothing was more common than for persons to profess to have contact with spirits, and to be under the influence of their inspiration. The oracle at Delphi, of this nature, was celebrated throughout Greece, and throughout the world. Kings and princes, warriors and nations, sought of the priestess who presided there, responses in undertaking any important enterprise, and were guided by her instructions; see the Travels of Anacharsis, vol. ii.376ff.<p>Seek unto - Apply to for direction.<p>That hath familiar spirits - Hebrew, &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;  'obo&#770;th. The word 'familiar,' applied to spirit, is supposed to have been used by our translators to imply that they were attended by an invisible spirit that was subject to their call, or that would inspire them when they sought his direction. The Hebrew word is used to denote a necromancer, a conjuror; particularly one who was supposed to have power to call up the dead, to learn Of them respecting future events; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>. The word is most commonly applied to women; as it was almost entirely confined to women to profess this power; <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28.htm">1 Samuel 28</a>. The idea was, that they could call up the spirits of the dead who were supposed to have seen objects invisible to the living, and who could, therefore, inform them in regard to things which mortals on earth could not see. The Vulgate renders this by 'Pythons and diviners.' A Python, among the Greeks and Romans, denoted one that had the spirit of prophesying, and was particularly applied to the priestess of Apollo at Delphi. The Septuagint renders the place thus: 'And if they say to you, Seek the "ventriloquists," &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  engastrimuthous, and those speaking from the earth, and speaking vain things, who speak from the belly,' &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  hoi ek te&#772;s koilias pho&#772;nousin. From this it is evident, that the art of the ventriloquist, so well known now, was known then; and it is highly probable that the secret of the art of soothsayers consisted very much in being able to throw the voice, with various modifications, into different places, so that it would seem to come from a grave, or from an image of a dead person, that was made to appear at the proper time.<p>And unto wizards - The word used here - &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  yidde&#8219;o&#770;n&#305;&#770;ym - is derived from the verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;  ya&#770;da&#8219; to know; and means a wise man, a soothsayer, a magician, or one possessed with a spirit of divination. The arts of the magician, or soothsayer, were often the arts of one skilled in natural magic; acquainted somewhat with the laws of chemistry; and able, therefore, to produce appearances among an ignorant people that would surprise them; see Brewster's Natural Magic, where this art is fully explained.<p>That peep - This word is properly used of young birds, and means to chirp, to pip; and also to make a small noise by the gentle opening of the mouth. It is then applied to the gentle whispering which the ancients ascribed to departed spirits; the small, low, shrill voice which they were supposed to use, and which, probably, those attempted to imitate who claimed the power of raising them to the earth. It was believed among all the ancient nations, that departed spirits did not speak out openly and clearly, but with an indistinct, low, gentle, suppressed voice. Thus, in Virgil:<p> - Pars tollere vocem<p>Exiguam.<p>AEneid, vi. 492.<p> - gemitus lachrymabilis imo<p>Auditur tumulo, et vox reddita ferter ad aures.<p>AEneid, iii.39.<p>Thus Horace:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Seek unto&#8212;Consult in your national difficulties.<p>them &#8230; familiar spirits&#8212;necromancers, spirit charmers. So Saul, when he had forsaken God (1Sa 28:7, &c.), consulted the witch of En-dor in his difficulties. These follow in the wake of idolatry, which prevailed under Ahaz (2Ki 16:3, 4, 10). He copied the soothsaying as he did the idolatrous "altar" of Damascus (compare Le 20:6, which forbids it, Isa 19:3).<p>wizards&#8212;men claiming supernatural knowledge; from the old English, "to wit," that is, know.<p>peep&#8212;rather "chirp faintly," as young birds do; this sound was generally ascribed to departed spirits; by ventriloquism the soothsayers caused a low sound to proceed as from a grave, or dead person. Hence the Septuagint renders the Hebrew for "necromancers" here "ventriloquists" (compare Isa 29:4).<p>mutter&#8212;moan.<p>should not, &c.&#8212;The answer which Isaiah recommends to be given to those advising to have recourse to necromancers.<p>for the living, &c.&#8212;"should one, for the safety of the living, seek unto (consult) the dead?"

So Saul in the Philistine war resorted to the witch of Endor (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-20</a>); Manasseh, threatened by Esar-haddon, "used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards" (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Israel generally, oppressed by Syria and Assyria, "used divination and enchantments" (<a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>). There was the same inclination now on the part of many Jews. The vexed question of the actual powers possessed by such persons cannot be discussed within the limits of a footnote. It has, moreover, already been treated in the present Commentary, in connection with <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wizards that peep, and that mutter</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that chirp and mutter</span>. Tricks of the ventriloquists, probably, who disguised their voices, and represented that they were the voices of ghosts (comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). The natural speech of some tribes has been compared to the "chirping of birds" (Herod., 4:183; Hornemann, 'Travels,' p. 119). <span class="cmt_word">Should not a people</span>, etc.? Very abrupt and elliptical Isaiah means to say, "Do not attend to them; but answer, Should not a people," etc.? <span class="cmt_word">For the living</span>. This may either mean "<span class="accented">instead of the</span> living," or "on behalf of the living seek to the dead?" or, Would not that be plainly preposterous? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The object of their fear was a very different one. "Jehovah of hosts, sanctify Him; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your terror. So will He become a sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence (vexation) to both the houses of Israel, a snare and trap to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and shall fall; and be dashed to pieces, and be snared and taken." The logical apodosis to <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a> commences with v'ha&#770;ha&#770;h (so shall He be). If ye actually acknowledge Jehovah the Holy One as the Holy One (hikd&#305;&#772;sh, as in <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>), and if it is He whom ye fear, and who fills you with dread (ma&#8219;ar&#305;&#772;tz, used for the object of dread, as mo&#772;rah is for the object of fear; hence "that which terrifies" in a causative sense), He will become a mikda&#770;sh. The word mikda&#770;sh may indeed denote the object sanctified, and so Knobel understands it here according to <a href="/numbers/18-29.htm">Numbers 18:29</a>; but if we adhere to the strict notion of the word, this gives an unmeaning apodosis. Mikda&#770;sh generally means the sanctified place or sanctuary, with which the idea of an asylum would easily associate itself, since even among the Israelites the temple was regarded and respected as an asylum (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>). This is the explanation which most of the commentators have adopted here; and the punctuators also took it in the same sense, when they divided the two halves of <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> by athnach as antithetical. And mikda&#770;sh is really to be taken in this sense, although it cannot be exactly rendered "asylum," since this would improperly limit the meaning of the word. The temple was not only a place of shelter, but also of grace, blessing, and peace. All who sanctified the Lord of lords He surrounded like temple walls; hid them in Himself, whilst death and tribulation reigned without, and comforted, fed, and blessed them in His own gracious fellowship. This is the true explanation of v'ha&#770;ya&#770;h l'mikda&#770;s, according to such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>. To the two houses of Israel, on the contrary, i.e., to the great mass of the people of both kingdoms who neither sanctified nor feared Jehovah, He would be a rock and snare. The synonyms are intentionally heaped together (cf., <a href="/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a>), to produce the fearful impression of death occurring in many forms, but all inevitable. The first three verbs of <a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a> refer to the "stone" ('eben) and "rock" (tzu&#772;r); the last two to the "snare" (pach), and "trap" or springe (mo&#772;ke&#772;sh).<p>(Note: Malbim observes quite correctly, that "the pach catches, but does not hurt; the mokesh catches and hurts (e.g., by seizing the legs or nose, <a href="/job/40-24.htm">Job 40:24</a>): the former is a simple snare (or net), the latter a springe, or snare which catches by means of a spring" (<a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>).)<p>All who did not give glory to Jehovah would be dashed to pieces upon His work as upon a stone, and caught therein as in a trap. This was the burden of the divine warning, which the prophet heard for himself and for those that believed. </body></html>
