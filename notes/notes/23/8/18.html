Each was a <span class= "ital">nomen et omen </span>for those who had ears to hear. Could the disciples of Isaiah complain that they had no light thrown upon the future, when, so to say, they had those embodied prophecies? The children disappear from the scene, and we know nothing of their after-history, but all their life long, even with or without a special prophetic work, they must have been, by virtue of their names, witnesses to a later generation, of what Isaiah had predicted. In Isaiah’s own life, as including symbolic acts as well as prophetic words (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>), we have a further development of the thought that he was “a sign and a wonder.” (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/12-11.htm" title="Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove and go into captivity.">Ezekiel 12:11</a>.) The citation of the words, “I and the children whom thou hast given me,” in <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm" title="And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.">Hebrews 2:13</a>, is noticeable here chiefly as showing how little the writer of that Epistle cared in this and other quotations for the original meaning of the words as determined by the context. It was enough for him that the Christ, like the prophet, did not stand alone, but claimed a fellowship with the children whom the Father had given him (<a href="/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6</a>; <a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>), as being alike servants and children of God, called to do His will.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; but he would look for his return in favour to them again. Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I... - By 'signs and wonders,' here, it is meant that they, by the names given them, were intended to teach important lessons to the Jewish people. Their names were significant, and were designed to illustrate some important truth; and especially the prophet here intimates that they were to inculcate the truth in regard to the presence and protection of God, to induce the people to look to him. Thus the name immanuel, 'God with us,' <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; and Shear-jashub, 'the remnant shall return,' <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>, were both significant of the fact that none but God could be the protector of the nation. And in like manner, it is possible that his own name, signifying the salvation of Jehovah, had been given him with such a reference. But at all events, it was a name which would remind them of the truth that he was now inculcating, that salvation was to be found in Yahweh, and that they should look to him. Names of children were often thus emblematic (see <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a>); and the prophets themselves were regarded as signs of important events; <a href="/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>; compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>. This passage is quoted with reference to the Messiah in <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>.<p>Which dwelleth in mount Zion - Mount Zion was the residence of the house of David, or of the court, and it was often used to signify Jerusalem itself.

I and the children&#8212;Isaiah means "salvation of Jehovah"; His children's names, also (Isa 7:3, 14; 8:3), were "signs" suggestive of the coming and final deliverance.<p>wonders&#8212;that is, symbols of the future (Isa 20:3; Zec 3:8). "Behold I &#8230; me" is quoted in Heb 2:13 to prove the manhood of the Messiah. This is the main and ultimate fulfilment of the prophecy; its temporary meaning is applied to Ahaz' time. Isaiah typically, in Isa 8:17, 18, personates Messiah, who is at once "Father" and "Son," Isaiah and Immanuel, "Child" and "Mighty God," and is therefore called here a "wonder," as in Isa 9:6, "Wonderful." Hence in Heb 2:13, believers are called His "children"; but in Isa 8:11, 12, His "brethren." On "the Lord hath given me," see Joh 6:37, 39; 10:29; 17:12.<p>which dwelleth in &#8230; Zion&#8212;and will therefore protect Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Behold; </span> it is worthy of your observation and admiration.

His own name, also, though not an uncommon one, expresses what we may regard as the most comprehensive idea of his theology—“Jehovah saves.” He and they are thus <span class="bld">for signs and portents</span> (cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;">Isaiah 20:3</a> and see on <a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm" title="Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.">Isaiah 7:11</a>) in Israel; the children especially cannot be seen or named without recalling to mind prophetic utterances of profound import.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which dwelleth in mount Zion</span>] This conception seems to have first emerged in Isaiah’s teaching at the time of the Syro-Ephraimite war, when Jerusalem was threatened by a foreign army. We have here perhaps the earliest anticipation of what became afterwards a fixed element of his prophecy—the inviolability of Jerusalem, the earthly seat of Jehovah’s throne.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I and the children... are for signs.</span> Isaiah's children seem to have been "for signs," especially in respect of their names. Shear-Jashub meant "A remnant shall return" (<a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>), and thus held out two hopes; one that a remnant of Israel would return to God and become his true servants, another that a remnant would return from the captivity that had been prophesied (<a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). Maher-shalal-hash-baz - "Plunder speeds, spoil hastens" - was a "sign" of a different kind. Primarily, his name referred to the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria (vers. 3, 4); but it may further have indicated a time of general disturbance, plunder, and ravage. It is not quite clear in what respects Isaiah was a "sign." Perhaps he, too, in his name, which meant "(Our) salvation is Jehovah" - certainly also in his symbolical acts (<a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>), and possibly in the firmness of his faith, which never wavered. <span class="cmt_word">From the Lord of hosts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from by the Lord of hosts -</span> an expression like the French <span class="accented">de chez</span>. God had supernaturally appointed the sign in one case (vers. 1-4), but in the other two had merely brought them about by the secret working of his providence. But the prophet treats all three as coming equally from him. <span class="cmt_word">Which dwelleth in Mount Zion</span>. Hero, again, is encouragement. God has not quitted Zion. The Shechinah still rests between the cherubim in the holy of holies. While this is so, God is still <span class="accented">with</span> his people (Immanuel). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There then follows in <a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a> an explanatory clause, which seems at first sight to pass on to a totally different theme, but it really stands in the closest connection with the triumphant words of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>. It is Immanuel whom believers receive, constitute, and hold fast as their refuge in the approaching times of the Assyrian judgment. He is their refuge and God in Him, and not any human support whatever. This is the link of connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12</a> : "For Jehovah hath spoken thus to me, overpowering me with God's hand, and instructing me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, Call ye not conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy; and what is feared by it, fear ye not, neither think ye dreadful." &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, "the hand," is the absolute hand, which is no sooner laid upon a man than it overpowers all perception, sensation, and though: Chezkath hayya&#770;d (viz., a&#770;lai, upon me, <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>) therefore describes a condition in which the hand of God was put forth upon the prophet with peculiar force, as distinguished from the more usual prophetic state, the effect of a peculiarly impressive and energetic act of God. Luther is wrong in following the Syriac, and adopting the rendering, "taking me by the hand;" as Chezkath points back to the kal (invalescere), and not to the hiphil (apprehendere). It is this circumstantial statement, which is continued in v'yissereni ("and instructing me"), and not the leading verb a&#770;mar ("he said"); for the former is not the third pers. pret. piel, which would be v'yisserani, but the third pers. fut. kal, from the future form yisso&#772;r (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-10.htm">Hosea 10:10</a>, whereas the fut. piel is v'yasse&#772;r); and it is closely connected with Chezkath hayya&#770;d, according to the analogy of the change from the participial and infinitive construction to the finite verb (Ges. 132, Anm. 2). With this overpowering influence, and an instructive warning against going in the way of "this people," Jehovah spake to the prophet as follows. With regard to the substance of the following warning, the explanation that has been commonly adopted since the time of Jerome, viz., noli duorum regum timere conjurationem (fear not the conspiracy of the two kings), is contrary to the reading of the words. The warning runs thus: The prophet, and such as were on his side, were not to call that kesher which the great mass of the people called kesher (cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-13.htm">2 Chronicles 23:13</a>, "She said, Treason, Treason!" kesher, kesher); yet the alliance of Rezin and Pekah was really a conspiracy - a league against the house and people of David. Nor can the warning mean that believers, when they saw how the unbelieving Ahaz brought the nation into distress, were not to join in a conspiracy against the person of the king (Hofmann, Drechsler); they are not warned at all against making a conspiracy, but against joining in the popular cry when the people called out kesher. The true explanation has been given by Roorda, viz., that the reference is to the conspiracy, as it was called, of the prophet and his disciples ("sermo hic est de conjuratione, quae dicebatur prophetae et discipulorum ejus"). The same thing happened to Isaiah as to Amos (<a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>) and to Jeremiah. Whenever the prophets were at all zealous in their opposition to the appeal for foreign aid, they were accused and branded as standing in the service of the enemy, and conspiring for the overthrow of the kingdom. In such perversion of language as this, the honourable among them were not to join. The way of God was now a very different one from the way of that people. If the prophet and his followers opposed the alliance with Asshur, this was not a common human conspiracy against the will of the king and nation, but the inspiration of God, the true policy of Jehovah. Whoever trusted in Him had no need to be afraid of such attempts as those of Rezin and Pekah, or to look upon them as dreadful. </body></html>
