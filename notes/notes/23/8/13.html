And that such a place and people should reject Immanuel, when he should appear, was so strange an occurrence, that the prediction of it was highly necessary, lest otherwise, when it came to pass, it should shake the faith of all who did believe on him; whereas, now the accomplishment hereof was a notable confirmation of their faith. <span class="ital">And many among them </span>— Not all; for there shall be a remnant, as was foretold, <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <span class="ital">shall stumble </span>— At that stone or rock, mentioned <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>.

Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sanctify ... - Regard Yahweh as holy; that is, worship and honor him with pious fear and reverence.

They who feared Rezin and Pekah, despite of God's assurances that their design should fail, did not believe in him, and so did not "sanctify" him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The heading or introduction, "And Jehovah proceeded still further to speak to me, as follows," extends to all the following addresses as far as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>. They all finish with consolation. But consolation presupposes the need of consolation. Consequently, even in this instance the prophet is obliged to commence with a threatening of judgment. "Forasmuch as this people despiseth the waters of Siloah that go softly, and regardeth as a delight the alliance with Rezin and the son of Remalyahu, therefore, behold! the Lord of all bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, the mighty and the great, the king of Asshur and all his military power; and he riseth over all his channels, and goeth over all his banks." The Siloah had its name (Shiloach, or, according to the reading of this passage contained in very good MSS, Shilloach), ab emittendo, either in an infinitive sense, "shooting forth," or in a participial sense, with a passive colouring, emissus, sent forth, spirted out (vid., <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>; and on the variations in meaning of this substantive form, Concord. p. 1349, s.). Josephus places the fountain and pool of Siloah at the opening of the Tyropoeon, on the south-eastern side of the ancient city, where we still find it at the present day (vid., Jos. Wars of the Jews, v. 4, 1; also Robinson, Pal. i. 504). The clear little brook - a pleasant sight to the eye as it issues from the ravine which runs between the south-western slope of Moriah and the south-eastern slope of Mount Zion<p>(Note: It is with perfect propriety, therefore, that Jerome sometimes speaks in the fons Siloe as flowing ad radices Montis Zion, and at other times as flowing in radicibus Montis Moria.)<p>(V. Schulbert, Reise, ii. 573) - is used here as a symbol of the Davidic monarchy enthroned upon Zion, which had the promise of God, who was enthroned upon Moriah, in contrast with the imperial or world kingdom, which is compared to the overflowing waters of the Euphrates. The reproach of despising the waters of Siloah applied to Judah as well as Ephraim: to the former because it trusted in Asshur, and despised the less tangible but more certain help which the house of David, if it were but believing, had to expect from the God of promise; to the latter, because it had entered into alliance with Aram to overthrow the house of David; and yet the house of David, although degenerate and deformed, was the divinely appointed source of that salvation, which is ever realized through quiet, secret ways. The second reproach applied more especially to Ephraim. The 'eth is not to be taken as the sign of the accusative, for su&#772;s never occurs with the accusative of the object (not even in <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>), and could not well be so used. It is to be construed as a preposition in the sense of "and (or because) delight (is felt) with (i.e., in) the alliance with Rezin and Pekah." (On the constructive before a preposition, see Ges. 116, 1: su&#772;s 'e&#772;th, like ra&#770;tza&#770;h &#8219;im.) Luzzatto compares, for the construction, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>, v'na&#770;tho&#772;n; but only the inf. abs. is used in this way as a continuation of the finite verb (see Ges. 131, 4, a). Moreover, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474; is not an Aramaic infinitive, but a substantive used in such a way as to retain the power of the verb (like &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>, and &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>, unless, indeed, the reading here should be &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1502;&#1497;). The substantive clause is preferred to the verbal clause &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;, for the sake of the antithetical consonance of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1505; with &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;. It is also quite in accordance with Hebrew syntax, that an address which commences with &#1499;&#1497; &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; should here lose itself in the second sentence "in the twilight," as Ewald expresses it (351, c), of a substantive clause. Knobel and others suppose the reproof to relate to dissatisfied Judaeans, who were secretly favourable to the enterprise of the two allied kings. But there is no further evidence that there were such persons; and <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> is opposed to this interpretation. The overflowing of the Assyrian forces would fall first of all upon Ephraim. The threat of punishment is introduced with &#1493;&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, the Vav being the sign of sequence (Ewald, 348, b). The words "the king of Asshur" are the prophet's own gloss, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>. </body></html>
