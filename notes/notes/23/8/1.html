In the meantime much that had happened seemed to cast discredit on the prophet’s words. The child that was the type of the greater Immanuel had been born, but there were no signs as yet of the downfall of the northern kingdom. The attack of Rezin and Pekah, though Jerusalem had not been taken, had inflicted an almost irreparable blow on the kingdom of Judah. Multitudes had been carried captive to Damascus (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.">2Chronicles 28:5</a>). Many thousands, but for the intercession of the prophet Oded, would have eaten the bread of exile and slavery. The Edomites were harassing the south-eastern frontier (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-15.htm" title="And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.">2Chronicles 28:15-17</a>). The commerce of the Red Sea was cut off by Rezin’s capture of Elath (<a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2Kings 16:6</a>). To the weak and faithless Ahaz and his counsellors, it might well seem that the prospect was darker than ever, that there was no hope but in the protection of Assyria. If such was the state of things when the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, was he to recant and confess that he had erred? Was he to shrink back into silence and obscurity? Far otherwise than that. He was to repeat all that he had said, more definitely, more demonstratively than ever.<p><span class= "bld">Take thee a great roll . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">a</span> <span class= "ital">large tablet. </span>The noun is the same as that used for “mirrors” or “glasses” in <a href="/isaiah/3-23.htm" title="The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.">Isaiah 3:23</a>. The writings of the prophet were commonly written on papyrus and placed in the hands of his disciples to be read aloud. For private and less permanent messages men used small wooden tablets smeared with wax, on which they wrote with an iron stylus. (Comp. <a href="/job/19-24.htm" title="That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!">Job 19:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm" title="Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:">Isaiah 30:8</a>.)

That mysterious name, which we may render “<span class= "ital">Speed-plunder, haste-spoil,</span>” was, for at least nine months, to be the enigma of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, the Lord said unto me </span>— Here begins “the second section of this discourse, which reaches to the seventh verse of the next chapter, and is nearly of the same argument with the preceding; being prophetical, and containing matter both of comfort and reproof. It may be divided into two parts. The first part, in the first four verses, contains a confirmation and sign of the prediction concerning the sudden subversion of the kingdoms of Syria and Israel. The second part more fully and distinctly explains the purpose of God with respect both to the Israelites and Jews, for the consolation of the pious, and the terror of the impious and carnal, among them.” <span class="ital">Take thee a great roll </span>— Or, <span class="ital">a great volume, </span>because the prophecy to be written in it was large: and God would have it written in very large and legible characters; <span class="ital">and write in it with a man’s pen </span>— With such a pen as writers use, that so all may read and understand it.

Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, cities then secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria. The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in that land in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve it in the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mild government, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror and tyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey, stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, will find that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemy shall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of his heavenly inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take thee a great roll - The word which is here translated 'roll' more properly signifies tablet. So the Chaldee renders it. Those tablets were made of wood, metal, or stone, for the purpose of writing on; see <a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>. On these tablets, or smooth plates, writing was performed by cutting the letters with an iron stylus, or small chisel. The process was slow, but the writing was permanent. They sometimes used the skins of animals, or the bark of trees, and subsequently the papyrus of Egypt (compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm">Isaiah 19:7</a>); and it is possible that Isaiah may have used such a roll or volume on this occasion; compare <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>.<p>With a man's pen - The word "pen" here (&#1495;&#1512;&#1496;  cheret&#803;) denotes the iron stylus, which was used to engrave or cut the letters in the metal or wood. The phrase 'a man's pen,' has been variously interpreted. The Chaldee renders it, 'Write in it an open, or clear writing, or an expanded writing;' meaning that he should make it clear and distinct, so as to be easily read. The Syriac, 'Write on it in the (usual) custom of men.' The word which is translated 'man's &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  'e&#774;no&#770;sh usually denotes common men, the lower ranks, in opposition to the higher ranks of society. And probably the direction means simply, 'write on it in letters such as men commonly use; in a plain, open, distinct manner - without using any mysterious emblems or characters, but so that men may read it distinctly and easily.' A parallel place occurs in <a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a> : 'Write the vision and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.'<p>Concerning - Hebrew &#1500;  (le). This preposition may denote concerning, of, or to. I understand it here as referring to the heading or title of the prophecy. This was to be set over the prophecy, as a running title, to denote the main subject of it. The subject is indicated in the name which is immediately added.<p>Maher - Hasten; or, he shall hasten. "Shalal." Spoil, or prey.<p>Hash - Hasten, or make speed.<p>Baz - Spoil, or prey. The name used here is a repetition of the same idea - denoting haste in seizing prey, or spoil; and is repeated to give emphasis, and to excite attention. The idea is, that the Assyrian would hasten to his plunder - that it would be accomplished with speed. This name was to be given to a child of Isaiah; and this child was to be a sign of the event which was signified by the name; see <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2-3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>Isa 8:1-9:7.<p>The first seven verses of the ninth chapter belong to this section.

The Targum renders it, a "table"; a writing table, such an one as Zacharias called for, <a href="/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a> and this was to be a "great" or large one, because much was to be written in it; or what was to be written was to be written in large letters: <p>and write in it with a man's pen; such as men usually write with; and in such a style and language as may be easily understood by men, even though unlearned; and so clearly and plainly, that he that runs may read; and so the Targum, <p>"write in it a clear writing;'' <p>very plain, and explicit, and legible: <p>concerning Mahershalalhashbaz; a son of the prophet Isaiah, so called, <a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a> whose name was very significant, and was given him on purpose to express the sudden destruction of the enemies of Judah. The Targum renders it, <p>"hasten to seize the prey, and to take away the spoil.'' <p>Some translate it, "in hastening the prey, the spoiler hastens"; perhaps it may be better rendered, "hasten to the spoil, hasten to the prey"; as if the words were spoken to the Assyrian monarch, to hasten to the spoil of Damascus and Samaria; and the repetition of the same thing in different words may have respect to the spoils of both, see <a href="/isaiah/8-4.htm">Isaiah 8:4</a> and for the greater confirmation of the thing. Gussetius has a very peculiar fancy about the sense of this text; he observes that  rendered a "pen", signifies some hollow vessel, in which things were put; and supposes that it here designs a man's chest, or some such thing, in which garments might be laid up and reserved: and  is the singular of a word used in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-23.htm">Isaiah 3:23</a>, for some sort of luxurious garments wore by women; so that, upon the whole, the reading and sense of the words are, that the prophet is bid to take a large garment of the above sort, and write upon it, putting it into the chest. This for Mahershalalhashbaz; signifying it was to lie there till this child was born; and intimating hereby, that the women, far from battle, would be spoiled of their soft and precious garments, as well as the men be slain in war (m), though this is more tolerable than the fancy of Huetius (n), that the whole is an euphemism, in modest terms, expressing the prophet's coition with his wife. <p>(m) Vid.

The sign of Immanuel was recondite. In its more spiritual sense it appealed to faith in an event far distant. Even in its literal import, it was not calculated to cheer and encourage more than a few, since neither the maiden nor the child was pointed out with any distinctness. A fresh sign was therefore given by God's goodness to reassure the mass of the people  - a sign about which there was nothing obscure or difficult. Isaiah himself should have a son born to him almost immediately, to whom he should give a name indicating the rapid approach of the spoiler, and before this child should be able to utter the first words which childhood ordinarily pronounces, "Father," "Mother," Damascus and Samaria should be despoiled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee a great roll</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">large tablet</span>.

The nation of Judah is regarded here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>, as a man stript naked, and not only with all the hair of his head and feet shaved off (raglaim, a euphemism), but what was regarded as the most shameful of all, with the hair of his beard shaved off as well. To this end the Almighty would make use of a razor, which is more distinctly defined as hired on the shore of the Euphrates (Conductitia in litoribus Euphratis: na&#770;ha&#770;r stands here for hanna&#770;ha&#770;r), and still more precisely as the king of Asshur (the latter is again pronounced a gloss by Knobel and others). "The thing for hire:" hassec&#305;&#772;ra&#770;h might be an abstract term (hiring, Conductio), but it may also be the feminine of sa&#770;c&#305;&#772;r, which indicates an emphatic advance from the indefinite to the more definite; in the sense of "with a razor, namely, that which was standing ready to be hired in the lands on both sides of the Euphrates, the king of Assyria." In hassec&#305;&#772;ra&#770;h (the thing for hire) there was involved the bitterest sarcasm for Ahaz. The sharp knife, which it had hired for the deliverance of Judah, was hired by the Lord, to shave Judah most thoroughly, and in the most disgraceful manner. Thus shaved, Judah would be a depopulated and desert land, in which men would no longer live by growing corn and vines, or by trade and commerce, but by grazing alone. </body></html>
