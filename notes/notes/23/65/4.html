It may be noted, as against the view that the verse points to the practices of the Babylonian exiles, that no reference to swine has been found in any cuneiform inscriptions. In Egypt, as in Palestine, it was looked upon as unclean (Herod. ii. 47, 48). On the worship of Thammuz, see an article by the Rev. A. H.

Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which remain among the graves - That is, evidently for purposes of necromancy and divination. They do it to appear to hold converse with the dead, and to receive communications from them. The idea in necromancy was, that departed spirits must be acquainted with future events, or at least with the secret things of the invisible world where they dwelt, and that certain persons, by various arts, could become intimate with them, or 'familiar' with them, and, by obtaining their secrets, be able to communicate important truths to the living. It seems to have been supposed that this acquaintance might be increased by lodging in the tombs and among the monuments, that they might thus be near to the dead, and have more intimate communion with them (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19-20</a>). It is to be recollected, that tombs among the ancients, and especially in Oriental countries, were commonly excavations from the sides of hills, or frequently were large caves. Such places would furnish spacious lodgings for those who chose to reside there, and were, in fact, often resorted to by those who had no houses, and by robbers (see <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a>; <a href="/mark/5-3.htm">Mark 5:3</a>).<p>And lodge in the monuments - Evidently for some purpose of superstition and idolatry. There is, however, some considerable variety in the exposition of the word rendered here 'monuments,' as well as in regard to the whole passage. The word rendered 'lodge' (&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;  ya&#770;liynu&#770;), means properly to pass the night, and refers not to a permanent dwelling in any place, but to remaining over night; and the probability is, that they went to the places referred to, to sleep - in order that they might receive communications in their dreams from idols, by being near them, or in order that they might have communication with departed spirits. The word rendered 'monuments' (&#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  netsu&#770;r&#305;&#770;ym) is derived from &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;  na&#770;tsar, to watch, to guard, to keep; then to keep from view, to hide - and means properly hidden recesses; and dark and obscure retreats. It may be applied either to the adyta or secret places of pagan temples where their oracles were consulted and many of their rites were performed; or it may be applied to sepulchral caverns, the dark and hidden places where the dead were buried. The Septuagint renders it, 'They sleep in tombs and in caves (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  en tois spe&#772;laiois) for the purpose of dreaming' (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  dia enupnia); in allusion to the custom of sleeping in the temples, or near the oracles of their gods, for the purpose of obtaining from them communications by dreams. This custom is not unfrequently alluded to by the ancient writers. An instance of this kind occurs in Virgil:<p> - huc dona sacerdos<p>Cum tulit, et caesarum ovium sub nocte silenti<p>Pellibus incubuit stratis, somnosque petivit:<p>Multa modis simulacra videt volitantia miris,<p>Et varias audit voces, fruiturque Deorum,<p>Colloquio, atque imis Acheronta affatur Avernis.<p>AEaeid, vii. 86-91.<p>'Here in distress the Italian nations come,<p>Anxious to clear their doubts and earn their doom;<p>First on the fleeces of the slaughter'd sheep,<p>By night the sacred priest dissolves in sleep;<p>When in a train before his slumbering eye,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. remain among &#8230; graves&#8212;namely, for purposes of necromancy, as if to hold converse with the dead (Isa 8:19, 20; compare Mr 5:3); or, for the sake of purifications, usually performed at night among sepulchres, to appease the manes [Maurer].<p>monuments&#8212;Hebrew, "pass the night in hidden recesses," either the idol's inmost shrines ("consecrated precincts") [Horsley], where they used to sleep, in order to have divine communications in dreams [Jerome]; or better, on account of the parallel "graves," sepulchral caves [Maurer].<p>eat swine's flesh&#8212;To eat it at all was contrary to God's law (Le 11:7), but it much increased their guilt that they ate it in idolatrous sacrifices (compare Isa 66:17). Varro (On Agriculture, 2.4) says that swine were first used in sacrifices; the Latins sacrificed a pig to Ceres; it was also offered on occasion of treaties and marriages.<p>broth&#8212;so called from the "pieces" (Margin) or fragments of bread over which the broth was poured [Gesenius]; such broth, made of swine's flesh, offered in sacrifice, was thought to be especially acceptable to the idol and was used in magic rites. Or, "fragments (pieces) of abominable foods," &c. This fourth clause explains more fully the third, as the second does the first [Maurer].<p>is in&#8212;rather, literally, "is their vessels," that is, constitute their vessels' contents. The Jews, in our Lord's days, and ever since the return from Babylon, have been free from idolatry; still the imagery from idolatrous abominations, as being the sin most loathsome in God's eyes and that most prevalent in Isaiah's time, is employed to describe the foul sin of Israel in all ages, culminating in their killing Messiah, and still rejecting Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They remained among the graves, </span> either there expecting revelations by dreams, or there consulting with devils, who were thought to delight in such places; or to practise necromancy, all which were forbidden, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deu 18:11</a> <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a></span>.

This was their iniquity, which is further aggravated in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/65.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which remain among the graves,.... In order to practise necromancy, to consult the dead, where they imagined demons and departed spirits haunted, and of whom they fancied they might get knowledge of future things: <p>and lodge in the monuments: whole nights for the same purposes. The Vulgate Latin version is, "that sleep in the temples of idols"; after the manner of the Heathens, who used to sleep there in order to obtain dreams, whereby they might be able to foretell things to come, as they did in the temple of Aesculapius; or, "in desolate places" (k), as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it; where they expected to meet with demons and noxious spirits, to give them knowledge of things to come. The Targum paraphrases both clauses thus, <p>"who dwell in houses built of the dust of graves, and lodge with the corpse of the children of men;'' <p>so corpse, according to Jarchi, are expressed by this word, which signifies "kept", or "preserved" (l), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, because they are put in a strait place, from whence they cannot get out; though some think idols are meant, called so by way of derision, because kept for fear of being stolen, or because they cannot keep themselves, nor their votaries: <p>which eat swine's flesh; forbidden by the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>, <p>and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; or "pots": broth made of swine's flesh, and of other sorts of flesh which were unclean by the law. Our version follows the marginal (m) reading; as do the Targum, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, and Kimchi; but the written text is, "a fragment" (n), or piece, or pieces, of abominable things; both may be retained in the sense of the passage; slices of flesh unclean, and so abominable by the law, were put into their pots and stewed, and made broth of, which they drank. Spencer (o) thinks the milk in which kids were boiled is meant, which the Zabians kept in vessels, and sprinkled on the trees in their gardens, to make them more fruitful; hence mention is made of idolatrous practices in gardens, in the preceding verse. <p>(k) "In desertis locis", Munster, Pagninus.

From the fact that wild pigs are mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions (Jensen, <span class="ital">Zeitschrift für Assyriologie</span>, Vol. i. pp. 306 ff.) it has been inferred that the Jews were tempted into this during the Exile. But the swine was “forbidden food to all the Semites,” being sacred to more than one deity, and used in sacrifice only in some exceptional rites (W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>2, pp. 218, 290 f., 351).

The word midba&#770;r (pasture-land, heath, different from tsiyya&#770;h, the pastureless desert, <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>) is repeated, for the purpose of showing that the same fate had fallen upon Zion-Jerusalem as upon the rest of the cities of the land. The climax of the terrible calamity was the fact, that the temple had also fallen a prey to the burning of the fire (compare for the fact, <a href="/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>). The people call it "house of our holiness and of our glory." Jehovah's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth have, as it were, transplanted heaven to earth in the temple (compare <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a> with <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>); and this earthly dwelling-place of God is Israel's possession, and therefore Israel's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth. The relative clause describes what sublime historical reminiscences are attached to the temple: &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a> (compare <a href="/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; has chateph-pathach, into which, as a rule, the vocal sheva under the first of two similar letters is changed. Macha&#774;madde&#772;nu&#772; (our delights) may possibly include favourite places, ornamental buildings, and pleasure grounds; but the parallel leads us rather to think primarily of things associated with the worship of God, in which the people found a holy delight. &#1499;&#1500;, contrary to the usual custom, is here followed by the singular of the predicate, as in <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a> (cf., <a href="/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29</a>). Will Jehovah still put restraint upon Himself, and cause His merciful love to keep silence, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, with such a state of things as this, or notwithstanding this state of things (<a href="/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>)? On &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;, see <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>. The suffering would indeed increase &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1491; (to the utmost), if it caused the destruction of Israel, or should not be followed at last by Israel's restoration. Jehovah's compassion cannot any longer thus forcibly restrain itself; it must break forth, like Joseph's tears in the recognition scene (<a href="/genesis/45-1.htm">Genesis 45:1</a>). </body></html>
