In St. Paul’s language, the “whole creation groaneth and travaileth together” (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>). In the new heaven and the new earth of the prophet’s vision there would be no such discords. The flesh-eating beasts should change their nature; even the serpent, named, probably, with special reference to Genesis 3, as the starting-point of the discords, shall find food in the dust in which he crawls, and shall be no longer a destroyer. The condition of the ideal Paradise should be restored. The picture finds a parallel, perhaps a <span class= "ital">replica, </span>in Virgil, <span class= "ital">Eel. </span>4. Do the poet and the prophet stand on the same footing? or may we look for a literal fulfilment of the words of the one, though not of the other? The answer must be given in words that are “wary and few.” We dare not, on the one hand, fix times and seasons, or press the <span class= "ital">letter </span>of prophetic visions as demanding a fulfilment. On the other, the permanence of Israel as a people suggests the possibility of a restored Jerusalem, and modern theories of evolution point to the gradual elimination of the fiercer animals as part of the conquests of humanity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/65.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm" title="The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat.

The former confusions, sins and miseries of the human race, shall be no more remembered or renewed. The approaching happy state of the church is described under a variety of images. He shall be thought to die in his youth, and for his sins, who only lives to the age of a hundred years. The event alone can determine what is meant; but it is plain that Christianity, if universal, would so do away violence and evil, as greatly to lengthen life. In those happy days, all God's people shall enjoy the fruit of their labours. Nor will children then be the trouble of their parents, or suffer trouble themselves. The evil dispositions of sinners shall be completely moritified; all shall live in harmony. Thus the church on earth shall be full of happiness, like heaven. This prophecy assures the servants of Christ, that the time approaches, wherein they shall be blessed with the undisturbed enjoyment of all that is needful for their happiness.

The food of the lion now is flesh. Changes shall take place as great as if his nature were changed, and he should graze with the herds of the field. See a full illustration of this sentiment from the classic writors in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>.<p>Like the bullock - Or the ox - the cattle that herd together - for so the Hebrew word (&#1489;&#1511;&#1512;  ba&#770;qa&#770;r) means. The word may be app ied to a bullock, an ox, or a cow.<p>And dust shall be the serpent's meat - There is evidently here an allusion to the sentence pronounced on the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>. The meaning of the declaration here is, probably, that dust should continue to be the food of the serpent. The sentence on him should be perpetual. He should not be injurious to man - either by tempting him again, or by the venom of his fangs. The state of security would be as great under the Messiah as if the most deadly and poisonous kinds of reptiles should become wholly innoxious, and should not attempt to prey upon people. It is to be remembered that many of the serpent kind included under the general word used here (&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  na&#772;cha&#770;sh), were dangerous to people; and indeed a large portion of them are deadly in their bite. But in future times there will be a state of security as great as if the whole serpent tribe were innocuous and should live on the dust alone. There can be no doubt that the prophet means here to describe the passions and evil propensities of people, which have a strong resemblance to the ferocity of the wolf, or the lion, and the deadly poison of the serpent, and to say that those passions would be subdued, and that peace and concord would prevail on the earth (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>).<p>They shall not hurt nor destroy - See this explained in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>. All this is partially realized wherever the gospel prevails, but it will be more fully realized when that gospel shall exert its full power and shall be spread around the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. (See on [877]Isa 11:6).<p>and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock&#8212;(See on [878]Isa 11:7).<p>and dust&#8212;rather, "but dust," &c. The curse shall remain on the serpent [Horsley], (Ge 3:14; Mic 7:17). "To lick the dust" is figurative of the utter and perpetual degradation of Satan and his emissaries (Isa 49:23; Ps 72:9). Satan fell self-tempted; therefore no atonement was contrived for him, as there was for man, who fell by his temptation (Jude 6; Joh 8:44). From his peculiar connection with the earth and man, it has been conjectured that the exciting cause of his rebellion was God's declaration that human nature was to be raised into union with the Godhead; this was "the truth" concerning the person of the Son of God which "he abode not in"; it galled his pride that a lower race was to be raised to that which he had aspired to (1Ti 3:6). How exultingly he might say, when man fell through him, "God would raise manhood into union with Himself; I have brought it down below the beasts by sin!" At that very moment and spot he was told that the seed of the abhorred race, man, should bruise his head (1Jo 3:8). He was raised up for this, to show forth God's glory (Ex 9:16; Ro 9:17). In his unfallen state he may have been God's vicegerent over the earth and the animal kingdom before man: this will account for his assuming the form of a serpent (Ge 3:1). Man succeeded to that office (Ge 2:19, 20), but forfeited it by sin, whence Satan became "prince of this world"; Jesus Christ supplants the usurper, and as "Son of man" regains the lost inheritance (Ps 8:4-8). The steps in Satan's overthrow are these: he is cast out, first, from heaven (Re 12:7-9) on earth; next, he is bound a thousand years (Re 20:2, 3); finally, he is cast into the lake of fire for ever (Re 20:10).<p>the serpent's meat&#8212;(See on [879]Isa 11:8).<p>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain&#8212;(See on [880]Isa 11:9).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse containeth a promise much like that <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm" title="The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatted calf together; and a little child shall lead them.">Isaiah 11:6</a>,9</span>, and relates to the ceasing of persecution.

But will some say, When shall these things be? The Scripture gives us no record of any such period of time yet past. And it is very probable that this is a promise yet to be fulfilled, and it is not for us to know the times and seasons, but in the mean time to let our faith and patience be seen. In the mean time, we may learn that it is God’s work to restrain the wolves and serpents of the world, who would else be always doing what they are sometimes doing; and it is a sad sign that God is not yet at peace with that people, where we see wolves devouring lambs, and serpents destroying men instead of licking up dust, nor well-pleased with that part of his holy mountain where there is nothing but <span class="ital">hurting and destroying</span>, biting and devouring one another.

Or, "as one" (k): as if they were one, of the same kind and nature, and lived upon the same food. The people of God are comparable to lambs, for their harmlessness and innocence; and wicked men to wolves, for their fierceness and cruelty; but, by the grace of God, the latter become as mild and as gentle as the former, and live upon the same spiritual food, and join with them in attendance on the word and ordinances, where they find spiritual refreshment and comfort together; such who have been persecutors of the church shall now become members of it; and many instances of this kind, as there were in the first times of the Gospel, so there shall be in the latter day: <p>and the lions shall eat straw like the bullock, or "ox"; to which creature the ministers of the Gospel are compared for their laboriousness, as wicked persecutors are to lions; and sometimes the latter have been so changed by the grace of God, as to become preachers of it, as Saul was, and very probably many will hereafter; however, there will be no persecution of the church after those days; wolves and lions will have their nature changed, and be in fellowship with the saints, and be better employed than before in persecuting them: <p>and dust shall be the serpent's meat; the meat of the old serpent, the devil, as was threatened, <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a> to which he shall now be confined; he shall not be able to bite the saints, being bruised under their feet; he shall only have power over carnal, worldly, earthly minded men; and shall not be able to give the church any trouble, by instigating men to persecute it: <p>they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord; that is, Satan and his emissaries; wicked men, comparable to lions and wolves, shall no more drink the blood of the saints, or persecute the church of God; after the calling of the Jews, and the bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles, and the destruction of antichrist, there will be no more persecution of the church of Christ, the mountain of God's holiness; he has said it, and we may be assured of the truth of it; See Gill on <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>. <p>(This verse may also apply to the Millenial state, in which the effects of the curse on the animals is to be removed.

The portraiture here is far less elaborate than in the earlier chapter, to which the present passage may be regarded as a refer-once.

"For behold I create a new heaven and a new earth; and men will not remember the first, nor do they come to any one's mind. No, be ye joyful and exult for ever at that which I:create: for behold I turn Jerusalem into exulting, and her people into joy. And I shall exult over Jerusalem, and be joyous over my people, and the voice of weeping and screaming will be heard in her no more." The promise here reaches its culminating point, which had already been seen from afar in <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>. Jehovah creates a new heaven and a new earth, which bind so fast with their glory, and which so thoroughly satisfy all desires, that there is no thought of the former ones, and no one wishes them back again. Most of the commentators, from Jerome to Hahn, suppose the ri'sho&#772;no&#772;th in <a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a> to refer to the former sorrowful times. Calvin says, "The statement of the prophet, that there will be no remembrance of former things, is supposed by some to refer to the heaven and the earth, as if he meant, that henceforth neither the fame nor even the name of either would any more be heard; but I prefer to refer them to the former times." But the correctness of the former explanation is shown by the parallel in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>, which stands in by no means an accidental relation to this passage, and where it is stated that in the future there will be no ark of the covenant, "neither shall it come to mind, neither shall they remember it," inasmuch as all Jerusalem will be the throne of Jehovah, and not merely the capporeth with its symbolical cherubim. This promise is also a glorious one; but Jeremiah and all the other prophets fall short of the eagle-flight of Isaiah, of whom the same may be said as of John, "volat avis sine meta." Luther (like Zwingli and Stier) adopts the correct rendering, "that men shall no more remember the former ones (i.e., the old heaven and old earth), nor take it to heart." But &#8219;a&#770;la&#770;h &#8219;al-le&#772;bh signifies to come into the mind, not "to take to heart," and is applied to a thing, the thought of which "ascends" within us, and with which we are inwardly occupied. There is no necessity to take the futures in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> as commands (Hitzig); for &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (&#1499;&#1497; with muach, as in Ven. 1521, after the Masora to <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>) fits on quite naturally, even if we take them as simple predictions. Instead of such a possible, though not actual, calling back and wishing back, those who survive the new times are called upon rather to rejoice for ever in that which Jehovah is actually creating, and will have created then. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, if not regarded as the accusative-object, is certainly regarded as the object of causality, "in consideration of that which" (cf., <a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; <a href="/judges/8-15.htm">Judges 8:15</a>), equivalent to, "on account of that which" (see at <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>). The imperatives s&#305;&#772;su&#772; veg&#305;&#772;lu&#772; are not words of admonition so much as words of command, and k&#305;&#772; gives the reason in this sense: Jehovah makes Jerusalem g&#305;&#772;la&#770;h and her people ma&#770;so&#772;s (accusative of the predicate, or according to the terminology adopted in Becker's syntax, the "factitive object," Ges. 139, 2), by making joy its perpetual state, its appointed condition of life both inwardly and outwardly. Nor is it joy on the part of the church only, but on the part of its God as well (see the primary passages in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>). When the church thus rejoices in God, and God in the church, so that the light of the two commingle, and each is reflected in the other; then will no sobbing of weeping ones, no sound of lamentation, be heard any more in Jerusalem (see the opposite side as expressed in <a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). </body></html>
