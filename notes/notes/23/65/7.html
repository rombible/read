Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your iniquities - Their idolatry and their forsaking God, and their arts of necromancy.<p>And the iniquities of your fathers together - The consequences of your own sins, and of the long defection of the nation from virtue and pure religion, shall come rushing upon you like accumulated floods.

Crime had thus been accumulating, like pent-up waters, for ages, and now it swept away every barrier. So crime often accumulates in a nation.

This is far from natural; the better construction is that of the E.V. which makes “iniquities” the obj. to “recompense.” It is probably necessary (with the LXX.) to read “their” in both cases. The iniquities of the fathers are indicated in the following words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which have burnt incense</span> (<span class="bld">have sacrificed</span>,—see on <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13</a>) <span class="ital">upon the mountains</span>] The reference is obviously to the illegal worship of the “high places” or local sanctuaries, which is denounced in similar terms in <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm" title="They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm" title="Then shall you know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet smell to all their idols.">Ezekiel 6:13</a>; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-6.htm" title="And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,">Ezekiel 18:6</a> (if the text be right,—see Davidson on the passage in <span class="ital">Camb.

It must therefore be rendered as an adverb, as in <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm" title="And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.">Jeremiah 16:18</a> (“and first I will recompense their iniquity” &c.).

But instead of commencing with a promise, as we might anticipate after the foregoing prayer, He begins with reproach and threatening; for although the penitential portion of the community had included the whole nation in their prayer, it was destruction, and not deliverance, which awaited one portion of the nation, and that portion was the greater one. The great mass were in that state of "sin unto death" which defies all intercession (<a href="/1_john/5-16.htm">1 John 5:16</a>), because they had so scornfully and obstinately resisted the grace which had been so long and so incessantly offered to them. "I was discernible to those who did not inquire, discoverable by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' to a nation where my name was not called. I spread out my hands all the day to a refractory people, who walked in the way that was not good, after their own thoughts." The lxx (A) render <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>, "I was found by those who did not seek me, I became manifest to those who did not ask for me" (B reverses the order); and in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20-21</a>, Paul refers <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> to the Gentiles, and <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a> to Israel. The former, to whom He has hitherto been strange, enter into fellowship with Him; whilst the latter, to whom He has constantly offered Himself, thrust Him away, and lose His fellowship. Luther accordingly adopts this rendering: "I shall be sought by those who did not ask for me, I shall be found by those who did not seek me. And to the heathen who did not call upon my name, I say, Here am I, here am I." Zwingli, again, observes on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>, "This is an irresistible testimony to the adoption of the Gentiles." Calvin also follows the apostle's exposition, and observes, that "Paul argues boldly for the calling of the Gentiles on the ground of this passage, and says that Isaiah dared to proclaim and assert that the Gentiles had been called by God, because he announced a greater thing, and announced it more clearly than the reason of those times would bear." Of all the Jewish expositors, where is only one, viz., Gecatilia, who refers v. 1 to the Gentiles; and of all the Christina expositors of modern times, there is only one, viz., Hendewerk, who interprets it in this way, without having been influenced by the quotation made by Paul. Hofman, however, and Stier, feel obliged to follow the apostle's exposition, and endeavour to vindicate it. But we have no sympathy with any such untenable efforts to save the apostle's honour. In <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>, he also quotes <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a> and <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a> in support of the calling of the Gentiles; whereas he could not have failed to know, that it is the restoration of Israel to favour which is alluded to there. He merely appeals to <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a> in support of the New Testament fact of the calling of the Gentiles, so far as it is in these words of the Old Testament prophet that the fact is most adequately expressed. And according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, Peter received the same impression from Hosea's words. <p>But with the passage before us it is very different. The apostle shows, by the way in which he applies the Scripture, how he depended in this instance upon the Septuagint translation, which was in his own hands and those of his readers also, and by which the allusion to the Gentiles is naturally suggested, even if not actually demanded. And we may also assume that the apostle himself understood the Hebrew text, with which he, the pupil of Rabban Gamaliel, was of course well acquainted, in the same sense, viz., as relating to the calling of the Gentiles, without being therefore legally bound to adopt the same interpretation. The interchange of &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; (cf., <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>) and &#1506;&#1501;; the attribute &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488;, which applies to heathen, and heathen only; the possibility of interpreting <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1-2</a>, in harmony with the context both before and after, if <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> be taken as referring to the Gentiles, on the supposition that Jehovah is here contrasting His success with the Gentiles and His failure with Israel: all these certainly throw weight into the scale. Nevertheless they are not decisive, if we look at the Hebrew alone, apart altogether from the lxx. For nidrasht&#305;&#772; does not mean "I have become manifest;" but, regarded as the so-called niphal tolerativum (according to <a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm">Ezekiel 20:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a>), "I permitted myself to be explored or found out;" and consequently &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, "I let myself be found." And so explained, <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> stands in a parallel relation to <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a> : Jehovah was searchable, was discoverable (cf., <a href="/zephaniah/1-6.htm">Zephaniah 1:6</a>) to those who asked no questions, and did not seek Him (&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Ges. 123, 3), i.e., He displayed to Israel the fulness of His nature and the possibility of His fellowship, although they did not bestir themselves or trouble themselves in the least about Him - a view which is confirmed by the fact that <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> merely refers to offers made to them, and not to results of any kind. Israel, however, is called &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, not as a nation that was not called by Jehovah's name (which would be expressed by &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>; cf., &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, <a href="/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>), but as a nation where (supply 'a&#774;sher) Jehovah's name was not invoked (lxx "who called not upon my name"), and therefore as a thoroughly heathenish nation; for which reason we have go&#772;i (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) here, and not &#8219;am (lxx &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;). Israel was estranged from Him, just like the heathen; but He still turned towards them with infinite patience, and (as is added in <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>) with ever open arms of love. He spread out His hands (as a man does to draw another towards him to embrace him) all the day (i.e., continually, cf., <a href="/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24</a>) towards an obstinate people, who walked in the way that was not good (cf., <a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-29.htm">Proverbs 16:29</a>; here with the article, which could not be repeated with the adjective, because of the &#1500;&#1488;), behind their own thoughts. That which led them, and which they followed, was not the will of God, but selfish views and purposes, according to their won hearts' lusts; and yet Jehovah did not let them alone, but they were the constant thought and object of His love, which was ever seeking, alluring, and longing for their salvation. </body></html>
