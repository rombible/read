They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed.

The word &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;  ma&#770;niytiy, 'I will number,' is derived from &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  ma&#770;na&#770;h, the same word from which &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;  men&#305;&#770;y, is derived. The idea is, since they worshipped a god whose name denoted number - perhaps one who was supposed to number or appoint the fates of people - God would number them. He would determine their destiny. It would not be done by any idol that was supposed to preside over the destinies of people; not by blind fate, or by anyone of the heavenly bodies, but it would be by an intelligent and holy God. And thus numbering or determining their lot would not be in accordance with their expectations, imparting to them a happy fortune, but would be devoting them to the sword; that is, to destruction. The allusion is, probably, to the calamities which God afterward brought on them by the invasion of the Chaldeans.<p>And ye shall all bow down to the slaughter - This is evidently strong, and probably hyperbolic language, meaning that a large portion of the nation would be cut off by the sword. The allusion here is, I think, to the slaughter of the Jewish people in the invasion of the Chaldeans. The evil of idolatry prevailed, in the time of Isaiah, under the reign of Manasseh; and in the time of Zedekiah it had increased so much even in Jerusalem, that it was said, 'All the chief priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the pagan; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .... And they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, until there was no remedy. Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young people with the sword, in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age; he gave them all into their hand <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16-17</a>. It is possible, also, that this is intended to express a more general truth, and to intimate that when his people forsake him he will punish them; but the primary reference, it is proable, was to the slaughter caused by the Babylonians when they destroyed Jerusalem.<p>Because when I called - When I called you by the prophets to repentance and to my service (see <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> ff.)<p>Ye did not answer - You showed the same disregard and contempt which a child does who suffers a parent to call him, and who pays no attention to it. One of the chief aggravations of human guilt is, that the sinner pays no attention to the calls of God. He pretends not to hear; or he hears to disregard it. No more decided contempt can be shown to the Almighty; no deeper proof of the stupidity and guilt of people can be furnished.<p>But did evil before mine eyes - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. number&#8212;"doom" you. Alluding to the "number," as Meni (Isa 65:11) means. Retribution in kind, the punishment answering to the sin (compare 2Ch 36:14-17).<p>I called, ye &#8230; not answer&#8212;"I called," though "none had called" upon Me (Isa 64:7); yet even then none "answered" (Pr 1:24).

In matters of worship we ought to choose nothing wherein God delighteth not; and reason as well as Scripture will assure us he can delight in nothing of that nature which himself hath not directed. It is observable, that ruin is here threatened to this people, not for their immoralities or lewd lives, but for their errors and superstitions in Divine worship. Other sins provoke God to wrath, but those of this nature alone are enough to ruin souls and nations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/65.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore will I number you to the sword,....

"Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence without having recompensed, and I will recompense into their bosom. Your offences, and the offences of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that they have burned incense upon the mountains, and insulted me upon the hills, and I measure their reward first of all into their bosom." Vitringa has been misled by such passages as <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>; <a href="/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>, in which ka&#770;thabh (kitte&#772;bh) is used to signify a written decree, and understands by khethu&#772;bha&#770;h the sentence pronounced by God; but the reference really is to their idolatrous conduct and contemptuous defiance of the laws of God. This is ever before Him, written in indelible characters, waiting for the day of vengeance; for, according to the figurative language of Scripture, there are heavenly books, in which the good and evil works of men are entered. And this agrees with what follows: "I will not be silent, without having first repaid," etc. The accentuation very properly places the tone upon the penultimate of the first shillamt&#305;&#772; as being a pure perfect, and upon the last syllable of the second as a perf. consec. &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; preceded by a future and followed by a perfect signifies, "but if (without having) first," etc. (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-6.htm">Leviticus 22:6</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-18.htm">Ruth 3:18</a>; cf., <a href="/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a>). The original train of thought was, "I will not keep silence, for I shall first of all keep silence when," etc. Instead of &#8219;al che&#772;qa&#770;m, "Upon their bosom," we might have 'el che&#772;qa&#770;m, into their bosom, as in <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>. In <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a> the keri really has 'el instead of &#8219;al, whilst in <a href="/isaiah/65-9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a> the chethib is &#8219;al without any keri (for the figure itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, "into your bosom"). The thing to be repaid follows in <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>; it is not governed, however, by shillamt&#305;&#772;, as the form of the address clearly shows, but by 'a&#774;shalle&#772;m understood, which may easily be supplied. Whether 'a&#774;sher is to be taken in the sense of qui or quod (that), it is hardly possible to decide; but the construction of the sentence favours the latter. Sacrificing "upon mountains and hills" (and, what is omitted, here, "under every green tree") is the well-known standing phrase used to describe the idolatry of the times preceding the captivity (cf., <a href="/isaiah/57-7.htm">Isaiah 57:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>). &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; points back to veshillamt&#305;&#772; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a>, after the object has been more precisely defined. Most of the modern expositors take &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; together, in the sense of "their former wages," i.e., the recompense previously deserved by their fathers. But in this case the concluding clause would only affirm, by the side of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>, that the sins of the fathers would be visited upon them. Moreover, this explanation has not only the accents against it, but also the parallel in <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a> (see Hitzig), which evidently stands in a reciprocal relation to the passage before us. Consequently ri'sho&#772;na&#770;h must be an adverb, and the meaning evidently is, that the first thing which Jehovah had to do by virtue of His holiness was to punish the sins of the apostate Israelites; and He would so punish them that inasmuch as the sins of the children were merely the continuation of the fathers' sins, the punishment would be measured out according to the desert of both together. </body></html>
