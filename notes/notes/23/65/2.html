Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have spread out my hands - To spread out the hands is an action denoting invitation or entreaty <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a>. The sense is, that God had invited the Jews constantly to partake of his favors, but they had been rebellious, and had rejected his offers.<p>All the day - I have not ceased to do it. The Chaldee renders this, 'I sent my prophets all the day to a rebellious people.'<p>Unto a rebellious people - (See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).

This is the general reason why he had rejected them, and why he had resolved to make the offer of salvation to the Gentiles. This, at first, was a reason for the calamities which God had brought upon the nation in the suffering of the exile, but it also contains a general principle of which that was only one specimen. They had been rebellious, and God had brought this calamity upon them. It would be also true in future times, that he would reject them and offer salvation to the pagan world, and would be found by those who had never sought for him or called on his name. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. spread out &#8230; hands&#8212;inviting them earnestly (Pr 1:24).<p>all &#8230; day&#8212;continually, late and early (Jer 7:13).<p>rebellious people&#8212;Israel, whose rebellion was the occasion of God's turning to the Gentiles (Ro 11:11, 12, 15).<p>way &#8230; not good&#8212;that is, the very reverse of good, very bad (Eze 36:31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have spread out my hands; </span> applied to the Jews, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a></span>, <span class="ital">I have stretched out my hands</span>; that is, I have used all probable means to reduce them, I have stretched out the <span class="ital">hands</span> of a passionate orator to persuade them, of a <span class="ital">tender mother</span> to protect and defend them, of a <span class="ital">liberal benefactor</span> to lead them with my benefits; this I have done continually in the whole course of my providence with them, yet they are a <span class="ital">rebellious people</span>.

If these be the paganised Israelites of the North who had not shared the Captivity the two verses reveal an important fact not otherwise recorded.

They were carried into exile, where they sank deeper and deeper. The great mass of the people proved themselves to be really massa perdita, and perished among the heathen. But there were some, though a vanishingly small number, who humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God, and, when redemption could not be far off, wrestled in such prayers as these, that the nation might share it in its entirety, and if possible not one be left behind. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; the existing state of sin and punishment is placed among the things of the past, and the petition presented that the present moment of prayer may have all the significance of a turning-point in their history. "And now, O Jehovah, Thou art our Father: we are the clay, and Thou our Maker; and we are all the work of Thy hand. Be not extremely angry, O Jehovah, and remember not the transgression for ever! Behold, consider, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people." The state of things must change at last; for Israel is an image made by Jehovah; yea, more than this, Jehovah is the begetter of Israel, and loves Israel not merely as a sculptor, but as a father (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9-10</a>, and the unquestionable passage of Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>). Let Him then not be angry &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, "to the utmost measure" (cf., <a href="/psalms/119-8.htm">Psalm 119:8</a>), or if we paraphrase it according to the radical meaning of &#1502;&#1491;, "till the weight becomes intolerable." Let Him not keep in mind the guilt for ever, to punish it; but, in consideration of the fact that Israel is the nation of His choice, let mercy take the place of justice. &#1492;&#1503; strengthens the petition in its own way (see <a href="/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34</a>), just as &#1504;&#1488; does; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; signifies here, as elsewhere, to fix the eye upon anything. The object, in this instance, is the existing fact expressed in "we are all Thy people." Hitzig is correct in regarding the repetition of "all of us" in this prayer as significant. The object throughout is to entreat that the whole nation may participate in the inheritance of the coming salvation, in order that the exodus from Babylonia may resemble the exodus from Egypt. </body></html>
