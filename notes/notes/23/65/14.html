They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed. They shall think themselves happy in having him for their God, who made them forget their troubles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall sing for joy of heart - They who serve me shall have abundant occasion of rejoicing.

"Thus saith Jehovah, As when the must is found in the cluster, men say, Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing within it, so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and an heir of my mountains out of Judah, and my chosen ones shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there." Of the two co-ordinate clauses of the protasis (<a href="/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), the first contains the necessary condition of the second. Hatt&#305;&#772;ro&#772;sh (must, or the juice of the grapes, from ya&#770;rash, possibly primarily nothing more than receipt, or the produce of labour) and ba&#770;'eshko&#772;l have both of them the article generally found in comparisons (Ges. 109, Anm. 1); &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, "men say," with the most general and indefinite subject. As men to not destroy a juicy cluster of grapes, because they would thereby destroy the blessing of God which it contains; so will Jehovah for His servants' sake not utterly destroy Israel, but preserve those who are the clusters in the vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) or upon the vine (<a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>.) of Israel. He will not destroy hakko&#772;l, the whole without exception; that is to say, keeping to the figure, not "the juice with the skin and stalk," as Knobel and Hahn explain it, but "the particular clusters in which juice is contained, along with the degenerate neglected vineyard or vine, which bears for the most part only sour grapes (<a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>) or tendrils without fruit (cf., <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>). The servants of Jehovah, who resemble these clusters, remain preserved. Jehovah brings out, causes to go forth, calls to the light of day (&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;) as in <a href="/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>; here, however, it is by means of sifting: <a href="/ezekiel/20-34.htm">Ezekiel 20:34</a>.), out of Jacob and Judah, i.e., the people of the two captivities (see <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>), a seed, a family, that takes possession of His mountains, i.e., His holy mountain-land (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, and har qodsh&#305;&#772;, which is used in the same sense in <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>). As "my mountain" is equivalent in sense to the "land of Israel," for which Ezekiel is fond of saying "the mountains of Israel" (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>), the promise proceeds still further to say, "and my chosen ones will take possession thereof" (viz., of the land, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>). </body></html>
