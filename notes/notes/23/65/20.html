(Comp. <a href="/zechariah/8-4.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.">Zechariah 8:4</a>.) He who dies at the age of a hundred will be thought of as dying young; even the sinner, dying before his time as the penalty of his guilt, shall live out the measure of a century. The noticeable fact is that sin is thought of as not altogether extinct—as still appearing, though under altered conditions, even in the restored Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/65.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm" title="There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.">Isaiah 65:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, </span>&c. — There shall he no untimely or premature deaths, either of infants and children, who do not grow up to man’s estate, or of old men, who do not live out the full term of life. <span class="ital">For the child shall die, </span>&c. — This should rather be translated, <span class="ital">For he that dies a hundred years old shall die a child: and the sinner that dies a hundred years old shall be </span>(that is, <span class="ital">shall be </span>deemed) <span class="ital">accursed, </span>or cut off by the justice of God for his crime. Thus “the prophet describes this renovation of the world as a paradisiacal state, and such as the patriarchs enjoyed before the flood, when men commonly lived nearly a thousand years. So he that died at a hundred years of age would have been looked upon as dying in the age of childhood, and be judged to have been cut off in the beginning of his years, as a punishment for some great sins he had committed.” — Lowth. It is justly observed here by Mr. Scott, that “the event alone can certainly determine whether this is meant literally or figuratively; but it is evident that the universal prevalence of real Christianity would so terminate wars, murders, contentions, idleness, intemperance, and licentiousness, as greatly to lengthen out the general term of man’s life. Many diseases which now destroy thousands and tens of thousands in the prime of life, and communicate distempers to succeeding generations, would, in that case, scarcely be heard of any more; and thus the human constitution would soon be much mended, and children would generally come into the world more vigorous and healthy than they can do while vice so greatly prevails. What God may further intend in this matter we cannot determine.” Vitringa’s view of the passage seems to have been, that “there shall be no violent or punitive death in this holy city, but that all the inhabitants being holy, all shall die full of days and happy, and shall have, as it were, a foretaste, pledge, and earnest of life eternal, in their long and happy life below.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>65:17-25 In the grace and comfort believers have in and from Christ, we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. The former confusions, sins and miseries of the human race, shall be no more remembered or renewed. The approaching happy state of the church is described under a variety of images. He shall be thought to die in his youth, and for his sins, who only lives to the age of a hundred years. The event alone can determine what is meant; but it is plain that Christianity, if universal, would so do away violence and evil, as greatly to lengthen life. In those happy days, all God's people shall enjoy the fruit of their labours. Nor will children then be the trouble of their parents, or suffer trouble themselves. The evil dispositions of sinners shall be completely moritified; all shall live in harmony. Thus the church on earth shall be full of happiness, like heaven. This prophecy assures the servants of Christ, that the time approaches, wherein they shall be blessed with the undisturbed enjoyment of all that is needful for their happiness. As workers together with God, let us attend his ordinances, and obey his commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There shall be no more thence - The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, read this, 'There shall not be there.' The change requires the omission of a single letter in the present Hebrew text, and the sense seems to demand it. The design of the prophet here is, to describe the times of happiness and prosperity which would succeed the calamities under which the nation had been suffering. This he does by a great variety of images, all denoting substantially the same thing. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>, the change is represented to be as great as if a new heaven and a new earth should be created; in this verse the image is, that the inhabitants would reach a great age, and that the comparatively happy times of the patriarchs would be restored; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a>, the image is taken from the perfect security in their plans of labor, and the fact that they would enjoy the fruit of their toil; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, the image employed is that taken from the change in the nature of the animal creation. All these are poetic images designed as illustrations of the general truth, and, like other poetic images, they are not to be taken literally.<p>An infant of days - A child; a sucking child. So the Hebrew word, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;  &#8219;u&#770;l, denotes. The Septuagint renders it, 'Nor shall there be there anymore an untimely birth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ao&#772;ros) and an old man who has not filled up his time.' The idea is not that there should be no infant in those future times - which would be an idea so absurd that a prophet would not use it even in poetic fiction - but that there will not be an infant who shall not fill up his days, or who will be short-lived. All shall live long, and all shall be blessed with health, and continual vigor and youth.<p>Nor an old man that hath not filled his days - They shall enjoy the blessings of great longevity, and that not a longevity that shall be broken and feeble, but which shall be vigorous and happy. In further illustration of this sentiment, we may remark,<p>1. That there is no reason to suppose that it will be literally fulfilled even in the millenium. If it is to be regarded as literally to be fulfilled, then for the same reason we are to suppose that in that time the nature of the lion will be literally changed, and that he will eat straw like the ox, and that the nature of the wolf and the lamb will be so far changed that they shall lie down together <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>. But there is no reason to suppose this; nor is there any good reason to suppose that literally no infant or child will die in those times, or that no old man will be infirm, or that all will live to the same great age.<p>2. The promise of long life is regarded in the Bible as a blessing, and is an image, everywhere, of prosperity and happiness. Thus the patriarchs were regarded as having been highly-favored people, because God lengthened out their days; and throughout the Scriptures it is represented as a proof of the favor of God, that a man is permitted to live long, and to see a numerous posterity (see <a href="/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/128-6.htm">Psalm 128:6</a> (Hebrew); <a href="/psalms/91-16.htm">Psalm 91:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2-14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>.<p>3. No one can doubt that the prevalence of the gospel everywhere would greatly lengthen out the life of man. Let anyone reflect on the great number that are now cut off in childhood in pagan lands by their parents, all of whom would have been spared had their parents been Christians; on the numbers of children who are destroyed in early life by the effects of the intemperance of their parents, most of whom would have survived if their parents had been virtuous; on the numbers of young men now cut down by vice, who would have continued to live if they had been under the influence of the gospel; on the immense hosts cut off, and most of them in middle life, by war, who would have lived to a good old age if the gospel had prevailed and put a period to wars; on the million who are annually cut down by intemperance and lust, and other raging passions, by murder and piracy, or who are punished by death for crime; on the million destroyed by pestilential disease sent by offended heaven on guilty nations; and let him reflect that these sources of death will be dried up by the prevalence of pure virtue and religion, and he will see that a great change may yet take place literally in the life of man.<p>4. A similar image is used by the classic writers to denote a golden age, or an age of great prosperity and happiness. Thus the Sybil, in the Sybilline Oracles, B. vii., speaking of the future age, says, &#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Ste&#772;sei de to genos, ho&#772;s paros e&#772;n soi - 'A race shall be restored as it was in the ancient times.' So Hesiod, describing the silver age, introduces a boy as having reached the age of an hundred years, and yet but a child:<p>&#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;,<p>&#x395;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#787;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#837;.<p>All' hekaton men tais etea para me&#772;teri kednr,<p>Etrephet atallo&#772;n mega ne&#772;pios o&#772; eni oiko&#772;.<p>For the child shall die an hundred years old - That is, he that is an hundred years old when he dies, shall still be a child or a youth. This is nearly the same sentiment which is expressed by Hesiod, as quoted above. The prophet has evidently in his eye the longevity of the patriarchs, when an individual of an hundred years of age was comparatively young - the proportion between that and the usual period of life then being about the same as that between the age of ten and the usual period of life now. We are not, I apprehend, to suppose that this is to be taken literally, but it is figurative language, designed to describe the comparatively happy state referred to by the prophet, as if human life should be lengthened out to the age of the patriarchs, and as if he who is now regarded as an old man, should then be regarded as in the vigor of his days. At the same time it is true, that the influence of temperance, industry, and soberness of life, such as would exist if the rules of the gospel were obeyed, would carry forward the vigor of youth far into advancing years, and mitigate most of the evils now incident to the decline of life.<p>The few imperfect experiments which have been made of the effect of entire temperance and of elevated virtue; of subduing the passions by the influence of the gospel, and of prudent means for prolonging health and life, such as the gospel will prompt a man to use, who has any just view of the value of life, show what may yet be done in happier times. It is an obvious reflection here, that if such effects are to be anticipated from the prevalence of true religion and of temperance, then he is the best friend of man who endeavors most sedulously to bring others under the influence of the gospel, and to extend the principles of temperance and virtue. The gospel of Christ would do more to prolong human life than all other causes combined; and when that prevails everywhere, putting a period, as it must, to infanticide, and war, and intemperance, and murder, and piracy, and suicide, and duelling, and raging and consuming passions, then it is impossible for the most vivid imagination to conceive the effect which shall be produced on the health and long life, as well as on the happiness of mankind.<p>But the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed - The sense of this appears to be, 'not all who reach to a great age shall be judged to be the friends and favorites of God. Though a sinner shall reach that advanced period of life, yet he shall be cursed of God and shall be cut down in his sins. He shall be held to be a sinner and shall die, and shall be regarded as accursed.' Other interpretations of this expression may be seen in Poole and in Vitringa. The above seems to me to be the true exposition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

This passage proves that the better age to come on earth, though much superior to the present will not be a perfect state; sin and death shall have place in it (compare Re 20:7, 8), but much less frequently than now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whereas God hath made many promises of long life to the Jews, they should all be fulfilled to God’s people among them, so as there should be rare abortions among them, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/23-26.htm" title="There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in your land: the number of your days I will fulfill.">Exodus 23:26</a></span>; few infants should be carried out to burial, nor but few that should not have filled up their years; those that were now children should die at a great age; yet none of these things should be of any advantage to wicked men, but if, any of them should live to be.a hundred years old, yet they should die accursed.

What is most remarkable in the description is that death and sin are represented as still continuing. Death was spoken of as "swallowed up in victory" in one of the earlier descriptions of Messiah's kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/65.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the ground of the sin thus referred to again, the proclamation of punishment is renewed, and the different fates awaiting the servants of Jehovah and those by whom He is despised are here announced in five distinct theses and antitheses. "Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah: Behold my servants will eat, but ye will hunger; behold my servants will drink, but ye will thirst; behold my servants will rejoice, but ye will be put to shame; behold my servants will exult for delight of heart, but ye will cry for anguish of heart, and ye will lament for brokenness of spirit. And ye will leave your name for a curse to my chosen ones, and the Lord, Jehovah, will slay thee; but His servants He will call by another name, to that whoever blesseth himself in the land will bless himself by the God of truthfulness, and whoever sweareth in the land will swear by the God of truthfulness, because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they have vanished from mine eyes." The name Adonai is connected with the name Jehovah for the purpose of affirming that the God of salvation and judgment has the power to carry His promises and threats into execution. Starving, confounded by the salvation they had rejected (&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>), crying and wailing (&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, fut. hiph. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, with a double preformative; Ges. 70, 2 Anm.) for sorrow of heart and crushing of spirit (shebher, rendered very well by the lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; ), the rebellious ones are left behind in the land of captivity, whilst the servants of Jehovah enjoy the richest blessings from God in the land of promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8-9</a>). The former, perishing in the land of captivity, leave their name to the latter as shebhu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, i.e., to serve as a formula by which to swear, or rather to execrate or curse (<a href="/numbers/5-21.htm">Numbers 5:21</a>), so that men will say, "Jehovah slay thee, as He slew them." This, at any rate, is the meaning of the threat; but the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; cannot contain the actual formula, not even if we drop the Vav, as Knobel proposes, and change &#1500;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; into &#1500;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;; for, in the first place, although in the doxologies a Hebrew was in the habit of saying "beru&#772;kh shemo&#772;" (bless his name) instead of yeh&#305;&#772; shemo&#772; ba&#770;rukh (his name be blessed), he never went so far as the Arab with his Alla&#770;h taba&#770;r, but said rather &#1497;&#1514;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;. Still less could he make use of the perfect (indicative) in such sentences as "may he slay thee," instead of the future (voluntative) &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498;, unless the perfect shared the optative force of the previous future by virtue of the consecutio temporum. And secondly, the indispensable &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; would be wanting (see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>, cf., <a href="/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a>). We may therefore assume, that the prophet has before his mind the words of this imprecatory formula, though he does not really express them, and that he deduces from it the continuation of the threat. And this explains his passing from the plural to the singular. Their name will become an execration; but Jehovah will call His servants by another name (cf., <a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>), so that henceforth it will be the God of the faithfully fulfilled promise whose name men take into their mouth when they either desire a blessing or wish to give assurance of the truth (hithba&#770;r be, to bless one's self with any one, or with the name of any one; Ewald, 133, Anm. 1). No other name of any god is now heard in the land, except this gloriously attested name; for the former troubles, which included the mixed condition of Israel in exile and the persecution of the worshippers of Jehovah by the despisers of Jehovah, are now forgotten, so that they no longer disturb the enjoyment of the present, and are eve hidden from the eyes of God, so that all thought of ever renewing them is utterly remote from His mind. This is the connection between <a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-13.htm">Isaiah 65:13-15</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not mean eo quod here, as in <a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a> for example, but ita ut, as in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>. What follows is the result of the separation accomplished and the promise fulfilled. For the same reason God is called Elohe&#772;'a&#770;me&#772;n, "the God of Amen," i.e., the God who turns what He promises into Yea and Amen (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). The epithet derived from the confirmatory Amen, which is thus applied to Jehovah, is similar to the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, where Jesus is called "the Amen, the faithful and true witness." The explanatory k&#305;&#772; (for) is emphatically repeated in &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;, as in <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/19-4.htm">1 Samuel 19:4</a> (compare <a href="/job/38-20.htm">Job 38:20</a>). The inhabitants of the land stand in a close and undisturbed relation to the God who has proved Himself to be true to His promises; for all the former evils that followed from the sin have entirely passed away. </body></html>
