Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall.

Such transitions are not uncommon in the writings of Isaiah. His eye seems to have been directed in vision to the hosts of Sennacherib, and to their sudden dispersion and destruction <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, and by a sudden, but not unnatural transition, he turns and addresses the army itself, with the assurance that it should be punished (compare <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>).<p>With thunder ... - The army of the Assyrian was cut off by an angel sent forth from God <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>. It is "possible" that all the agents here referred to may have been employed in the destruction of the Assyrian host, though they are not particularly specified in the history. But it is not absolutely. necessary to understand this verse in this manner. The image of thunder, earthquakes, and lightning, is an impressive representation of sudden and awful judgment in any manner. The sense is, that they should be suddenly destroyed by the direct visitation of God (see <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>).<p>And the flame of devouring fire - Lightning, that seems to "devour," or that suddenly consumes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

"For the black poppy is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cummin; but black poppy is knocked out with a stick, and cummin with a staff. Is bread corn crushed? No; he does not go on threshing it for ever, and drive the wheel of his cart and his horses over it: he does not crush it. This also, it goeth forth from Jehovah of hosts: He gives wonderful intelligence, high understanding." Ki (for) introduces another proof that the husbandman is instructed by God, from what he still further does. He does not use the threshing machine (cha&#770;ru&#772;ts, syn. mo&#772;rag, Ar. naureg, no&#772;reg), or the threshing cart (aga&#770;la&#770;h: see Winer's Real-Wrterbuch, art. Dreschen), which would entirely destroy the more tender kinds of fruit, but knocks them out with a staff (baculo excutit: see at <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>). The sentence lechem yu&#772;da&#770;q is to be accentuated as an interrogative: Is bread corn crushed? Oh no, he does not crush it. This would be the case if he were to cause the wheel (i.e., the wheels, gilgal, constr. to galgal) of the threshing cart with the horses harnessed in front to rattle over it with all their might (ha&#770;mam, to set in noisy violent motion). Lechem, like the Greek sitos, is corn from which bread is made (<a href="/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>). &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is metaplastic (as if from &#1488;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) for &#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (see Ewald, 312, b). Instead of &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;, the pointing ought to be &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; (from &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with kametz before the tone  equals  Arab. faras, as distinguished from &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with a fixed kametz, equivalent to farras, a rider): "his horses," here the threshing horses, which were preferred to asses and oxen.Even in this treatment of the fruit when reaped, there is an evidence of the wonderful intelligence (&#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;), as written &#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;) and exalted understanding (on &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, from &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, see at <a href="/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>) imparted by God. The expression is one of such grandeur, that we perceive at once that the prophet has in his mind the wisdom of God in a higher sphere. The wise, divinely inspired course adopted by the husbandman in the treatment of the field and fruit, is a type of the wise course adopted by the divine Teacher Himself in the treatment of His nation. Israel is Jehovah's field. The punishments and chastisements of Jehovah are the ploughshare and harrow, with which He forcibly breaks up, turns over, and furrows this field. But this does not last for ever. When the field has been thus loosened, smoothed, and rendered fertile once more, the painful process of ploughing is followed by a beneficent sowing and planting in a multiform and wisely ordered fulness of grace. Again, Israel is Jehovah's child of the threshing-floor (see <a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). He threshes it; but He does not thresh it only: He also knocks; and when He threshes, He does not continue threshing for ever, i.e., as Caspari has well explained it, "He does not punish all the members of the nation with the same severity; and those whom He punishes with greater severity than others He does not punish incessantly, but as soon as His end is attained, and the husks of sin are separated from those that have been punished, and the punishment ceases, and only the worst in the nation, who are nothing but husks, and the husks on the nation itself, are swept away by the punishments" (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20-21</a>). This is the solemn lesson and affectionate consolation hidden behind the veil of the parable. Jehovah punishes, but it is in order that He may be able to bless. He sifts, but He does not destroy. He does not thresh His own people, but He knocks them; and even when He threshes, they may console themselves in the face of the approaching period of judgment, that they are never crushed or injured. </body></html>
