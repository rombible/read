The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stay yourselves - Thus far the prophet had given a description of the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib, and of his sudden overthrow. He now turns to the Jews, and reproves their stupidity, formality, and hypocrisy; and the remainder of the chapter is occupied with a statement of the prevalence of these sins, of the judgments that must follow, and of the fact that there should yet be an extensive reformation, and turning to the Lord. The word rendered 'stay yourselves' (&#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;  h&#305;&#770;temahemehu&#770;) means properly "to linger," tarry, delay <a href="/genesis/19-16.htm">Genesis 19:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>. Here it seems to denote that state of mind in which anyone is "fixed in astonishment;" in which one stops, and stares at some strange and unexpected occurrence. The object of amazement which the prophet supposes would excite astonishment, was the stupidity, dulness, and hypocrisy of a people who had been so signally favored (compare <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>).<p>Cry ye out, and cry - There is in the original here a paronomasia which cannot be conveyed in a translation. The word which is used (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  h&#305;&#770;sheta&#8219;ashe&#8219;u&#770;) is one form of the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;  sha&#770;&#8219;a&#8219;, which means, usually, to make smooth, rub, spread over; hence, in the Hithpael form which is used here, to be spread over; and hence, is applied to the eyes <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, to denote blindness, as if they were overspread with something by reason of which they could not see. Here it probably means, 'be ye dazzled and blinded,' that is, ye be astonished, as in the former part of the verse. The idea seems to be that of some object of sudden astonishment that dims the sights and takes away all the powers of vision. The word is used in the same sense in <a href="/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>. Probably the idea here would be well expressed by our word "stare," 'stare and look with a stupid surprise;' denoting the attitude and condition of a man who is amazed at some remarkable and unlooked for spectacle.<p>They are drunken, but not with wine - The people of Jerusalem. They reel and stagger, but the cause is not that they are drunken with wine. It is a moral and spiritual intoxication and reeling. They err in their doctrines and practice; and it is with them as it is with a drunken man that sees nothing clearly or correctly, and cannot walk steadily. They have perverted all doctrines; they err in their views of God and his truth, and they are irregular and corrupt in their conduct. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Stop a while, pause a little, consider within yourselves the case and circumstances of these people, and wonder at their stupidity. Kimchi thinks these words were spoken in the times of Ahaz, with respect to the men of Judah; and so Aben Ezra says, they are directed to the men of Zion; and it is generally thought that they are spoken to the more religious and sober part of them; though, by the following verse <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, it appears that the case was general, and that the people to whom this address is made were as stupid as others: <p>cry ye out, and cry; or, "delight yourselves" (s), as in the margin; take your pleasure, indulge yourselves in carnal mirth, gratify your sensual appetite in rioting and wantonness, and then "cry" and lament, as you will have reason to do. Kimchi says, his father rendered the words, "awake yourselves, and awake others"; that is, from that deep sleep they were fallen into, afterwards mentioned: <p>they are drunken, but not with wine; not with that only, for otherwise many of them were given to drunkenness in a literal sense, <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a> but they were like drunken men, as stupid, senseless, and secure, though in the utmost danger: <p>they stagger, but not with strong drink; unsteady in their counsels and resolutions, in their principles and practices, and stumble in their goings. <p>(s) "oblectate vos", Cocceius; "delicias agunt", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "deliciantur", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</span><p>(h) Muse on this a long as ye like, yet you will find nothing but opportunity to be astonished for your prophets are blind, and therefore cannot direct you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Stay yourselves, and wonder</span>] Rather (as R.V. marg.), <span class="bld">Be ye amazed and wonder</span>.

It was among the most painful circumstances attaching to the prophetical office, that scarcely ever was the prophet held in any esteem among his own people, or in his own lifetime. Isaiah knows that his warning will fall dead - that the people and their rulers have neither "eyes to see" nor "ears to hear." He places on record this knowledge, while at the same time striving if by any means he may arouse some from their condition of dull apathy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stay yourselves, and wonder</span>; rather, <span class="accented">stand stupefied and be astonished</span>. The prophet bids them act as he knows that they will act. They will simply "stare with astonishment" at a prophecy which will seem to them "out of all relation to facts" (Cheyne). They will not yield it the slightest credence. They will only marvel how a sane man could have uttered such egregious folly. <span class="cmt_word">Cry ye out, and cry</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "Blind yourselves, and be blind," which certainly gives a much better sense, and is justified by the use of the same verb in <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>. As Pharaoh began by hardening his own heart, and then God hardened it ('Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 103, 166, 203, etc.), so those who blind their own eyes, and will not see when they have the power, are, in the end, if they persist, judicially blinded by God. <span class="cmt_word">They are drunken, but not with wine.</span> "The drunkards of Ephraim" (<a href="/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>) were such literally. They "erred through strong drink" (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>); they "were swallowed up of wine;" but the case was different with the infatuated ones of Judah. They were morally, not physically, intoxicated. Their pride and self-trust rendered them as irrational and as unimpressionable as ever drunkenness rendered any man; but they were not actual drunkards. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy here passes from the fall of Samaria, the crown of flowers (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>), to its formal parallel. Jerusalem takes its place by the side of Samaria, the crown of flowers, and under the emblem of a hearth of God. 'Ar&#305;&#772;'e&#772;l might, indeed, mean a lion of God. It occurs in this sense as the name of certain Moabitish heroes (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>), and Isaiah himself used the shorter form &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; for the heroes of Judah (<a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). But as &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; (God's heart, interchanged with &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; htiw degna, God's height) is the name given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15-16</a>, to the altar of burnt-offering in the new temple, and as Isaiah could not say anything more characteristic of Jerusalem, than that Jehovah had a fire and hearth there (<a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>); and, moreover, as Jerusalem the city and community within the city would have been compared to a lioness rather than a lion, we take &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; in the sense of ara Dei (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, to burn). The prophet commences in his own peculiar way with a grand summary introduction, which passes in a few gigantic strides over the whole course from threatening to promise. <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> "Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the castle where David pitched his tent! Add year to year, let the feasts revolve: then I distress Ariel, and there is groaning and moaning; and so she proves herself to me as Ariel." By the fact that David fixed his headquarters in Jerusalem, and then brought the sacred ark thither, Jerusalem became a hearth of God. Within a single year, after only one more round of feasts (to be interpreted according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>, and probably spoken at the passover), Jehovah would make Jerusalem a besieged city, full of sighs (vaha&#774;ts&#305;&#772;qo&#772;th&#305;&#772;, perf. cons., with the tone upon the ultimate); but "she becomes to me like an Ar&#305;&#772;el," i.e., being qualified through me, she will prove herself a hearth of God, by consuming the foes like a furnace, or by their meeting with their destruction at Jerusalem, like wood piled up on the altar and then consumed in flame. The prophecy has thus passed over the whole ground in a few majestic words. It now starts from the very beginning again, and first of all expands the hoi. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a> "And I encamp in a circle round about thee, and surround thee with watch-posts, and erect tortoises against thee. And when brought down thou wilt speak from out of the ground, and thy speaking will sound low out of the dust; and thy voice cometh up like that of a demon from the ground, and thy speaking will whisper out of the dust." It would have to go so far with Ariel first of all, that it would be besieged by a hostile force, and would lie upon the ground in the greatest extremity, and then would whisper with a ghostlike softness, like a dying man, or like a spirit without flesh and bones. Kaddu&#772;r signifies sphaera, orbis, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a> and in the Talmud (from ka&#770;dar  equals  ka&#770;thar; cf., kudur in the name Nabu-kudur-ussur, Nebo protect the crown, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and is used here poetically for &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. Jerome renders it quasi sphaeram (from du&#772;r, orbis). &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1497;&#1510;&#1489;) might signify "firmly planted" (Luzzatto, immobilmente; compare shu&#772;th, <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but according to the parallel it signifies a military post, like &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1489;. Metsuro&#772;th (from ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>) are instruments of siege, the nature of which can only be determined conjecturally. On 'o&#772;bh, see <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>;<p>(Note: The 'akkuubh mentioned there is equivalent to anbu&#770;b, Arab. a knot on a reed stalk, then that part of such a reed which comes between two knots, then the reed stalk itself; root &#1504;&#1489;, to rise up, swell, or become convex without and concave within (Fl.). It is possible that it would be better to trace 'o&#772;bh back to this radical and primary meaning of what is hollow (and therefore has a dull sound), whether used in the sense of a leather-bag, or applied to a spirit of incantation, and the possessor of such a spirit.)<p>there is no necessity to take it as standing for ba&#8219;al 'o&#772;bh. </body></html>
