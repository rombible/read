The Assyrians had swallowed up Jerusalem in their imagination: but God would suddenly disappoint all their hopes, and send them away empty and confounded. For, the reader will observe, “Sennacherib and his mighty army are not here compared to a dream, because of their sudden disappearance; but the disappointment of their eager hopes is compared to what happens to a hungry and thirsty man, when he awakes from a dream, in which fancy had presented to him meat and drink in abundance, and finds it nothing but a vain illusion.

Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold.

The comparison is elegant and beautiful in the highest degree. It is performed up to great perfection; and is perfectly suited to illustrate the object in view. The same image substantially is found in the classic writers; and this, says Lowth, may, for beauty and ingenuity, fairly come in competition with one of the most elegant of Virgil (greatly improved from Homer, "Iliad" xxii. 119), where he has applied to a different purpose, but not so happily, the same image of the ineffectual workings of the imagination in a dream:<p>Ac veluti in somnis oculos ubi languida pressit<p>Nocte quies, nequicquam avidos extendere cursus<p>Velle videmur, et in mediis conatibus aegri<p>Succidimus; non lingua valet, non corpore notae<p>Sufficiunt vires; nec, vox, nec verba scquuniur.<p>AEniad xii. 908.<p>And as when slumber seals the closing sight,<p>The sick wild fancy labors in the night,<p>Some dreadful visionary foe we shun,<p>With airy strides, but strive in vain to run;<p>In vain our baffled limbs their powers essay,<p>We faint, we struggle, sink, and fall away;<p>Drained of our strength we neither fight nor fly,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Some interpret this of the disappointment of Sennacherib's army; and others of the insatiable cruelty of the Chaldeans; but rather, if the above sense pleases not, it would be better to understand it of the Jews, who, amidst their greatest danger, flattered themselves with the hope of deliverance, which was all a dream and an illusion; and to which sense the following words seem to incline. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It shall even be as when an hungry <i>man</i> dreameth, and, behold, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, <i>he is</i> faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</span><p>(g) That is, he thinks that he eats.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">dreameth, and behold</span>] The invariable formula in narrating a dream; <a href="/genesis/40-9.htm" title="And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;">Genesis 40:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/40-16.htm" title="When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:">Genesis 40:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.">Genesis 41:1</a> ff.; <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm" title="You, O king, saw, and behold a great image.

The melting away of the vision would involve a keen disappointment. The enemies of Israel had expected to secure a most valuable prey. They had dreamed of a rich booty when they should take the city - a booty which would reward them for all the hardships of their marches, their watches, their toils in the siege, the dangers to which they exposed themselves in the assaults. It was as if a hungry man had dreamed that he was engaged in a feast, or a thirsty man that he was drinking deep at a banquet, when suddenly he wakes up, and finds that he has been merely dreaming, and that there is no reality in his fancies. Dr. Kay quotes a passage which is much to the point from Mungo Park's journals: "No sooner had I shut my eyes than fancy would convey me to the streams and rivers of my native land. There, as I wandered along the verdant bank, I surveyed the clear streams with transport, and hastened to swallow the delightful draught; but, alas! disappointment awaked me, and I found myself a lonely captive, perishing of thirst amid the wilds of Africa." Those engaged in the siege, while themselves vanishing away, would likewise find their dreams of plunder vanish, and Would bitterly feel the disappointment. <span class="cmt_word">That fight against Mount Zion.</span> To attack Jerusalem was to fight against the mount of God, the place where Jehovah had "set his Name, "and where he condescended in some true sense to <span class="accented">dwell</span> continually. How could those who engaged in such an enterprise hope to succeed? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy here passes from the fall of Samaria, the crown of flowers (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>), to its formal parallel. Jerusalem takes its place by the side of Samaria, the crown of flowers, and under the emblem of a hearth of God. 'Ar&#305;&#772;'e&#772;l might, indeed, mean a lion of God. It occurs in this sense as the name of certain Moabitish heroes (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>), and Isaiah himself used the shorter form &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; for the heroes of Judah (<a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). But as &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; (God's heart, interchanged with &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; htiw degna, God's height) is the name given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15-16</a>, to the altar of burnt-offering in the new temple, and as Isaiah could not say anything more characteristic of Jerusalem, than that Jehovah had a fire and hearth there (<a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>); and, moreover, as Jerusalem the city and community within the city would have been compared to a lioness rather than a lion, we take &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; in the sense of ara Dei (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, to burn). The prophet commences in his own peculiar way with a grand summary introduction, which passes in a few gigantic strides over the whole course from threatening to promise. <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> "Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the castle where David pitched his tent! Add year to year, let the feasts revolve: then I distress Ariel, and there is groaning and moaning; and so she proves herself to me as Ariel." By the fact that David fixed his headquarters in Jerusalem, and then brought the sacred ark thither, Jerusalem became a hearth of God. Within a single year, after only one more round of feasts (to be interpreted according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>, and probably spoken at the passover), Jehovah would make Jerusalem a besieged city, full of sighs (vaha&#774;ts&#305;&#772;qo&#772;th&#305;&#772;, perf. cons., with the tone upon the ultimate); but "she becomes to me like an Ar&#305;&#772;el," i.e., being qualified through me, she will prove herself a hearth of God, by consuming the foes like a furnace, or by their meeting with their destruction at Jerusalem, like wood piled up on the altar and then consumed in flame. The prophecy has thus passed over the whole ground in a few majestic words. It now starts from the very beginning again, and first of all expands the hoi. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a> "And I encamp in a circle round about thee, and surround thee with watch-posts, and erect tortoises against thee. And when brought down thou wilt speak from out of the ground, and thy speaking will sound low out of the dust; and thy voice cometh up like that of a demon from the ground, and thy speaking will whisper out of the dust." It would have to go so far with Ariel first of all, that it would be besieged by a hostile force, and would lie upon the ground in the greatest extremity, and then would whisper with a ghostlike softness, like a dying man, or like a spirit without flesh and bones. Kaddu&#772;r signifies sphaera, orbis, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a> and in the Talmud (from ka&#770;dar  equals  ka&#770;thar; cf., kudur in the name Nabu-kudur-ussur, Nebo protect the crown, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and is used here poetically for &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. Jerome renders it quasi sphaeram (from du&#772;r, orbis). &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1497;&#1510;&#1489;) might signify "firmly planted" (Luzzatto, immobilmente; compare shu&#772;th, <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but according to the parallel it signifies a military post, like &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1489;. Metsuro&#772;th (from ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>) are instruments of siege, the nature of which can only be determined conjecturally. On 'o&#772;bh, see <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>;<p>(Note: The 'akkuubh mentioned there is equivalent to anbu&#770;b, Arab. a knot on a reed stalk, then that part of such a reed which comes between two knots, then the reed stalk itself; root &#1504;&#1489;, to rise up, swell, or become convex without and concave within (Fl.). It is possible that it would be better to trace 'o&#772;bh back to this radical and primary meaning of what is hollow (and therefore has a dull sound), whether used in the sense of a leather-bag, or applied to a spirit of incantation, and the possessor of such a spirit.)<p>there is no necessity to take it as standing for ba&#8219;al 'o&#772;bh. </body></html>
