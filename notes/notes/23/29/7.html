Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall.

So it was with the Assyrian. He had set his heart on the wealth of Jerusalem. He had earnestly desired to possess that city - as a hungry man desires to satisfy the cravings of his appetite. But it would be like the vision of the night; and on that fatal morning on which he should awake from his fond dream <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, he would find all his hopes dissipated, and the longcherished desire of his soul unsatisfied still. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. munition&#8212;fortress.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Wherein it shall be so is explained in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,....

Jerusalem takes its place by the side of Samaria, the crown of flowers, and under the emblem of a hearth of God. 'Ar&#305;&#772;'e&#772;l might, indeed, mean a lion of God. It occurs in this sense as the name of certain Moabitish heroes (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>), and Isaiah himself used the shorter form &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; for the heroes of Judah (<a href="/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). But as &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; (God's heart, interchanged with &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; htiw degna, God's height) is the name given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15-16</a>, to the altar of burnt-offering in the new temple, and as Isaiah could not say anything more characteristic of Jerusalem, than that Jehovah had a fire and hearth there (<a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>); and, moreover, as Jerusalem the city and community within the city would have been compared to a lioness rather than a lion, we take &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; in the sense of ara Dei (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, to burn). The prophet commences in his own peculiar way with a grand summary introduction, which passes in a few gigantic strides over the whole course from threatening to promise. <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> "Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the castle where David pitched his tent! Add year to year, let the feasts revolve: then I distress Ariel, and there is groaning and moaning; and so she proves herself to me as Ariel." By the fact that David fixed his headquarters in Jerusalem, and then brought the sacred ark thither, Jerusalem became a hearth of God. Within a single year, after only one more round of feasts (to be interpreted according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>, and probably spoken at the passover), Jehovah would make Jerusalem a besieged city, full of sighs (vaha&#774;ts&#305;&#772;qo&#772;th&#305;&#772;, perf. cons., with the tone upon the ultimate); but "she becomes to me like an Ar&#305;&#772;el," i.e., being qualified through me, she will prove herself a hearth of God, by consuming the foes like a furnace, or by their meeting with their destruction at Jerusalem, like wood piled up on the altar and then consumed in flame. The prophecy has thus passed over the whole ground in a few majestic words. It now starts from the very beginning again, and first of all expands the hoi. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a> "And I encamp in a circle round about thee, and surround thee with watch-posts, and erect tortoises against thee. And when brought down thou wilt speak from out of the ground, and thy speaking will sound low out of the dust; and thy voice cometh up like that of a demon from the ground, and thy speaking will whisper out of the dust." It would have to go so far with Ariel first of all, that it would be besieged by a hostile force, and would lie upon the ground in the greatest extremity, and then would whisper with a ghostlike softness, like a dying man, or like a spirit without flesh and bones. Kaddu&#772;r signifies sphaera, orbis, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a> and in the Talmud (from ka&#770;dar  equals  ka&#770;thar; cf., kudur in the name Nabu-kudur-ussur, Nebo protect the crown, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and is used here poetically for &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. Jerome renders it quasi sphaeram (from du&#772;r, orbis). &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; (from &#1504;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1497;&#1510;&#1489;) might signify "firmly planted" (Luzzatto, immobilmente; compare shu&#772;th, <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but according to the parallel it signifies a military post, like &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1489;. Metsuro&#772;th (from ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>) are instruments of siege, the nature of which can only be determined conjecturally. On 'o&#772;bh, see <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>;<p>(Note: The 'akkuubh mentioned there is equivalent to anbu&#770;b, Arab. a knot on a reed stalk, then that part of such a reed which comes between two knots, then the reed stalk itself; root &#1504;&#1489;, to rise up, swell, or become convex without and concave within (Fl.). It is possible that it would be better to trace 'o&#772;bh back to this radical and primary meaning of what is hollow (and therefore has a dull sound), whether used in the sense of a leather-bag, or applied to a spirit of incantation, and the possessor of such a spirit.)<p>there is no necessity to take it as standing for ba&#8219;al 'o&#772;bh. </body></html>
