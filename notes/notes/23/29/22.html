When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - In consequence of the happy change which shall take place in the nation when the oppressor shall be removed <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20-21</a>, and when the poor and the meek shall rejoice <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>, and the ignorant shall be instructed <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>, Jacob shall not be ashamed of his descendants as he was before, nor have cause to blush in regard to his posterity.<p>Who redeemed Abraham - That is, who brought him out of a land of idolaters, and rescued him from the abominations of idolatry. The word 'redeem,' here (&#1508;&#1491;&#1492;  pa&#770;da&#770;h), properly denotes "to ransom, that is, to redeem a captive, or a prisoner with a price paid <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a>. But it is also used as meaning to deliver in general, without reference to a price, to free in any manner, to recover <a href="/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-29.htm">1 Kings 1:29</a>; <a href="/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/71-23.htm">Psalm 71:23</a>. It is used in this general sense here; and means that Yahweh had rescued Abraham from the evils of idolatry, and made him his friend. The connection, also, would seem to imply that there was a reference to the promise which was made to Abraham that he should have a numerous posterity (see <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>).<p>Jacob shall not now be ashamed - This is a poetical introduction of Jacob as the ancestor of the Jewish people, as if the venerable patriarch were looking upon his children. Their deportment had been such as would suffuse a father's cheeks with shame; henceforward in the reformation that would occur he would "not" be ashamed of them, but would look on them with approbation.<p>Neither shall his face wax pale - The face usually becomes pale with fear: but this may also occur from any strong emotion. Disappointment may produce paleness as well as fear; and perhaps the idea may be that the face of Jacob should no more become pallid as "if" he had been disappointed in regard to the hopes which he had cherished of his sons. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

God's directions to Abraham to remove from a land of idolaters (<a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2, 3</a>; <a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2, 3</a>) were practically a "deliverance."

"Woe unto them that hide plans deep from Jehovah, and their doing occurs in a dark place, and they say, Who saw us then, and who knew about us? Oh for your perversity! It is to be regarded as potters' clay; that a work could say to its maker, He has not made me; and an image to its sculptor, He does not understand it!" Just as Ahaz had carefully kept his appeal to Asshur for help secret from the prophet; so did they try, as far as possible, to hide from the prophet the plan for an alliance with Egypt. &#1500;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is a syncopated hiphil for &#1500;&#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-11.htm">Isaiah 23:11</a>. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1511; adds the adverbial notion, according to our mode of expression (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>, and the opposite thought in <a href="/joel/2-26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>; Ges. 142). To hide from Jehovah is equivalent to hiding from the prophet of Jehovah, that they might not have to listen to reproof from the word of Jehovah. We may see from <a href="/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12</a> how suspiciously they watched the prophet in such circumstances as these. But Jehovah saw them in their secrecy, and the prophet saw through the whole in the light of Jehovah. &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; is an exclamation, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>. They are perverse, or ('im) "is it not so?" They think they can dispense with Jehovah, and yet they are His creatures; they attribute cleverness to themselves, and practically disown Jehovah, as if the pot should say to the potter who has turned it, He does not understand it. </body></html>
