The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the book is delivered ... - That is, they are just as ignorant of the true nature and meaning of the revelations of God as a man is of the contents of a book who is utterly unable to read. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. The unlearned succeed no better than the learned, not from want of human learning, as they fancy, but from not having the teaching of God (Isa 54:13; Jer 31:34; Joh 6:45; 1Co 2:7-10; 1Jo 2:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The vision of all; </span> of all your prophets, whether the true or false ones. <span class="ital">As the words of a book that is sealed</span>; in which no man can read whilst it is scaled up, as books then sometimes were, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm" title="So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.">1 Kings 21:8</a> <a href="/esther/3-12.htm" title="Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.">Esther 3:12</a>,13</span>, being made in the form of rolls, which was convenient for that purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The book is delivered to him that is not learned; </span> unsealed and opened, as the following clause implies.

In short, the sum of it is this, that neither the learned nor unlearned, among the Jews, cared to read their Bibles, or to search the Scriptures, and the prophecies in them, concerning the Messiah, and that neither of them understood them; these things were hid from the wise and prudent, as well as from the ignorant and unlearned of the people, in common, and were only made known to a few babes and sucklings. There was great ignorance of the Scriptures in the times of Christ, to which these passages truly belong, <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>. <p>(w) "nunc", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that is not learned</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that cannot read writing." Even in our Lord's day the ordinary Jew was not taught to read and write.

Now follows an unfolding of the words of promise, which stand at the end of <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> : "And it proves itself to me as Ariel." <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-8</a> : "And the multitude of thy foes will become like finely powdered dust, and the multitude of the tyrants like chaff flying away; and it will take place suddenly, very suddenly. From Jehovah of hosts there comes a visitation with crash of thunder and earthquake and great noise, whirlwind and tempest, and the blazing up of devouring fire. And the multitude of all the nations that gather together against Ariel, and all those who storm and distress Ariel and her stronghold, will be like a vision of the night in a dream. And it is just as a hungry man dreams, and behold he eats; and when he wakes up his soul is empty: and just as a thirsty man dreams, and behold he drinks; and when he wakes up, behold, he is faint, and his soul is parched with thirst: so will it be to the multitude of the nations which gather together against the mountain of Zion." The hostile army, described four times as ha&#770;mo&#772;n, a groaning multitude, is utterly annihilated through the terrible co-operation of the forces of nature which are let loose upon them (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). "There comes a visitation:" tippa&#770;qe&#772;d might refer to Jerusalem in the sense of "it will be visited" in mercy, viz., by Jehovah acting thus upon its enemies. But it is better to take it in a neuter sense: "punishment is inflicted." The simile of the dream is applied in two different ways: (1.) They will dissolve into nothing, as if they had only the same apparent existence as a vision in a dream. (2.) Their plan for taking Jerusalem will be put to shame, and as utterly brought to nought as the eating or drinking of a dreamer, which turns out to be a delusion as soon as he awakes. Just as the prophet emphatically combines two substantives from the same verbal root in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, and two adverbs from the same verb in <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>; so does he place &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; and &#1510;&#1489;&#1492; together in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, the former with &#1506;&#1500; relating to the crowding of an army for the purpose of a siege, the latter with an objective suffix (compare <a href="/psalms/53-6.htm">Psalm 53:6</a>) to the attack made by a crowded army. The metso&#772;da&#770;h of Ariel (i.e., the watch-tower, specula, from tsu&#772;d, to spy)<p>(Note: In Arabic, also, masa&#770;d signifies a lofty hill or mountain-top, from a secondary form of tsud; and massara, to lay the foundations of a fortified city (&#8219;&#305;&#772;r ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>), from tsu&#772;r.))<p>is the mountain of Zion mentioned afterwards in <a href="/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as if; comp. <a href="/zechariah/10-6.htm">Zechariah 10:6</a>; <a href="/job/10-19.htm">Job 10:19</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; without &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; the personal pronoun is frequently omitted, not only in the leading participial clause, as in this instance (compare <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; and Khler on <a href="/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), but also with a minor participial clause, as in <a href="/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>, and <a href="/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. The hungering and thirsting of the waking man are attributed to his nephesh (soul: cf., <a href="/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), just because the soul is the cause of the physical life, and without it the action of the senses would be followed by no sensation or experience whatever. The hungry stomach is simply the object of feeling, and everything sensitive in the bodily organism is merely the medium of sensation or feeling; that which really feels is the soul. The soul no sooner passes out of the dreaming state into a waking condition, than it feels that its desires are as unsatisfied as ever. Just like such a dream will the army of the enemy, and that victory of which it is so certain before the battle is fought, fade away into nothing. </body></html>
