When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all.

Lowth renders this singularly enough:<p>'Who bewildered the poor man in speaking.'<p>Grotius supposes it means, 'Who on account of the word of God, that is, the true prophecy, treat men as guilty of crime.' Calvin supposes it means, 'Who bear with impatience the reproofs and denunciation of the prophets, and who endeavor to pervert and distort their meaning.' Hence, he supposes, they proposed artful and captious questions by which they might ensnare them. Others suppose that it refers to the fact that they led people into sin by their new doctrines and false views. The connection, however, seems to require that it should be understood of judicial proceedings, and the sense is probably correctly expressed by Noyes:<p>'Who condemned the poor man in his cause.'<p>This interpretation is also that which is proposed by Rosenmuller and Gesenius. According to the interpretation above suggested, the word rendered 'who make an offender,' means the same as who holds one guilty, that is, condemns.<p>A man - (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;  'a&#770;da&#770;m). It is well known that this word stands in contradistinction to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  '&#305;&#770;ysh, and denotes usually a poor man, a man in humble life, in opposition to one who is rich or of more elevated rank. This is probably the sense here, and the meaning is, that they condemned the poor man; that is, that they were partial in their judgments.<p>For a word - (&#1489;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  beda&#770;ba&#770;r). "In" a word; denoting the same as "a cause" that is tried before a court of justice. So <a href="/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a> : 'When they have "a matter" (&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;  da&#770;ba&#770;r "a word"), they come unto me.' So <a href="/exodus/18-22.htm">Exodus 18:22</a> : 'And it shoji be that every great "matter" (Hebrew every great "word") that they shall bring unto me.' So <a href="/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8</a> (in the English version 9): 'For all manner of trespass,' Hebrew for every word of trespass; that is, for every suit concerning a breach of trust. So also <a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a> : 'If any man have "any matters" to do,' (Hebrew, 'any "words, '") that is, if anyone has a law suit.<p>And lay a snare - To lay a snare is to devise a plan to deceive, or get into their possession; as birds are caught in snares that are concealed from their view.<p>That reproveth - Or rather, that "contended" or "pleaded;" that is, that had a cause. The word &#1497;&#1499;&#1495;  ya&#770;kach means often to contend with any one; to strive; to seek to confute; to attempt to defend or justify, as in a court of law <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/job/19-5.htm">Job 19:5</a>; <a href="/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a>.

Inadvertently spoken, unwarily dropped, without any bad design or ill meaning; or for a word misplaced or misconstrued; or for preaching and professing the word of God, the Gospel of salvation, and adhering to it; which is the true character of the persecutors of good men in all ages: some render the words, "who make a man sin by a word" (e); by their words and doctrines; and so apply it to the false prophets, as Jarchi does; and very well agrees with the Pharisees in Christ's time, who made men to sin, to transgress the word of God, by their traditions. The Targum is, <p>"who condemn the sons of men by their words;'' <p>or for them; particularly for their words of reproof, for which they make them offenders, or pronounce them guilty, as follows: <p>and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate; either for just judges, who sat in the gate of the city, and faithfully reproved and punished men for their sins; or for such that had boldness and courage enough to reprove wicked men openly, and before all, for their wickedness, the gate being a public place, where people pass and repass; and such that sin openly should be reproved openly; and particularly the true prophets of the Lord may be referred to, who sometimes were sent to publish their messages, which were frequently reproofs of the people, in the gates of the city; but, above all, Christ seems to be respected, who in the most public manner inveighed against the Scribes and Pharisees for their wickedness, on account of which they sought to entangle him in his talk, and to lay snares for his life; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>, <p>and turn aside the just for a thing of nought; the Targum is, <p>"that falsely pervert the judgment of the innocent;'' <p>that turn away their judgment, decline doing them justice, but condemn them on frivolous pretences, for just nothing at all, what is mere emptiness and vanity: Christ is eminently the "just" One, righteous in himself, and the author of righteousness to others; yet, on account of things for which there were no foundation, and contrary to all justice, he was proceeded against as a criminal. <p>(e)   "qui verbie faciunt ut peccent homines", Castalio; "peccare facientes hominem in verbo", Pagninus, Montanus.

"Woe unto them that hide plans deep from Jehovah, and their doing occurs in a dark place, and they say, Who saw us then, and who knew about us? Oh for your perversity! It is to be regarded as potters' clay; that a work could say to its maker, He has not made me; and an image to its sculptor, He does not understand it!" Just as Ahaz had carefully kept his appeal to Asshur for help secret from the prophet; so did they try, as far as possible, to hide from the prophet the plan for an alliance with Egypt. &#1500;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is a syncopated hiphil for &#1500;&#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-11.htm">Isaiah 23:11</a>. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1511; adds the adverbial notion, according to our mode of expression (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>, and the opposite thought in <a href="/joel/2-26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>; Ges. 142). To hide from Jehovah is equivalent to hiding from the prophet of Jehovah, that they might not have to listen to reproof from the word of Jehovah. We may see from <a href="/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12</a> how suspiciously they watched the prophet in such circumstances as these. But Jehovah saw them in their secrecy, and the prophet saw through the whole in the light of Jehovah. &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; is an exclamation, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>. They are perverse, or ('im) "is it not so?" They think they can dispense with Jehovah, and yet they are His creatures; they attribute cleverness to themselves, and practically disown Jehovah, as if the pot should say to the potter who has turned it, He does not understand it. </body></html>
