Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all.

The prophet received it by revelation of Jehovah; and without the illumination of Jehovah it could not possibly be understood. The deep degradation of Ariel, the wonderful deliverance, the sudden elevation from the abyss to this lofty height - all this was a matter of faith. But this faith was just what the nation wanted, and therefore the understanding depending upon it was wanting also. The shemu&#8219;a&#770;h was there, but the b&#305;&#772;na&#770;h was absent; and all &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; was wrecked on the obtuseness of the mass. The prophet, therefore, who had received the unhappy calling to harden his people, could not help exclaiming (<a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>), "Stop, and stare; blind yourselves, and grow blind!" &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, to show one's self delaying (from &#1502;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468;, according to Luzzatto the reflective of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, an emphatic form which is never met with), is connected with the synonymous verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, to be stiff with astonishment; but to &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, to be plastered up, i.e., incapable of seeing (cf., <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>), there is attached the hithpalpel of the same verb, signifying "to place one's self in such circumstances," se oblinere (differently, however, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-16.htm">Psalm 119:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-47.htm">Psalm 119:47</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>, se permulcere). They could not understand the word of God, but they were confused, and their eyes were, so to speak, festered up: therefore this self-induced condition would become to them a God-appointed punishment. The imperatives are judicial words of command.<p>This growth of the self-hardening into a judicial sentence of obduracy, is proclaimed still more fully by the prophet. "They are drunken, and not with wine; they reel, and not with meth. For Jehovah hath poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and bound up your eyes; the prophets and your heads, the seers, He has veiled. And the revelation of all this will be to you like words of a sealed writing, which they give to him who understands writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I cannot, it is sealed. And they give the writing to one who does not understand writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I do not understand writing." They were drunken and stupid; not, however, merely because they gave themselves up to sensual intoxication (&#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, dependent upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, ebrii vino), but because Jehovah had given them up to spiritual confusion and self-destruction. All the punishments of God are inflicted through the medium of His no less world-destroying than world-sustaining Spirit, which, although not willing what is evil, does make the evil called into existence by the creature the means of punishing evil. Tarde&#772;ma&#770;h is used here to signify the powerless, passive state of utter spiritual insensibility. This judgment had fallen upon the nation in all its members, even upon the eyes and heads of the nation, i.e., the prophets. Even they whose duty is was to see to the good of the nation, and lead it, were blind leaders of the blind; their eyes were fast shut (&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;, the intensive form of the kal, <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; Aram. &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;; Talmud also &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;: to shut the eyes, or press them close), and over their heads a cover was drawn, as over sleepers in the night. Since the time of Koppe and Eichhorn it has become a usual thing to regard &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; as a gloss, and indeed as a false one (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13-14</a>); but the reason assigned - namely, that Isaiah's polemics are directed not against the prophets, but against the stupid staring people - is utterly groundless (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, and the polemics of his contemporary Micah, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5-8</a>). Moreover, the author of a gloss would have been more likely to interpret &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; by &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (compare <a href="/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>). And <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/29-12.htm">Isaiah 29:12</a> are also opposed to this assumption of a gloss. For by those who understood what was written (se&#772;pher), it is evident that the prophets and rulers of the nation are intended; and by those who did not understand it, the great mass of the people. To both of them, "the vision of all," i.e., of all and everything that God had shown to His true prophets, was by the judgment of God completely sealed. Some of them might have an outward knowledge; but the inward understanding of the revelation was sealed to them. Some had not even this, but stared at the word of the prophet, just as a man who cannot read stares at what is written. The chethib has &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;; the keri &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, though without any ground, since the article is merely generic. Instead of &#1504;&#1488;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, we should write &#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; in both cases, as certain codices and old editions do. </body></html>
