"The words are so moulded as to point us specially to the person of the Son of God, who 'saves' us; as He vouchsafed to Israel temporal saving, so to His elect He appears for the purpose of conferring eternal salvation" [Vitringa].

The heading in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm" title="And it shall be said in that day, See, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.">Isaiah 25:9</a></span> marks this as a distinct section. It might indeed be supposed, from the phrase “in this mountain” in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a></span>, and the use of future tenses in 10–12, that the song of praise ends with <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm" title="And it shall be said in that day, See, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.">Isaiah 25:9</a></span> and that 10–12 are the continuation of <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm" title="He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 25:8</a></span>. But this is unlikely. The express naming of Moab is not in the manner of the main apocalyptic prophecy, while to take Moab as a symbolic name for the enemies of God in general is hazardous, as being opposed to Old Testament usage. The violent contrast between the spirit of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined....">Isaiah 25:6-8</a></span> and that of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill....">Isaiah 25:10-12</a></span> rather favours the supposition that the latter was a separate composition. In any event, we must assume that so passionate an outburst of indignation against Moab was called forth by some special circumstance, although it is not possible to connect it with any known historic occasion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - After thanksgiving for deliverance in the past, and commemoration of blessings in the present, confidence is expressed in the future. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The redeemed declare their joy that they have "waited for God," trusted in him, and looked to him for salvation.

The prophet, whom we already know as a psalmist from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>, now acts as choral leader of the church of the future, and praises Jehovah for having destroyed the mighty imperial city, and proved Himself a defence and shield against its tyranny towards His oppressed church. "Jehovah, Thou art my God; I will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name, that Thou hast wrought wonders, counsels from afar, sincerity, truth. For Thou hast turned it from a city into a heap of stones, the steep castle into a ruin; the palace of the barbarians from being a city, to be rebuilt no more for ever. Therefore a wild people will honour Thee, cities of violent nations fear Thee. For Thou provedst Thyself a stronghold to the lowly, a stronghold to the poor in his distress, as a shelter from the storm of rain, as a shadow from the burning of the sun; for the blast of violent ones was like a storm of rain against a wall. Like the burning of the sun in a parched land, Thou subduest the noise of the barbarians; (like) the burning of the sun through the shadow of a cloud, the triumphal song of violent ones was brought low." The introductory clause is to be understood as in <a href="/psalms/118-28.htm">Psalm 118:28</a> : Jehovah (voc.), my God art Thou. "Thou hast wrought wonders:" this is taken from <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> (as in <a href="/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>; like <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>). The wonders which are now actually wrought are "counsels from afar" (me&#772;ra&#770;co&#772;k), counsels already adopted afar off, i.e., long before, thoughts of God belonging to the olden time; the same ideal view as in <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a> (a parallel which coincides with our passage on every side), and, in fact, throughout the whole of the second part. It is the manifold "counsel" of the Holy One of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/19-17.htm">Isaiah 19:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>) which displays its wonders in the events of time. To the verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; we have also a second and third object, viz., &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;. It is a common custom with Isaiah to place derivatives of the same word side by side, for the purpose of giving the greatest possible emphasis to the idea (<a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>). &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; indicates a quality, &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; in actual fact. What He has executed is the realization of His faithfulness, and the reality of His promises. The imperial city is destroyed. Jehovah, as the first clause which is defined by tzakeph affirms, has removed it away from the nature of a city into the condition of a heap of stones. The sentence has its object within itself, and merely gives prominence to the change that has been effected; the Lamed is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>); the min, as in <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a>. Mappe&#772;la&#770;h, with kametz or tzere before the tone, is a word that can only be accredited from the book of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; are common parallel words in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>); and za&#770;rim, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, is the most general epithet for the enemies of the people of God. The fall of the imperial kingdom is followed by the conversion of the heathen; the songs proceed from the mouths of the remotest nations. <a href="/isaiah/25-3.htm">Isaiah 25:3</a> runs parallel with <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3-4</a>. Nations hitherto rude and passionate now submit to Jehovah with decorous reverence, and those that were previously oppressive (&#8219;ar&#305;&#772;tzim, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>, in form like pa&#770;r&#305;&#772;tzim, sha&#770;l&#305;&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m) with humble fear. The cause of this conversion of the heathen is the one thus briefly indicated in the Apocalypse, "for thy judgments are made manifest" (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (cf., <a href="/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>) are names well known from the Psalms, as applying to the church when oppressed. To this church, in the distress which she had endured (&#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>), Jehovah had proved Himself a strong castle (ma&#770;'o&#772;z; on the expression, compare <a href="/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>), a shelter from storm and a shade from heat (for the figures, compare <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-3.htm">Isaiah 16:3</a>), so that the blast of the tyrants (compare ruach on <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/76-13.htm">Psalm 76:13</a>) was like a wall-storm, i.e., a storm striking against a wall (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>, a shoulder-stick, i.e., a stick which strikes the shoulder), sounding against it and bursting upon it without being able to wash it away (<a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>), because it was the wall of a strong castle, and this strong castle was Jehovah Himself. As Jehovah can suddenly subdue the heat of the sun in dryness (tza&#770;yo&#772;n, abstract for concrete, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, equivalent to dry land, <a href="/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>), and it must give way when He brings up a shady thicket (<a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>), namely of clouds (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>), so did He suddenly subdue the thundering (sha&#770;'on, as in <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>) of the hordes that stormed against His people; and the song of triumph (za&#770;m&#305;&#772;r, only met with again in Sol 2:12) of the tyrants, which passed over the world like a scorching heat, was soon "brought low" (&#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h, in its neuter radical signification "to bend," related to &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;, as in <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>). </body></html>
