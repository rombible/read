The inscription of the Moabite stone, in connection with Isaiah 15, helps to explain the nature of the allusion. Moab had been prominent among the enemies of Israel; the claims of Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been set up against those of Jehovah, the God of Israel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 166), and so the name had become representative of His enemies. There was a mystical Moab, as there was afterwards a mystical Babylon, and in Rabbinic writings a mystical Edom (i.e., Rome). The proud nation was to lie wallowing in the mire of shame, trampled on by its s on the threshing-floor is trampled by the oxen till it looks like a heap of dung. In the Hebrew word for “dunghill” (<span class= "ital">madmēnah</span>) we may probably trace a reference to the Moabite city of that name (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), in which Isaiah sees an unconscious prophecy of the future condition of the whole nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">For in this mountain </span>— In the gospel church; (he alludes to mount Zion, which was a type of it;) <span class="ital">shall the hand of the Lord rest </span>— His powerful and gracious presence (which is often signified in Scripture by God’s hand) shall have its constant and settled abode: it shall not move from place to place, as it formerly did, with the tabernacle; nor shall it depart as it did from Jerusalem, but shall continue in his church, even to the end of the world, <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds.

By the expression that the hand of Yahweh should REST on mount Zion, is meant probably that be would be its defender; his protection would not be withdrawn, but would be permanent there. For an illustration of the phrase, see a similar use of the word hand as denoting protection, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, <a href="/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>.<p>And Moab - (For an account of Moab, see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1-14</a>.) Moab here seems to be used in a general sense to denote the enemies of God, a and the declaration that it would be trodden down seems designed to indicate that the foes of God and his people would all be destroyed (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>)<p>Under him - The Chaldee renders this, 'In his own place.' The phrase has the sense of 'in his place,' in <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>. Here it may mean that Moab, or the enemies of God, would be trodden down and destroyed in their own land.<p>As straw is trodden down for the dunghill - As straw is suffered to lie in the yard where cattle lie, to be trodden down by them for the purpose of making manure. Lowth renders this,<p>'As the straw is threshed under the wheels of the car.'<p>The Septuagint renders it in the same way. Lowth supposes that there has been an error in transcribing the Hebrew text, and that the former reading was &#1502;&#1491;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; instead of &#1502;&#1491;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;. But there is not the slightest evidence from the MSS that any such mistake has occurred. Nor is it necessary to suppose it.

By Moab the enemies of the church are meant, and is put for them all, even all the antichristian powers, both Turks and Papists; their ruin is expressed by treading down or threshing, in allusion to the threshing of corn, as the word used mostly signifies, when the straw is bruised by the cartwheel, or the feet of oxen; or to the treading of straw in the mire, as follows: <p>even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill; or in "it" (m); or "in the waters of the dunghill" (n), as the Cetib; where being cast and trodden, it rots, and becomes dung; and so the Targum, <p>"as straw is trodden in the clay;'' <p>Jarchi interprets it to this sense.

The protecting hand of God will ever be stretched out over the spiritual Zion - the Church of the Redeemed  - to defend it and keep it safe throughout eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Moab shall be trodden down</span>. Various reasons have been given for the selection of Moab to represent the enemies of the redeemed. Perhaps, as the Moabites were, on the whole, the bitterest of all the adversaries of the Jews (see <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>), they are regarded as the fittest representatives of the human adversaries of God. <span class="cmt_word">For the dung-hill</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the water of a dung-pit</span>. The image is, perhaps, selected with conscious reference to <a href="/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, where the psalmist prays that the "children of Lot" and their helpers may become "as the dung of the earth" (ver. 10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first echo is <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1-8</a>, or more precisely <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1-5</a>. The prophet, whom we already know as a psalmist from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>, now acts as choral leader of the church of the future, and praises Jehovah for having destroyed the mighty imperial city, and proved Himself a defence and shield against its tyranny towards His oppressed church. "Jehovah, Thou art my God; I will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name, that Thou hast wrought wonders, counsels from afar, sincerity, truth. For Thou hast turned it from a city into a heap of stones, the steep castle into a ruin; the palace of the barbarians from being a city, to be rebuilt no more for ever. Therefore a wild people will honour Thee, cities of violent nations fear Thee. For Thou provedst Thyself a stronghold to the lowly, a stronghold to the poor in his distress, as a shelter from the storm of rain, as a shadow from the burning of the sun; for the blast of violent ones was like a storm of rain against a wall. Like the burning of the sun in a parched land, Thou subduest the noise of the barbarians; (like) the burning of the sun through the shadow of a cloud, the triumphal song of violent ones was brought low." The introductory clause is to be understood as in <a href="/psalms/118-28.htm">Psalm 118:28</a> : Jehovah (voc.), my God art Thou. "Thou hast wrought wonders:" this is taken from <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> (as in <a href="/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>; like <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>). The wonders which are now actually wrought are "counsels from afar" (me&#772;ra&#770;co&#772;k), counsels already adopted afar off, i.e., long before, thoughts of God belonging to the olden time; the same ideal view as in <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a> (a parallel which coincides with our passage on every side), and, in fact, throughout the whole of the second part. It is the manifold "counsel" of the Holy One of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/19-17.htm">Isaiah 19:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>) which displays its wonders in the events of time. To the verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; we have also a second and third object, viz., &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;. It is a common custom with Isaiah to place derivatives of the same word side by side, for the purpose of giving the greatest possible emphasis to the idea (<a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>). &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; indicates a quality, &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; in actual fact. What He has executed is the realization of His faithfulness, and the reality of His promises. The imperial city is destroyed. Jehovah, as the first clause which is defined by tzakeph affirms, has removed it away from the nature of a city into the condition of a heap of stones. The sentence has its object within itself, and merely gives prominence to the change that has been effected; the Lamed is used in the same sense as in <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf., <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>); the min, as in <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a>. Mappe&#772;la&#770;h, with kametz or tzere before the tone, is a word that can only be accredited from the book of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; are common parallel words in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>); and za&#770;rim, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, is the most general epithet for the enemies of the people of God. The fall of the imperial kingdom is followed by the conversion of the heathen; the songs proceed from the mouths of the remotest nations. <a href="/isaiah/25-3.htm">Isaiah 25:3</a> runs parallel with <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3-4</a>. Nations hitherto rude and passionate now submit to Jehovah with decorous reverence, and those that were previously oppressive (&#8219;ar&#305;&#772;tzim, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>, in form like pa&#770;r&#305;&#772;tzim, sha&#770;l&#305;&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m) with humble fear. The cause of this conversion of the heathen is the one thus briefly indicated in the Apocalypse, "for thy judgments are made manifest" (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (cf., <a href="/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>) are names well known from the Psalms, as applying to the church when oppressed. To this church, in the distress which she had endured (&#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, cf., <a href="/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>), Jehovah had proved Himself a strong castle (ma&#770;'o&#772;z; on the expression, compare <a href="/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>), a shelter from storm and a shade from heat (for the figures, compare <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-3.htm">Isaiah 16:3</a>), so that the blast of the tyrants (compare ruach on <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/76-13.htm">Psalm 76:13</a>) was like a wall-storm, i.e., a storm striking against a wall (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>, a shoulder-stick, i.e., a stick which strikes the shoulder), sounding against it and bursting upon it without being able to wash it away (<a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>), because it was the wall of a strong castle, and this strong castle was Jehovah Himself. As Jehovah can suddenly subdue the heat of the sun in dryness (tza&#770;yo&#772;n, abstract for concrete, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, equivalent to dry land, <a href="/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>), and it must give way when He brings up a shady thicket (<a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>), namely of clouds (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>), so did He suddenly subdue the thundering (sha&#770;'on, as in <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>) of the hordes that stormed against His people; and the song of triumph (za&#770;m&#305;&#772;r, only met with again in Sol 2:12) of the tyrants, which passed over the world like a scorching heat, was soon "brought low" (&#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h, in its neuter radical signification "to bend," related to &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;, as in <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>). </body></html>
