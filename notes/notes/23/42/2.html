Let our souls rely on him, and rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Father will be well-pleased with us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but rested upon him, and without measure. He patiently bore the contradiction of sinners. His kingdom is spiritual; he was not to appear with earthly honours. He is tender of those oppressed with doubts and fears, as a bruised reed; those who are as smoking flax, as the wick of a lamp newly lighted, which is ready to go out again. He will not despise them, nor lay upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear. By a long course of miracles and his resurrection, he fully showed the truth of his holy religion. By the power of his gospel and grace he fixes principles in the minds of men, which tend to make them wise and just. The most distant nations wait for his law, wait for his gospel, and shall welcome it.

"I have raised up from the north, and he came: from the rising of the sun one who invokes my name; and he treads upon satraps as mud, and like a potter kneadeth clay." The object of the verb ha&#770;&#8219;&#305;&#772;ro&#772;th&#305;&#772; (I have wakened up) is he who came when wakened up by Jehovah from the north and east, i.e., from Media and Persia (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, with evasion of the auxiliary pathach, Ges. 76, 2, c), and, as the second clause affirms, who invokes or will invoke the name of Jehovah (at any rate, qui invocabit is the real meaning of qui invocat). For although the Zarathustrian religion, which Cyrus followed, was nearest to the Jehovah religion of all the systems of heathenism, it was a heathen religion after all. The doctrine of a great God (baga vazarka), the Creator of heaven and earth, and at the same time of a great number of Bagas and Yazatas, behind whose working and worship the great God was thrown into the shade, is (apart from the dualism condemned in <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>) the substance of the sacred writings of the Magi in our possession, as confirmed by the inscriptions of the Achemenides.<p>(Note: Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, pp. 134, 135.)<p>But the awakened of Jehovah would, as is here predicted, "call with the name, or by means of the name, of Jehovah," which may mean either call upon this name (<a href="/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>), or call out the name (compare <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>, with <a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>) in the manner in which he does make use of it in the edict setting the exiles free (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>). The verb &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; which follows (cf., <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) designated him still further as a conqueror of nations; the verb construed with an accusative is used here, as is very frequently the case, in the sense of hostile attack. The word Sa&#770;ga&#770;n, which is met with first in Ezekiel - apart, that is to say, from the passage before us - may have owed its meaning in the Hebrew vocabulary to its similarity in sound to so&#772;khe&#772;n (<a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15</a>); at any rate, it is no doubt a Persian word, which became naturalized in the Hebrew (&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in Athenaeus, and Neo-Pers. sichne, a governor: see Ges. Thes.), though this comparison is by no means so certain<p>(Note: Spiegel has the following remarks upon the subject: There is but very little probability in the etymologies which can be suggested for the word sa&#770;ga&#770;n through the help of the old Persian. The new Persian shihne cannot be traced beyond Neo-Persian, and even there it is somewhat suspicious on account of the h&#803; which it contains, and which is not Persian. The only real Persian word to which I could think of tracing it is shahr, a city (old Bactrian khshathra, or shoithra, a place of abode); or it might possibly have sprung from shoithraka, a supposititious word, in the sense of governor of a district, but with the r changed into n (a change which only occurs in Huzvaresh) and the h into h&#803;. There are also difficulties in the comparison of the old Bactrian canh, to say or express solemnly. An adjective canha&#770;na (expressing, commanding), formed from this verb, would be pronounced canha&#770;na or even ca&#770;na in old Persian; and from this Sa&#770;ga&#770;n would have to be obtained, so that we should still want the n to take the place of the Gimel. At the same time, there is a still harsher form of the root canh in the Gatha dialect, namely cak (not the same as the Sanskrit cak, to be strong, as Haug supposes), though this comparison is by no means so certain, from which the Neo-Persian sachan, sachun, a word, is derived; so that it appears to have been also current in old Persian. Accordingly, the form caka&#770;na may also have been used in the place of canha&#770;na, and this might suit in some degree for sa&#770;ga&#770;n.)<p>as that &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; is the same as the Ksatrapa&#770;v of the inscriptions, i.e., protector of the kingdom.<p>(Note: See H. Rawlinson, Asiatic Journal, xi. 1, p. 116 ss.; and Spiegel, Keilinschriften, p. 194.)<p>Without at all overlooking the fact that this word sega&#770;n&#305;&#772;m, so far as it can really be supposed to be a Persian word, favours the later composition of this portion of the book of Isaiah, we cannot admit that it has any decisive weight, inasmuch as the Persian word parde&#772;s occurs even in the Song of Solomon. And the indications which might be found in the word sega&#770;n&#305;&#772;m unfavourable to Isaiah's authorship are abundantly counterbalanced by what immediately follows. </body></html>
