The most probable meaning may be, 'I have done it as a righteous and just God, or in the accomplishment of my righteous purposes. I am the just moral governor of the universe, and to accomplish my purposes of justice and fidelity, I have designated thee to this work.' Lowth has well rendered it, 'For a righteous purpose.' In this work all was righteousness. God was righteous, who appointed him; it was because he was righteous, and could not save without a mediator and an atonement, that he sent him into the world; he selected one who was eminently righteous to accomplish his purpose; and he came that he might establish righteousness on the earth, and confirm the just government of God (see <a href="/isaiah/42-21.htm">Isaiah 42:21</a>).<p>And will hold thine hand - I will take thee by the hand, as one does who guides and leads another. The phrase denotes the same as to guard, or keep - as we protect a child by taking him by the hand.<p>And give thee for a covenant - This is evidently an abbreviated form of expression, and the meaning is, 'I will give or appoint thee as the medium, or means by which a covenant shall be made with the people; or a mediator of the new covenant which God is about to establish with men' (see <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). A similar expression occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, where it is said of the Messiah, 'and this man shall be the peace;' that is, he shall be the source of peace, or peace shall be established and maintained by him. So in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>, it is said of him, 'he is our peace.'<p>Of the people - It has been doubted whether this means the Jewish people, or the Gentiles. Grotius, Hengstenberg, Vitringa, and others understand it of the Jews; Rosenmuller and others, of the Gentiles. It is not easy to determine which is the correct interpretation. But the meaning, as I apprehend, is, not that he would confirm the ancient covenant with the descendants of Abraham, as Hengstenberg and Vitringa suppose, but that his covenant would be established with all, with both Jews and Gentiles. According to this, it will refer to the Jews, not as Jews, or as already interested in the covenant, but as constituting one portion of the world; and the whole expression will mean, that his religion will be extended to Jews and Gentiles: that is, to the whole world.<p>For a light of the Gentiles - (See <a href="/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>). 'Light' is the emblem of knowledge, instruction, and of the true religion. The Messiah is often called 'light,' and the 'light of the world' (see <a href="/matthew/4-16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; compare the note at <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>, <a href="/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>). This is one of the numerous declarations which occur in Isaiah, that the religion of the Messiah would be extended to the pagan world; and that they, as well as the Jews, would be brought to partake of its privileges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. in righteousness&#8212;rather, "for a righteous purpose" [Lowth].

See Appendix, Note II, and cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and will keep thee</span>] R.V. marg. (“form thee”) derives the verb from a different root; if this sense be taken, it is necessary to read the words in close connexion with what follows: “I will form and appoint thee for a covenant &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a covenant of the people</span>] The expression occurs again in ch. <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>, and is one of the most difficult in this prophecy. The idea is necessarily a pregnant one, and it is nowhere developed in such a way that we can be sure of the exact meaning. The notion of a “national league” must be dismissed, because the Heb. <span class="ital">běrîth</span>, unlike the German “Bund,” nowhere means “confederation.” To take “people” in the sense of “humanity” is also unsuitable because of <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>, which clearly limits the reference to Israel. Looking at the phrase by itself two constructions are grammatically possible: (<span class="ital">a</span>) We may render it, “a covenant of a people,” or “a covenant people,” after the analogy of <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm" title="And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.">Genesis 16:12</a>, where Ishmael is called “a wild ass of a man” (cf. “Wonder of a Counsellor” in ch. <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>). This, however, is somewhat strained. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The most natural, and on the whole probably the most satisfactory rendering is, “a nation’s covenant,” i.e. the covenant upon which a nation is constituted, the conception implied being that Israel’s future national existence must be based on a new covenant between it and Jehovah (ch. <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm" title="Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.">Isaiah 55:3</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/31-30.htm" title="But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge....">Jeremiah 31:30-32</a>). The difficulty is thus reduced to the pregnancy of the statement that the Servant <span class="ital">is</span> or <span class="ital">shall be</span> this covenant. It is probably to be explained in accordance with such expressions as “thou shalt be a blessing” (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm" title="And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing:">Genesis 12:2</a>). As “blessing” there means “cause of blessing,” so here “covenant” may be equivalent to the <span class="ital">ground</span> or (as most commentators explain) the <span class="ital">mediator</span> of a national covenant. The idea at all events must be something like this: the Divine ideal represented by the Servant of the Lord becomes the basis of a new national life, inasmuch as it expresses that for the sake of which Jehovah enters into a new covenant relation with His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a light of the</span> <span class="bld">nations</span>] The ultimate destiny of the Servant; see on <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness</span>.

So Christ is called "<span class="accented">our</span> Salvation" and "our <span class="accented">Peace</span>," and again, "our Redemption" and "our Life."
