Multitudes are ruined for want of observing that which they cannot but see; they perish, not through ignorance, but carelessness. The Lord is well-pleased in the making known his own righteousness. For their sins they were spoiled of all their possessions. This fully came to pass in the destruction of the Jewish nation. There is no resisting, nor escaping God's anger. See the mischief sin makes; it provokes God to anger. And those not humbled by lesser judgments, must expect greater. Alas! how many professed Christians are blind as the benighted heathen! While the Lord is well-pleased in saving sinners through the righteousness of Christ he will also glorify his justice, by punishing all proud despisers. Seeing God has poured out his wrath on his once-favoured people, because of their sins, let us fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should be found to come short of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is blind, but my servant? - Some of the Jewish expositors suppose that by 'servant' here, the prophet himself is intended, who, they suppose is here called blind and deaf by the impious Jews who rejected his message. But it is evident, that by 'servant' here, the Jewish people themselves are intended, the singular being used for the plural, in a sense similar to that where they are so often called 'Jacob' and 'Israel.' The phrase 'servants of God' is often given to his people, and is used to denote true worshippers. The word is used here to denote those who professed to be the true worshippers of Yahweh. The prophet had, in the previous verses, spoken of the blindness and stupidity of the Gentile world. He here turns to his own countrymen, and addresses them as more blind, and deaf, and stupid than they. 'Who,' he asks, 'is as blind as they are?' Where are any of the pagan nations so insensible to the appeals of God, and so hard-hearted? The idea of the prophet is, that the Jews had had far greater advantages, and yet they were so sunk in sin that it might be said that comparatively none were blind but they. Even the degradation of the pagan nations, under the circumstances of the case, could not be compared with theirs.<p>As my messenger that I sent - Lowth renders this, 'And deaf, as he to whom I have sent my messengers.' The Septuagint renders it, 'And deaf but those that rule over them;' by a slight change in the Hebrew text. The Vulgate reads it as Lowth has rendered it. The Chaldee renders it,' If the wicked are converted, shall they not be called my servants? And the sinners to whom I sent my prophets?' But the sense seems to be this: The Jewish people were regarded as a people selected and preserved by God for the purpose of preserving and extending the true religion. They might be spoken of as sent for the great purpose of enlightening the world, as God's messengers in the midst of the deep darkness of benighted nations, and as appointed to be the agents by which the true religion was to be perpetuated and propagated on earth. Or perhaps, the word 'messenger' here may denote collectively the Jewish leaders, teachers, and priests, who had been sent as the messengers of God to that people, and who were, with the people, sunk in deep debasement and sin.<p>As he that is perfect - (&#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;  k&#305;&#770;meshulla&#770;m). A great variety of interpretations has been offered on this word - arising from the difficulty of giving the appellation 'perfect' to a people so corrupt as were the Jews in the time of Isaiah. Jerome renders it, Qui venundatus est - 'He that is sold.' The Syriac renders it, 'Who is blind as the prince?' Symmachus renders it, &#x3a9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; ho&#772;s ho teleios; and Kimchi in a similar manner by &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  ta&#770;m&#305;&#770;ym - 'perfect.' The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;  sha&#772;lam means properly "to be whole, sound, safe"; to be completed, finished, ended: and then, to be at peace or friendship with anyone. And it may he applied to the Jews, to whom it undoubtedly refers here, in one of the following senses; either<p>(1) ironically, as claiming to be perfect; or<p>(2) as those who professed to be perfect; or<p>(3) as being favored with rites and laws, and a civil and sacred constitution that were complete (Vitringa); or<p>(4) as being in friendship with God, as Grotius and Gesenius suppose.<p>It most probably refers to the fact that they were richly endowed by Yahweh with complete and happy institutions adapted to their entire welfare, and such as, in comparison with other nations, were suited to make them perfect.<p>As the Lord's servant - The Jewish people, professing to serve and obey God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. my servant&#8212;namely, Israel. Who of the heathen is so blind? Considering Israel's high privileges, the heathen's blindness was as nothing compared with that of Israelite idolaters.<p>my messenger &#8230; sent&#8212;Israel was designed by God to be the herald of His truth to other nations.<p>perfect&#8212;furnished with institutions, civil and religious, suited to their perfect well-being. Compare the title, "Jeshurun," the perfect one, applied to Israel (compare Isa 44:2), as the type of Messiah [Vitringa]. Or translate, the friend of God, which Israel was by virtue of descent from Abraham, who was so called (Isa 41:8), [Gesenius]. The language, "my servant" (compare Isa 42:1), "messenger" (Mal 3:1), "perfect" (Ro 10:4; Heb 2:10; 1Pe 2:22), can, in the full antitypical sense, only apply to Christ. So Isa 42:21 plainly refers to Him. "Blind" and "deaf" in His case refer to His endurance of suffering and reproach, as though He neither saw nor heard (Ps 38:13, 14). Thus there is a transition by contrast from the moral blindness of Israel (Isa 42:18) to the patient blindness and deafness of Messiah [Horsley].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who is blind, but my servant?</span> but no people under heaven are so blind as the Jews, who call themselves my servants and people, who will not receive their Messiah, though he be recommended to them with such evident and illustrious signs and miraculous works, as force belief from the most unbelieving and obstinate Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My messenger; </span> my messengers, the singular number being put for the plural, as it is commonly in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That I sent; </span> the priests and other teachers whom I appointed to instruct my people in the right way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As he that is perfect; </span> as the most eminent teachers and rulers of the Jews, whom he calleth <span class="ital">perfect</span>, either because it was their duty to know and teach the way and truth of God perfectly; or rather sarcastically, because they pretended to greater perfection, and proudly called themselves <span class="ital">rabbies</span> and <span class="ital">masters</span>, as our Saviour observed, and despised the people as cursed, and not knowing the law, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/7-49.htm" title="But this people who knows not the law are cursed.">John 7:49</a></span>, and derided Christ for calling them <span class="ital">blind</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/9-40.htm" title="And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?">John 9:40</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the Lord’s servant; </span> which rifle, as it was given to the Jewish people in the first clause of the verse, so here it scents to be given to the priests, because they were called and obliged to be the Lord’s servants in a special and eminent manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/42.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is blind, but my servant?....

They are manifestly the work of Jehovah Himself, and consist primarily in the subjugation of His enemies, who are holding His people in captivity. "Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise from the end of the earth, ye navigators of the sea, and its fulness; ye islands, and their inhabitants. Let the desert and the cities thereof strike up, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; the inhabitants of the rock-city may rejoice, shout from the summits of the mountains. Let them give glory to Jehovah, and proclaim His praise in the islands. Jehovah, like a hero will He go forth, kindle jealousy like a man of war; He will breath forth into a war-cry, a yelling war-cry, prove Himself a hero upon His enemies." The "new things" furnish the impulse and materials of "a new song," such as had never been heard in the heathen world before. This whole group of vv. is like a variation of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-14.htm">Isaiah 24:14-15</a>. The standing-place, whence the summons is uttered, is apparently Ezion-geber, at the head of the Elanitic Gulf, that seaport town from which in the time of the kings the news of the nations reached the Holy Land through the extensive commerce of Israel. From this point the eye stretches to the utmost circle of the earth, and then returns from the point where it meets with those who "go down to the sea," i.e., who navigate the ocean which lies lower than the solid ground. These are to sing, and everything that lives and moves in the sea is to join in the sailors' song. The islands and coast lands, that are washed by the sea, are likewise to sing together with their inhabitants. After the summons has drawn these into the net of the song of praise, it moves into the heart of the land. The desert and its cities are to lift up (viz., "their voice"), the villages which Kedar inhabits. The reference to Sela', the rock-city of Edomitish Nabataea, which is also mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a> (the Wadi Musa, which is still celebrated for its splendid ruins), shows by way of example what cities are intended. Their inhabitants are to ascend the steep mountains by which the city is surrounded, and to raise a joyful cry (yitsva&#770;chu&#772;, to cry out with a loud noise; cf., <a href="/isaiah/24-11.htm">Isaiah 24:11</a>). Along with the inhabitants of cities, the stationary Arabs, who are still called Hadariye in distinction from Wabariye, the Arabs of the tents, are also summoned; hadar (cha&#770;tse&#772;r) is a fixed abode, in contrast to bedu&#770;, the steppe, where the tents are pitched for a short time, now in one place and now in another. In <a href="/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a> the summons becomes more general. The subject is the heathen universally and in every place; they are to give Jehovah the glory (<a href="/psalms/56-2.htm">Psalm 56:2</a>), and declare His praise upon the islands, i.e., to the remotest ends of the whole world of nations. In <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a> there follows the reason for this summons, and the theme of the new song in honour of the God of Israel, viz., His victory over His enemies, the enemies of His people. The description is anthropomorphically dazzling and bold, such as the self-assurance and vividness of the Israelitish idea of God permitted, without any danger of misunderstanding. Jehovah goes out into the conflict like a hero; and like a "man of war," i.e., like one who has already fought many battles, and is therefore ready for war, and well versed in warfare, He stirs up jealousy (see at <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). His jealousy has slumbered as it were for a long time, as if smouldering under the ashes; but now He stirs it up, i.e., makes it burn up into a bright flame. Going forward to the attack, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, "He breaks out into a cry," &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, "yea, a yelling cry" (kal <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>, to cry with a yell; hiphil, to utter a yelling cry). In the words, "He will show Himself as a hero upon His enemies," we see Him already engaged in the battle itself, in which He proves Himself to possess the strength and boldness of a hero (hithgabbar only occurs again in the book of Job). The overthrow which heathenism here suffers at the hand of Jehovah is, according to our prophet's view, the final and decisive one. The redemption of Israel, which is thus about to appear, is redemption from the punishment of captivity, and at the same time from all the troubles that arise from sin. The period following the captivity and the New Testament times here flow into one. </body></html>
