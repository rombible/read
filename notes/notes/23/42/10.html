The sentiment is, that God's goodness in providing a Saviour demands the thanksgiving of all the world.<p>A new song - A song hitherto unsung; one that shall be expressive of the goodness of God in this new manifestation of his mercy. None of the hymns of praise that had been employed to express his former acts of goodness would appropriately express this. The mercy was so great that it demanded a song expressly made for the occasion.<p>And his praise frown the end of the earth - From all parts of the earth.

The sense is, that they would be interested in the plan of mercy through a Redeemer; and hence, they are called on to celebrate the goodness of God (compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>). This is referred to by the prophet, first, because of the great multitude who thus go down to the sea; and, secondly, because their conversion will have so important an influence in diffusing the true religion to distant nations.<p>And all that is therein - Margin, as Hebrew, 'The fullness thereof.' All that fill it; that is, either in ships, or by dwelling on the islands and coasts. The meaning is, that all who were upon the sea - the completeness, the wholeness of the maritime population, being equally interested with all others in the great salvation, should join in celebrating the goodness of God.<p>The isles - A large portion of the inhabitants of the world are dwellers upon islands. In modern times, some of the most signal displays of the divine mercy, and some of the most remarkable conversions to Christianity, have been there. In the Sandwich Islands, and in Ceylon, God has poured out his Spirit, and their inhabitants have been among the first in the pagan world to embrace the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. new song&#8212;such as has never before been sung, called for by a new manifestation of God's grace, to express which no hymn for former mercies would be appropriate.

These Psalmists probably borrowed the term from our prophet, whose use of it bears the stamp of originality. It is a song “such as has never been heard in the heathen world” (Delitzsch). see ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/24-14.htm" title="They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea....">Isaiah 24:14-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the end of the earth</span>] means (as in <a href="/genesis/19-4.htm" title="But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm" title="One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,">Jeremiah 51:31</a>) “from end to end.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye that go down to the sea</span>] <span class="bld">seafarers</span>, cf. <a href="/psalms/107-23.htm" title="They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;">Psalm 107:23</a>.

The call for a "new song" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a "new" one (see ver. 9). The expression is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His praise from the end of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his praise be sung by all the inhabitants of the earth to its remotest bounds." <span class="cmt_word">The sea</span>. Sea and land are called upon equally to proclaim God's praise; the sea, "and its fulness" (margin) - those who frequent it in ships, and those who dwell on its shores and islands. The last clause, "the isles and the inhabitants thereof," is exegetical of the preceding one - " all that is therein." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The figures in <a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a> now lead to the thought that the servant of God will never be extinguished or become broken Himself. "He will not become faint or broken, till He establish right upon earth, and the islands wait for His instruction." As &#1497;&#1499;&#1492;&#1492; (become faint) points back to &#1499;&#1492;&#1492; &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; (the finat or glimmering wick), so &#1497;&#1512;&#1468;&#1493;&#1509; must point back to &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (the bruised or broken reed); it cannot therefore be derived from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (to run) in the sense of "He will not be rash or impetuous, but execute His calling with wise moderation," as Hengstenberg supposes, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>, from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;  equals  &#1497;&#1512;&#1509; (Ges. 67, Anm. 9), in the neuter sense of infringetur (will break). His zeal will not be extinguished, nor will anything break His strength, till He shall have secured for right a firm standing on the earth (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; is a fut. ex. so far as the meaning is concerned, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>). The question arises now, whether what follows is also governed by &#1506;&#1491;, in the sense of "and until the islands shall have believed his instruction," as Hitzig supposes; or whether it is an independent sentence, as rendered by the lxx and in <a href="/matthew/12-21.htm">Matthew 12:21</a>. We prefer the latter, both because of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>, and also because, although &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1492; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; may certainly mean to exercise a believing confidence in the word of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>), &#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; can only mean "to wait with longing for a person's instruction" (<a href="/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>), and especially in this case, where no thought is more naturally suggested, than that the messenger to the Gentile world will be welcomed by a consciousness of need already existing in the heathen world itself. There is a gratia praeparans at work in the Gentile world, as these prophecies all presuppose, in perfect harmony with the Gospel of John, with which they have so much affinity; and it is an actual fact, that the cry for redemption runs through the whole human race, i.e., an earnest longing, the ultimate object of which, however unconsciously, is the servant of Jehovah and his instruction from Zion (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>) - in other words, the gospel. </body></html>
