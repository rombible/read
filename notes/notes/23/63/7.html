Possibly, in the arrangement of the book it was thought that such a psalm followed rightly on the great dramatic dialogue which represented the victory of the Redeemer. The psalm begins, according to the implied rule of <a href="/psalms/50-23.htm" title="Whoever offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.">Psalm 50:23</a>, with praise, and passes afterward to narrative and supplication.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/63.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm" title="I will mention the loving kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.">Isaiah 63:7</a></span>. “The remaining part of this chapter” says Bishop Lowth, “with the whole chapter following, contains a penitential confession and supplication of the Israelites in their present state of dispersion, in which they have so long marvellously subsisted, and still continue to subsist, as a people; cast out of their country, without any proper form of civil polity or religious worship; their temple destroyed, their city desolated, and lost to them; and their whole nation scattered over the face of the earth; apparently deserted and cast off by the God of their fathers, as no longer his peculiar people.” Vitringa has nearly the same views of this section of the prophet’s discourse. He supposes that it pertains to the present Jews and their posterity, during this their dispersion, and that when they shall see that wonderful display of God’s power, which will hereafter be made in the destruction of the Papal church and tyranny, they will be converted to the Christian religion. In a view to this, he considers the prophet as here introducing a company of them, who represent the first-fruits at the beginning of this great work of grace, deploring the blindness and hardness of their nation, and with the utmost humility turning themselves to God, and praying for that complete conversion of their people which is to follow the coming in of <span class="ital">the fulness of the Gentiles. </span>See <a href="/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in....">Romans 11:25-26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will mention the loving-kindness of the Lord — </span>Those penitent Jews, in whose name the prophet is supposed to speak, being convinced themselves of the truth of Christianity, begin here to intercede for the rest of their brethren, still remaining in that state of blindness and darkness under which the nation had long groaned. “They begin with acknowledging God’s great mercies and favours to their nation, and the ungrateful returns made for them on their part; that by their disobedience they had forfeited his protection, and caused him to become their adversary. But now, induced by the memory of the great things he had done for them, they address their humble supplication to him for the renewal of his mercies. They beseech him to regard them in consideration of his former loving-kindness; they acknowledge him for their Father and Creator; they confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they had so long suffered. The whole passage is in the elegiac form, pathetic and elegant, and probably designed as a formulary of humiliation for the Israelites, in order to their conversion.” A few remarks on some of the expressions used therein may tend to place them in a clearer point of view.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next, seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will mention - This is evidently the language of the people celebrating the praises of God in view of all his mercies in former days. See the analysis to the chapter. The design of what follows, to the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-12</a>, is to implore the mercy of God in view of their depressed and ruined condition. They are represented as suffering under the infliction of long and continued ills; as cast out and driven to a distant land; as deprived of their former privileges, and as having been long subjected to great evils. Their temple is destroyed; their city desolate; and their whole nation afflicted and oppressed. The time is probably near the close of the captivity; though Lowth supposes that it refers to the Jews as scattered over all lands, and driven away from the country of their fathers. They begin their petitions in this verse with acknowledging God's great mercies to their fathers and to their nation; then they confess their own disobedience, and supplicate, by various arguments, the divine mercy and favor. The Chaldee commences the verse thus, 'The prophet said, I will remember the mercy of the Lord.' But it is the language of the people, not that of the prophet. The word rendered 'mention' (&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;  'azekiyr), means properly, I will cause to remember, or to be remembered (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>).<p>And the praises of the Lord - That is, I will recount the deeds which show that he is worthy of thanksgiving. The repetitions in this verse are designed to be emphatic; and the meaning of the whole is, that Yahweh had given them abundant cause of praise, notwithstanding the evils which they endured. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/63.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

These are the words of the prophet, as Jarchi and Kimchi observe; who, having heard what the Lord would do for his church and people in later times, by avenging them on their enemies, calls to mind the favours bestowed on Israel of old; and determines to make mention of them, and put the saints in mind of them, as types, earnests, and pledges of what would be done for them; and to encourage their faith and hope in the performance of what was promised them: these he calls "the lovingkindnesses of the Lord"; meaning not only the instances of his providential goodness in bringing them out of Egypt, leading them through the Red sea and wilderness, and settling them in Canaan's land, after particularly mentioned; but also those of his special grace and goodness to the chosen of God among them; called in the plural number "lovingkindnesses", being the acts of all the three Persons displayed in election, redemption, and sanctification; and because these are many and various, and an abundance of grace and love is manifested in them: <p>and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us; which are due to him from all creatures, angels and men, and especially the saints; and which belong to each divine Person, according to the various gifts of grace freely bestowed by them; such as the gift of God himself to his people; the gifts of his Son, and of the blessed Spirit, with all his graces, faith, hope, love, repentance, &amp;c.; and all the blessings of grace; as pardon, justification, adoption, and eternal life; a right unto it, and meetness for it all which call for praise and thankfulness: and the <p>great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses; the gifts of grace are bestowed, not according to the merits of men, for then they would not be free grace gifts; and, besides, there is no merit in a creature; the best works of the best of men are not meritorious, of anything at the hand of God; but all they have flow from mere sovereign mercy, pure grace, and free unmerited love, which is abundant, yea, boundless, and even infinite. A heap of words is here made use of, and all little enough to express the wonderful kindness of God in the acts of his grace and goodness to his church and people; which ought always to be had in sight and mind, and to be remembered and spoken of in private and in public. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/63.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, <i>and</i> the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><p>(g) The prophet speaks this to move the people to remember God's benefits in times past, that they may be confirmed in their troubles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/63.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">I will mention</span>] lit. “commemorate,” but with the implied idea of praise, as <a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm" title="And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:">1 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-17.htm" title="I will make your name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise you for ever and ever.">Psalm 45:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/71-16.htm" title="I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of your righteousness, even of your only.">Psalm 71:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-13.htm" title="O LORD our God, other lords beside you have had dominion over us: but by you only will we make mention of your name.">Isaiah 26:13</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the praises of the Lord</span>] the <span class="bld">praiseworthy deeds</span>, as ch. <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the great goodness</span>] Cf. <a href="/psalms/145-7.htm" title="They shall abundantly utter the memory of your great goodness, and shall sing of your righteousness.">Psalm 145:7</a>, where the expression occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to his mercies &c.</span>] Cf. <a href="/psalms/51-1.htm" title="Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving kindness: according to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.">Psalm 51:1</a>,—one of several points of resemblance,—also <a href="/psalms/106-45.htm" title="And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.">Psalm 106:45</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7–9</span>.

In a more reflective strain the writer appears to seek for a reconciliation of Jehovah’s attitude to Israel with His eternally righteous character.

Can Jehovah look on these things and yet restrain His compassion (<span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/63-12.htm" title="That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?">Isaiah 63:12</a></span>)?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage is one of the most instructive of O.T. prayers, and deserves careful study as an expression of the chastened and tremulous type of piety begotten in the sorrows of the Exile. Along with much that is of the permanent essence of prayer,—thanksgiving, confession of sin, and supplication,—it contains utterances which may cause surprise to a Christian reader, although they are paralleled in some of the Psalms, and in other portions of the literature. Very singular is the plea that the sinfulness of the people is due to the excessive and protracted anger of Jehovah, who “causes them to err from His ways” (<a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm" title="You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you are wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.">Isaiah 64:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-7.htm" title="And there is none that calls on your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you: for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.">Isaiah 64:7</a>). This feeling appears to proceed from two sources; on the one hand the ancient idea that national calamity is the proof of Jehovah’s anger, and on the other the lesson taught by all the prophets, that the sole cause of Jehovah’s anger is the people’s sins. The writer seems unable perfectly to harmonize these principles. He accepts the verdict of Providence on the sins of the nation, but he feels also a disproportion between the offence and the punishment, which neutralises all efforts after righteousness, unless Jehovah will relent from the fierceness of His wrath. The higher truth that the Divine chastisement aims at the purification of the people, and is therefore a mark of love, is not yet grasped, and for this reason the O.T. believers fall short of the liberty of the sons of God. Yet amid all these perplexities the faith of the Church holds fast to the truth of the Fatherhood of God, and appeals to the love which must be in His heart, although it be not manifest in His providential dealings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So far as the <span class="ital">ideas</span> of the passage are concerned, it might have been composed at any time from the Exile downwards. Nor are the historical allusions so clear as could be desired. From <a href="/isaiah/63-18.htm" title="The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.">Isaiah 63:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/64-11.htm" title="Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.">Isaiah 64:11</a> f. we learn that the Temple has been burned, and the land laid waste. It is natural to understand this of the destruction of the city and Temple by the Chaldæans in 586, and to conclude that the prayer was written during the Exile or at least before the rebuilding of the Temple in 520. In <a href="/isaiah/63-18.htm" title="The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.">Isaiah 63:18</a> it is said that the Holy Land has been possessed “but a little while.” If the prayer was written in exile this must refer to the whole period from Joshua to the Captivity, which is not an interpretation that commends itself at first sight. It would no doubt be more intelligible if written not long after the restoration under Zerubbabel (cf. <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm" title="And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.">Ezra 9:8</a>). But then we are confronted with the difficulty of the destruction of the Temple, for Duhm’s explanation that the writer ignores the second Temple because of its inferiority to the first can hardly be regarded as satisfactory; and to assume (with Kuenen and others) a destruction of the Temple by the Samaritans (see Ryle’s note on <a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm" title="And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.">Nehemiah 1:3</a>) is hazardous in face of the silence of history. Partly for these reasons, and partly because of affinities to ch. 24–27, and some Psalms which he assigns to the same period, Cheyne brings down the date of composition to the time of Artaxerxes Ochus (cf. Vol. i. of this commentary, p. 204). Apart from <a href="/isaiah/63-18.htm" title="The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.">Isaiah 63:18</a>, the hypothesis of exilic authorship presents no serious difficulty, for although the surrounding discourses are probably post-exilic, it is quite conceivable that an earlier writing might have been incorporated with them as sufficiently expressive of the mind of the nation at the later period.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-14.</span> - GOD PRAISED FOR HIS MERCIES. The address opens with pure and simple thanksgiving of the most general kind, God being praised for his loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathy with his people (vers. 7-9). An historical survey is then commenced, and Israel's shortcomings contrasted with God's mercies, but with a predominantly thankful and even jubilant tone (vers. 10-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will mention</span>; or, <span class="accented">celebrate</span>.

In its dramatic style it resembles <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1-10</a>; in its visionary and emblematical character it resembles the tetralogy in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1-22:14</a>. The attention of the seer is attracted by a strange and lofty form coming from Edom, or more strictly from Bozrah; not the place in Auranitis or Hauran (<a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>) which is memorable in church history, but the place in Edomitis or Gebal, between Petra and the Dead Sea, which still exists as a village in ruins under the diminutive name of el-Busaire. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, in deep red clothes from Bozrah? This, glorious in his apparel, bending to and fro in the fulness of his strength?" The verb cha&#770;mats means to be sharp or bitter; but here, where it can only refer to colour, it means to be glaring, and as the Syriac shows, in which it is generally applied to blushing from shame or reverential awe, to be a staring red (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;). The question, what is it that makes the clothes of this new-comer so strikingly red? is answered afterwards. But apart from the colour, they are splendid in their general arrangement and character. The person seen approaching is &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1492;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cf., Arab. h&#803;dr and hdr, to rush up, to shoot up luxuriantly, ahdar used for a swollen body), and possibly through the medium of ha&#770;da&#770;r (which may signify primarily a swelling, or pad, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and secondarily pomp or splendour), "to honour or adorn;" so that ha&#770;du&#772;r signifies adorned, grand (as in <a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>; Targ. II lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), splendid. The verb tsa&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h, to bend or stoop, we have already met with in <a href="/isaiah/51-14.htm">Isaiah 51:14</a>. Here it is used to denote a gesture of proud self-consciousness, partly with or without the idea of the proud bending back of the head (or bending forward to listen), and partly with that of swaying to and fro, i.e., the walk of a proud man swinging to and fro upon the hips. The latter is the sense in which we understand tso&#772;&#8219;eh here, viz., as a syn. of the Arabic mutama&#770;li, to bend proudly from one side to the other (Vitringa: se huc illuc motitans). The person seen here produces the impression of great and abundant strength; and his walk indicates the corresponding pride of self-consciousness.<p>"Who is this?" asks the seer of a third person. But the answer comes from the person himself, though only seen in the distance, and therefore with a voice that could be heard afar off. "I am he that speaketh in righteousness, mighty to aid." Hitzig, Knobel, and others, take righteousness as the object of the speaking; and this is grammatically possible (&#1489;&#1468;  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;, e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>). But our prophet uses &#1489;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511; in <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-13.htm">Isaiah 45:13</a>, and &#1489;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; in an adverbial sense: "strictly according to the rule of truth (more especially that of the counsel of mercy or plan of salvation) and right." The person approaching says that he is great in word and deed (<a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). He speaks in righteousness; in the zeal of his holiness threatening judgment to the oppressors, and promising salvation to the oppressed; and what he threatens and promises, he carries out with mighty power. He is great (&#1512;&#1489;, not &#1512;&#1489;; S. &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Jer. propugnator) to aid the oppressed against their oppressors. This alone might lead us to surmise, that it is God from whose mouth of righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>) the consolation of redemption proceeds, and whose holy omnipotent arm (<a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>) carries out the act of redemption. </body></html>
