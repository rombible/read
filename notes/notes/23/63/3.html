Travelling, not as wearied by the combat, but, in the greatness of his strength, prepared to overcome every opposing power. Messiah declares that he had been treading the wine-press of the wrath of God, Re 14:19; 19:13, and by his own power, without any human help, he had crushed his obstinate opposers, for the day of vengeance was determined on, being the appointed season for rescuing his church. Once, he appeared on earth in apparent weakness, to pour out his precious blood as an atonement for our sins; but he will in due time appear in the greatness of his strength. The vintage ripens apace; the day of vengeance, fixed and determined on, approaches apace; let sinners seek to be reconciled to their righteous Judge, ere he brings down their strength to the earth.

The word used here (&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;  ne&#772;tsach) does not commonly mean blood; but splendor, glory, purity, truth, perpetuity, eternity. Gesenius derives the word, as used here, from an Arabic word meaning to sprinkle, to scatter; and hence, the juice or liquor of the grape as it is sprinkled or spirted from grapes when trodden. There is no doubt here that it refers to blood - though with the idea of its being spirted out by treading down a foe.<p>And I will stain all my raiment - I have stained all my raiment - referring to the fact that the slaughter was extensive and entire.

And though this be true of his passion, in which sense some would carry it, yet doth it not so well suit with the design; for Christ is described here not as a priest sacrificing, or shedding of his own blood, but as a king, conquering and shedding the blood of his and his church’s enemies; hence it is said <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">their blood, </span> not his own, to show that it cannot fairly relate to his passion: besides Christ could expect no help in that, for he knew none could; but here he looked, and wondered that there was none, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm" title="And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me.">Isaiah 63:5</a></span>.

This is an answer to the question before put, and confirms what was observed, that his garments were like one that treadeth in the winepress; this was very true, he had trodden it, and trodden it alone, and that was the reason his garments were of such a hue; what others did by their servants, he did by himself, alone and without them. The winepress is a symbol of the wrath of God; not of what Christ bore himself as the sinner's surety, for then he was trodden as a vine, or the clusters of it, himself; but of what he executed on others. Wicked men are compared to clusters of the vine; the winepress into which they are cast is the wrath of God, and Christ is the treader of it; particularly he will be in the latter day, when antichrist and his followers will be destroyed by him; see <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>. <p>And of the people there was none with me; either fighting with him, that could oppose him, any more than the clusters of grapes can resist the treaders of them; or to assist him in taking vengeance on his enemies: for though the armies of heaven follow him in white, these are little more than attendants and spectators, at most but instruments; all the power to conquer and destroy is from himself, and owing to the twoedged sword proceeding out of his mouth, <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a> even as when he stood in the legal place and stead of his people there were none of them with him; he alone was the author of salvation, none could bear the wrath of God but himself, or engage with spiritual enemies, or work out salvation for them. But of this the texts speaks not, only of the destruction of the enemies of Christ and his church: <p>for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; with great eagerness, with all his might and strength; and this is the reason why his garments were so stained, even with the blood of his enemies, trodden and trampled under foot by him in this furious manner; as a person in a winepress alone, and treading it with all his might, has his garments more sparkled and stained with the juice of the grape, than when there are many, and these tread lightly. The words being in the future tense show that they respect time to come; and the manner of speaking ascertains the accomplishment of them, and which is further confirmed by what follows: <p>and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment; just as the garments of those that tread in the winepress are sprinkled and stained with the juice of the grape; this will have its accomplishment when he shall appear in a vesture dipped in blood, or shall be as bloody, with the blood of his enemies, as if it was dipped in it, <a href="/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/63.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have trodden the wine-press.</span> The warrior replies. He accepts the suggestion of the prophet; but metaphorically, not literally. He has indeed been "treading a wine-press," but it is the wine-press of his fury, in which he has trampled down his enemies; and the stains upon his raiment are, consequently, not wine-stains, but stains of blood (comp. <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Alone</span>.

"Jehovah hath sworn by His right hand, and by His powerful arm, Surely I no more give thy corn for food to thine enemies; and foreigners will to drink thy must, for which thou hast laboured hard. No, they that gather it in shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that store it, shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary." The church will no more succumb to the tyranny of a worldly power. Peace undisturbed, and unrestricted freedom, reign there. With praise to Jehovah are the fruits of the land enjoyed by those who raised and reaped them. &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; (with an auxiliary pathach, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>) is applied to the cultivation of the soil, and includes the service of the heathen who are incorporated in Israel (<a href="/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5</a>); whilst &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; (whence &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493; with &#1505; raphatum) or &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; (poel, whence the reading &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;, cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>, meloshn&#305;&#772;; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, ve-dorshu&#772;, for which in some codd. and editions we find &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;, an intermediate form between piel and poel; see at <a href="/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>) and &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; stand in the same relation to one another as condere (horreo) and colligere (cf., <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The expression bechatsro&#772;th qodsh&#305;&#772;, in the courts of my sanctuary, cannot imply that the produce of the harvest will never be consumed anywhere else than there (which is inconceivable), but only that their enjoyment of the harvest-produce will be consecrated by festal meals of worship, with an allusion to the legal regulation that two-tenths (ma&#8219;a&#774;se&#772;r she&#772;n&#305;&#772;) should be eaten in a holy place (liphne&#772; Jehovah) by the original possessor and his family, with the addition of the Levites and the poor (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-27</a> : see Saalschtz, Mosaisches Recht, cap. 42). Such thoughts, as that all Israel will then be a priestly nation, or that all Jerusalem will be holy, are not implied in this promise. All that it affirms is, that the enjoyment of the harvest-blessing will continue henceforth undisturbed, and be accompanied with the grateful worship of the giver, and therefore, because sanctified by thanksgiving, will become an act of worship in itself. This is what Jehovah has sworn "by His right hand," which He only lifts up with truth, and "by His powerful arm," which carries out what it promises without the possibility of resistance.
