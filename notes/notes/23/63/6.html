The section which thus closes has often been applied (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the Prayer-Book Epistle for the Monday before Easter) to the passion of our Lord. In that agony and death it has been said He was alone, and none was with Him. He trod the winepress of the wrath of God. It is obvious, however, that this, though we may legitimately apply some of Isaiah’s phrases to it, is not an interpretation of this passage, which paints a victory, and not a passion. The true analogue in the New Testament is that of the victory of the triumphant Christ in <a href="/context/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11-13</a>; but it may be conceded that, from one point of view, the agony and the cross were themselves a conflict with the powers of evil (<a href="/context/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31-32</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>), and that as He came out of that conflict as a conqueror, the words in which Isaiah paints the victor over Edom may, though in a much remoter analogy, be applicable to Him in that conflict also.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>63:1-6 The prophet, in vision, beholds the Messiah returning in triumph from the conquest of his enemies, of whom Edom was a type. Travelling, not as wearied by the combat, but, in the greatness of his strength, prepared to overcome every opposing power. Messiah declares that he had been treading the wine-press of the wrath of God, Re 14:19; 19:13, and by his own power, without any human help, he had crushed his obstinate opposers, for the day of vengeance was determined on, being the appointed season for rescuing his church. Once, he appeared on earth in apparent weakness, to pour out his precious blood as an atonement for our sins; but he will in due time appear in the greatness of his strength. The vintage ripens apace; the day of vengeance, fixed and determined on, approaches apace; let sinners seek to be reconciled to their righteous Judge, ere he brings down their strength to the earth. Does Christ say, I come quickly? let our hearts reply, Even so, come; let the year of the redeemed come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will tread them down - Or rather, 'I did tread them down.' The allusion here is to a warrior who tramples on his foes and treads them in the dust (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>).<p>And made them drunk - That is, I made them reel and fall under my fury like a drunken man. In describing the destruction of Idumea in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>, Yahweh says that his sword was made drunk, or that it rushed intoxicated from heaven. See the notes on that verse. But here he says that the people, under the terrors of his wrath, lost their power of self-command, and fell to the earth like an intoxicated man. Kimchi says that the idea is, that Yahweh extended the cup of his wrath for them to drink until they became intoxicated and fell. An image of this kind is several times used in the Scriptures (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>). Lowth and Noyes render this, 'I crushed them.' The reason of this change is, that according to Kennicott, twenty-seven manuscripts (three of them ancient) instead of the present Hebrew reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501;  va'a&#774;shakere&#772;m, 'And I will make them drunk,' read &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501;  va'a&#774;shabere&#772;m, 'I will break or crush them.' Such a change, it is true, might easily have been made from the similarity of the Hebrew letters, &#1499;  (k) and &#1489;  (b). But the authority for the change does not seem to me to be sufficient, nor is it necessary. The image of making them stagger and fall like a drunken man, is more poetic than the other, and is in entire accordance with the usual manner of writing by the sacred penman. The Chaldee renders it, 'I cast to the lowest earth the slain of their strong ones.'<p>And I will bring down their strength - I subdued their strong places, and their mighty armies. Such is the sense giver, to the passage by our translators. But Lowth and Noyes render it, more correctly, 'I spilled their life-blood upon the ground.' The word which our translators have rendered 'strength' (&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;  ne&#772;tsach), is the same word which is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, and which is rendered there 'blood' (see the note at that verse). It is probably used in the same sense here, and means that Yahweh had brought their blood to the earth; that is, he had spilled it upon the ground. So the Septuagint renders it, 'I shed their blood (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  kate&#772;gagon to haima) upon the earth.' This finishes the vision of the mighty conqueror returning from Edom. The following verse introduces a new subject. The sentiment in the passage is, that Yahweh by his own power, and by the might of his own arm, would subdue all his foes and redeem his people. Edom in its hostility to his people, the apt emblem of all his foes, would be completely humbled; and in its subjugation there would be the emblem and the pledge that all his enemies would be destroyed, and that his own church would be safe.

"Go forth, go forth through the gates, clear the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the road, clear it of stones; lift up a banner above the nations! Behold, Jehovah hath caused tidings to sound to the end of the earth. Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him. And men will call them the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah; and men will call thee, Striven after, A city that will not be forsaken." We cannot adopt the rendering proposed by Gesenius, "Go ye into the gates," whether of Jerusalem or of the temple, since the reading would then be &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>) or &#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>). For although &#1489;&#1468; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; may under certain circumstances be applied to entrance into a city (<a href="/judges/9-26.htm">Judges 9:26</a>), yet it generally denotes either passing through a land (<a href="/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-10.htm">Isaiah 34:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, etc.), or through a nation (<a href="/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14</a>), or through a certain place (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>); so that the phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, which does not occur anywhere else (for in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>, which refers, however, to the exodus of the people out of the gates of the cities of the captivity, &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; do not belong together), must refer to passing through the gate; and the cry &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; means just the same as &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; ("Go ye forth from Babylon") in <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a>. <p>The call to go out of Babylon forms the conclusion of the prophecy here, just as it does in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20-21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11-12</a>. It is addressed to the exiles; but who are they to whom the command is given, "Throw up a way," - a summons repeatedly found in all the three books of these prophecies (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>)? They cannot be the heathen, for this is contradicted by the conclusion of the charge, "Lift ye up a banner above the nations;" nor can we adopt what seems to us a useless fancy on the part of Stier, viz., that <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a> is addressed to the watchmen on the walls of Zion. We have no hesitation, therefore, in concluding that they are the very same persons who are to march through the gates of Babylon. The vanguard (or pioneers) of those who are coming out are here summoned to open the way by which the people are to march, to throw up the road (viz., by casting up an embankment, hamsilla&#770;h, as in <a href="/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>; maslu&#772;l, <a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>), to clear it of stones (siqqe&#772;l, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; cf., <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>, shikke&#772;l me&#772;'a&#770;da&#770;m), and lift up a banner above the nations (one rising so high as to be visible far and wide), that the diaspora of all places may join those who are returning home with the friendly help of the nations (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>). For Jehovah hath caused tidings to be heard to the end of the earth, i.e., as we may see from what follows, the tidings of their liberation; in other words, looking at the historical fulfilment, the proclamation of Cyrus, which he caused to be issued throughout his empire at the instigation of Jehovah (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>). Hitzig regards &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; as expressing what had actually occurred at the time when the prophet uttered his predictions; and in reality the standpoint of the prophets was so far a variable one, that the fulfilment of what was predicted did draw nearer and nearer to it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;. But as hinne&#772;h throughout the book of Isaiah, even when followed by a perfect, invariably points to something future, all that can be said is, that the divine announcement of the time of redemption, as having now arrived, stands out before the soul of the prophet with all the certainty of a historical fact. The conclusion which Knobel draws from the expression "to the end of the earth," as to the Babylonian standpoint of the prophet, is a false one. In his opinion, "the end of the earth" in such passages as <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a> ('aphse&#772;-'a&#770;rets), and <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a> (kenaph ha&#770;'a&#770;rets), signifies the western extremity of the orbis orientalis, that is to say, the region of the Mediterranean, more especially Palestine; whereas it was rather a term applied to the remotest lands which bounded the geographical horizon (compare <a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>, with <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>, and other passages). The words that follow ("Say ye," etc.) might be taken as a command issued on the ground of the divine hishimia&#774;&#8219; ("the Lord hath proclaimed"); but hishimia&#774;&#8219; itself is a word that needs to be supplemented, so that what follows is the divine proclamation: Men everywhere, i.e., as far as the earth or the dispersion of Israel extends, are to say to the daughter of Zion - that is to say, to the church which has its home in Zion, but is now in foreign lands - that "its salvation cometh," i.e., that Jehovah, its Saviour, is coming to bestow a rich reward upon His church, which has passed through sever punishment, but has been so salutarily refined. Those to whom the words "Say ye," etc., are addressed, are not only the prophets of Israel, but all the mourners of Zion, who become mebhasser&#305;&#772;m, just because they respond to this appeal (compare the meaning of this "Say ye to the daughter of Zion" with <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> in <a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). The whole of the next clause, "Behold, His reward," etc., is a repetition of the prophet's own words in <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>. It is a question whether the words "and they shall call thee," etc., contain the gospel which is to be proclaimed according to the will of Jehovah to the end of the earth (see <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>), or whether they are a continuation of the prophecy which commences with "Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed." The latter is the more probable, as the address here passes again into an objective promise. The realization of the gospel, which Jehovah causes to be preached, leads men to call those who are now still in exile "the holy people," "the redeemed" (lit. ransomed, <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>; like pedu&#772;ye&#772; in <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>). "And thee" - thus does the prophecy close by returning to a direct address to Zion-Jerusalem - "thee will men call deru&#772;sha&#770;h," sought assiduously, i.e., one whose welfare men, and still more Jehovah, are zealously concerned to promote (compare the opposite in <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>) - "a city that will not be forsaken," i.e., in which men gladly settle, and which will never be without inhabitants again (the antithesis to &#8219;a&#774;zu&#772;bha&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/60-15.htm">Isaiah 60:15</a>), possibly also in the sense that the gracious presence of God will never be withdrawn from it again (the antithesis to &#8219;a&#774;zu&#772;bha&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>). &#1504;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492; is the third pers. pr., like nucha&#770;ma&#770;h in <a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a> : the perfect as expressing the abstract present (Ges. 126, 3). <p>The following prophecy anticipates the question, how Israel can possibly rejoice in the recovered possession of its inheritance, if it is still to be surrounded by such malicious neighbours as the Edomites. </body></html>
