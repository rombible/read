In unsurpassed eloquence Isaiah describes the greatness, grace, and glory of God, the virgin birth, dual nature, earthly life, sufferings and resurrection of the promised Messiah. The author also writes extensively regarding the terrors of the coming tribulation and wonders of the millennium. The nation Israel is one of Isaiah’s main themes as he denounces the sin of his people, pronounces future judgment and announces Israel’s restoration.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">FROM THE REVOLT OF SATAN TO THE RULE OF THE SAVIOR. HERE IT IS, AS TOLD BY SCRIPTURE’S MOST ELOQUENT PROPHET.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Isaiah is the Shakespeare of the prophets, and the St. Paul of the Old Testament. This marvelous manuscript has been regarded almost universally as by far the greatest and grandest treatise on the most important subject in the history of writing – Christ and his salvation. The book’s significance and sheer eloquence simply cannot be overstated.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Isaiah has more to say about the greatness of God (ch. 40, 43), the horrors of the tribulation (24), the wonders of the millennium (35), and the ministry of Christ (53), than any other biblical book. Isaiah probably contains the most important and far-reaching chapter in the entire Old Testament – chapter 53. This amazing chapter alone is quoted from or alluded to some 85 times in the New Testament. Jesus said that Isaiah saw his glory and spoke of him (Jn. 12:41). This book is really an extended commentary on Jonah 2:9, when that prophet exclaimed from the fish’s belly, <i>“Salvation is of the Lord.”</i> The word salvation appears 33 times in the writing of the prophets, and of these, 26 instances occur in Isaiah.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Ronald Youngblood writes:<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“The measure of any book’s greatness is not to be looked for in the quantity of its lines or paragraphs or pages but in the quality of its contents. The book of Isaiah is great because of the breadth of its teachings, because of the importance of its message, because of the sweep of its subject matter. The Colorado River has many gorges, but none is so magnificent as the Grand Canyon: 280 miles long, 4 to 18 miles wide and over a mile deep, it beckons to the visitor to marvel at its beauty and plumb its depths again and again. In much the same way the Old Testament has many prophetic books, but none is so magnificent as Isaiah: sixty-six chapters long and thus a miniature Bible in itself. It beckons to the reader to revel in its beauty and plumb its teachings again and again.” (<i>Themes from Isaiah.</i> Royal Books.
