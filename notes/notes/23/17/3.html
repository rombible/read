or, that at what time Damascus should be overthrown, and deprived of all government and power, the Ephraimites also should be weakened, and deprived of their chief fortresses by the Assyrians; which latter seems to be the true sense: see <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm" title="Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.">Hosea 10:14</a>; <a href="/micah/1-6.htm" title="Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.">Micah 1:6</a>. The reader will observe, the Syrians of Damascus bordered upon the Ephraimites; and though they had long lived in a state of hostility with them, yet their King Rezin, on receiving some injuries from Uzziah, king of Judah, had found means to unite them with him in an expedition against Jerusalem. As the design of that expedition was wholly frustrated, (see <a href="/context/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;...">Isaiah 7:3-9</a>,) so it hastened the destruction of both those nations: for the Assyrians, who were called in by Ahaz to his help, and who had a long time threatened Syria, took this occasion to seize and destroy Damascus, and transport the Damascene Syrians to Assyria and Media, which same fate, partly at the same time, and partly a little after, befell the Ephraimites also; a common cause involving these nations in a common calamity. <span class="ital">In that day, the glory of Jacob shall be made thin </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ירל</span>, <span class="ital">attenuabitur, shall be diminished, emptied, </span>or <span class="ital">exhausted. And the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean </span>— Their principal citizens shall be spoiled of their dignity and wealth, and carried, with their property, into Assyria. <span class="ital">And it shall be as when a harvest-man gathereth the corn </span>— Taking care, as far as may be, that all be gathered in, and nothing left. So shall the whole body of the ten tribes be carried captive, some few gleanings only being left of them as it is in harvest. <span class="ital">As he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim </span>— A very fruitful place near Jerusalem. Thus “the prophet explains the judgment upon Ephraim by two similes, and both elegant; the first taken from a beautiful body reduced by a consumption, meaning that their state should be deprived, not only of its chief citizens, but of all its power, wealth, and honour; that whatever it formerly possessed, which gave excellence and beauty, should entirely waste away and be consumed. The second simile is taken from the autumnal gathering in of fruits, or from that fertile harvest, whether of corn, wine, or oil, which used to be gathered in the valley of Rephaim.” <span class="ital">Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, </span>&c. — “Whereas the reapers are wont to leave a few ears of corn, and those that gather grapes and olives, a few of the worst bunches of the grapes, and of the worst berries of the olives, so, from the harvest, which the Assyrian should reap in Ephraim, a few men, and those of the least consequence, should be left as a remnant in the land.” This accordingly came to pass: some few Israelites were left after their captivity, who joined themselves to Judah, and were carried captive to Babylon with them, from whence also they returned with them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin, and its certain consequences.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fortress - The strong place of defense; the fortified place.<p>Shall cease - Shall come to an end; shall cease to be, for so the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;  sha&#770;bath is often used, <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-8.htm">Isaiah 24:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-15.htm">Lamentations 5:15</a>.<p>From Ephraim - The name given to the kingdom of Israel, or to the ten tribes, because Ephraim was the largest of the ten, and was a leading tribe in their councils (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>).

The ten tribes, now in confederacy with the Syrians, whose metropolis or fortress was Samaria, which seems to be intended here; and should be destroyed, at least taken out of the hands of the Israelites, and they be carried captive by Shalmaneser king of Assyria, <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> and this may be understood, not of that particular city and fortress only, but of all their strongholds, the singular being, put for the plural. The Targum is, "the government shall cease from Ephraim"; they shall have no more a king over them, nor have they to this day: <p>and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria; Damascus was the head city of Syria, where the kings of Syria had their palace; but now that and the rest of Syria should no more be a kingdom of itself, but should be subject unto others, as it has been ever since: <p>they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts; that is, the Syrians, who were in alliance with Israel, should share the same fate; should be carried captive as they were; should have their metropolis and other cities, and their whole kingdom, taken from them, and be stripped of their grandeur and wealth, and have no more glory than they had; which was none at all; or at least very small, as the next verse shows <a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fortress also shall cease from <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.</span><p>(d) It seems that the prophet would comfort the Church in declaring the destruction of these two kings of Syria and Israel, when as they had conspired the overthrow of Judah.<p>(e) The ten tribes gloried in their multitude and alliance with other nations: therefore he says that they will be brought down and the Syrians also.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">The fortress also … Ephraim</span>] Perhaps: <span class="bld">And the bulwark shall be removed from Ephraim</span>, meaning the kingdom of Damascus, which had been like a breakwater, sheltering Israel from the Assyrian onslaught. It is, however, equally possible to understand the “fortress” of Samaria, or collectively of the fortified cities of North Israel; and the parallelism with the next clause may be thought to favour this sense. But the mention of Samaria seems premature in this stanza, which deals with the ruin of Syria.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the remnant of Syria: they shall be</span>] A.V. here follows the accentuation of the Hebrew; it is better to neglect it and render <span class="bld">and the remnant of Syria shall be</span>, &c., letting the first member of the verse end with “Damascus.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim</span>. Sargon did not destroy Samaria on the occasion of his first capture. But he says that he "reduced it to a heap of ruins" on the occasion of its second capture ('Records of the Past,' <span class="accented">l.s</span>.<span class="accented">c</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And the kingdom from Damascus</span>. We do not hear of any King of Damascus after Rezin, who was slain by Tiglath-Pileser about  <span class="date">B.C. 732</span>. Damascus, however, reasserted her independence in  <span class="date">B.C. 721</span>, and probably set up a king at the same time. In  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> she was reduced and destroyed. Nothing more is heard of her until  <span class="date">B.C. 694</span> - the eleventh year of Sen-nacherib - when her "governor" is Assyrian Eponym, and she must therefore have been absorbed into the Assyrian empire. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Syria</span>. This phrase shows that the great blow which struck down Syria - Tiglath-Pileser's capture of Damascus and slaughter of Rezin - was a thing of the past. Syria was already but "a remnant." Now she was to cease to exist altogether. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel</span>. Ironical. The irony is made apparent by the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet, to whose favourite words and favourite figures Carmel belongs, both as the name of a place and as the name of a thing, now proceeds with his picture, and is plunged still more deeply into mourning. "And joy is taken away, and the rejoicing of the garden-land; and there is no exulting, no shouting in the vineyards: the treader treads out no wine in the presses; I put an end to the Hedad. Therefore my bowels sound for Moab like a harp, and my inside for Kir-heres." It is Jehovah who says "I put an end;" and consequently the words, "My bowels sound like a harp," or, as Jeremiah expresses it (<a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>), like flutes, might appear to be expressive of the feelings of Jehovah. And the Scriptures do not hesitate to attribute me&#772;&#8219;ayim (viscera) to God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>). But as the prophet is the sympathizing subject throughout the whole of the prophecy, it is better, for the sake of unity, to take the words in this instance also as expressing the prophet's feelings. Just as the hand or plectrum touches the strings of the harp, so that they vibrate with sound; so did the terrible things that he had heard Jehovah say concerning Moab touch the strings of his inward parts, and cause them to resound with notes of pain. By the bowels, or rather entrails (viscera), the heart, liver, and kidneys are intended - the highest organs of the Psyche, and the sounding-board, as it were, of those "hidden sounds" which exist in every man. God conversed with the prophet "in the spirit;" but what passed there took the form of individual impressions in the domain of the soul, in which impressions the bodily organs of the psychical life sympathetically shared. Thus the prophet saw in the spirit the purpose of God concerning Moab, in which he could not and would not make any change; but it threw his soul into all the restlessness of pain. </body></html>
