After the prophet had exhibited the divine judgments upon the Syrians, (<a href="/context/isaiah/17-1.htm" title="The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap....">Isaiah 17:1-3</a>,) and upon the Ephraimites, (<a href="/context/isaiah/17-4.htm" title="And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean....">Isaiah 17:4-11</a>,) he immediately beholds the Assyrians themselves, after they had destroyed both those states, (that is, eight years after,) advancing against the Jews, that they might oppress and subject to them their state also. But, at the same time, he sees their grievous and sudden fall, that is, the fall of Sennacherib; for almost all ancient and modern interpreters are agreed that this prophecy refers to him.” <span class="ital">Wo to the multitude of many people </span>— Combined against Judah, namely, the Assyrians, whose army consisted of vast numbers, and of men of several nations. <span class="ital">Which make a noise like the noise of the seas </span>— Which invade my land and people with great force and fury, as the sea assaults the shore, or pours itself upon the land, when it has made a breach in the banks which before confined it. <span class="ital">And to the rushing of nations — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לאמים שׁאון</span>, <span class="ital">tumultuatio populorum, </span>the noise, rage, and impetuous fury of the people of different countries united in one mighty overwhelming army. Bishop Lowth translates the clause, <span class="ital">And to the roaring of the nations, who make a roaring like the roaring of mighty waters. Like the roaring of mighty waters do the nations roar. </span>And he observes that, “though this simile is taken from a common appearance, it is wrought up with such an elegant boldness and inexpressible propriety, that we are at a loss whether we should admire most the judgment or sublimity of the sacred writer.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But God shall rebuke them </span>— Not in words, but in deeds; shall discomfit and overthrow them. But the Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">וגער בו ונס</span>, should rather be rendered, <span class="ital">But God rebukes him, and he flees from far, </span>namely, Sennacherib, who is here immediately pointed out, one hundred and eighty- five thousand of his army being smitten with instantaneous death. The prophet’s idea seems to have been taken from God’s rebuke of the sea, when the Israelites passed through out of Egypt. <span class="ital">And they shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains </span>— The Jews used to thrash and winnow their corn on hills and places exposed to the wind, which dispersed and blew away the chaff; <span class="ital">and like a rolling thing </span>— Which is moved by the slightest touch, and much more by a violent wind. The word, which is <span class="greekheb">גלגל</span>, is rendered <span class="ital">thistle-down </span>in the margin, and <span class="ital">gossamer, </span>which is the down of any plants, by Bishop Lowth. The metaphor shows with what ease God overcomes his enemies. <span class="ital">And behold at even-tide trouble </span>— Great terror and consternation among God’s people for fear of their enemies; <span class="ital">and before the morning he is not </span>— Their enemies are cut off by the hand of God. The prophet here evidently “alludes to the time and circumstances of the judgment which was inflicted on the Assyrian by night, and indeed in one night. At even-tide the Jews were certainly in great terror, perplexity, and perturbation, when besieged by the Assyrians: in the morning, behold these their enemies <span class="ital">were all dead corpses. </span>Such is the sudden and unexpected deliverance which God sometimes grants to his people, when their enemies are ready to devour them: <span class="ital">weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. This is the portion of them that spoil us,</span> &c. — This is a triumphant conclusion, uttered by the prophet in the name of God’s people. “It holds good in all ages of the church; none can endeavour to remove this stone from its place, but they will find hurt to themselves, <a href="/zechariah/12-3.htm" title="And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.">Zechariah 12:3</a>. In this one example we see the fall of all the great empires and kingdoms of the world which oppose the kingdom of Christ, and the event of all the attempts of Satan tending to its destruction: in the evening, confusion; in the morning, serenity, arising by divine grace on the church.” See Vitringa. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:12-14 The rage and force of the Assyrians resembled the mighty waters of the sea; but when the God of Israel should rebuke them, they would flee like chaff, or like a rolling thing, before the whirlwind. In the evening Jerusalem would be in trouble, because of the powerful invader, but before morning his army would be nearly cut off. Happy are those who remember God as their salvation, and rely on his power and grace. The trouble of the believers, and the prosperity of their enemies, will be equally short; while the joy of the former, and the destruction of those that hate and spoil them, shall last for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wo to the multitude ... - The word 'woe' (&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;  ho&#770;y) may be either an interjection simply directing the attention to them, or it may be a word indicating approaching calamity and judgment (see the note at <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>).

The first half of the verse should be rendered: <span class="bld">Ah, the roar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of seas</span>. The “many peoples” are the varied subject nationalities that furnished contingents to the Assyrian army. The comparison of such tumultuous masses of men to the noise of waters is frequent in the O.T.: cf. ch. <a href="/isaiah/5-30.htm" title="And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.">Isaiah 5:30</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm" title="They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array as men for war against you, O daughter of Zion.">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-7.htm" title="Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?">Jeremiah 46:7</a> f.; <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm" title="Which stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.">Psalm 65:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/isaiah/17-12.htm" title="Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!...">Isaiah 17:12-14</a>.

Since the reference here is undoubtedly to the Assyrians, the first view has nothing to commend it, the transition being too sudden and abrupt. The second view, in spite of identity of subject and a certain similarity in form with ch. 18, is also improbable because of the well-marked conclusion in <span class="ital"><a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm" title="And behold at evening trouble; and before the morning he is not.

It is better, therefore, to treat the passage as a short independent oracle springing from the same historical situation as the following chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST ASSYRIA. This passage is, apparently, out of place. At any rate, it is quite unconnected with what precedes, and almost equally so with what follows. Still, it must be borne in mind that, until the destruction of Sennacherib's army, Isaiah has the thought of the Assyrians, as the pressing danger, always before him, and continually reverts to it, often abruptly, and without preparation (see <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-5.htm">Isaiah 8:5-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19, 24-34</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>). The present prophecy seems, more distinctly than any other in the purely prophetical chapters, to point to the miraculous destruction of the hoot which Sennacherib was about to bring against Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the multitude of many people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho for the tumult of many peoples!</span> The advance of an army composed of soldiers from many nations is descried. They advance with noise and tumult - a tumult compared with that of "seas that are tumultuous." Under the circumstances of the time, it is reasonable to suppose the Assyrians to be intended (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6, 7</a>). The rushing sound of the advance is borne in strongly upon the prophet's mind, and made the subject of three consecutive clauses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Second turn: "And it comes to pass in that day, the glory of Jacob wastes away, and the fat of his flesh grows thin. And it will be as when a reaper grasps the stalks of wheat, and his arm mows off the ears; and it will be as with one who gathers together ears in the valley of Rephaim. Yet a gleaning remains from it, as at the olive-beating: two, three berries high up at the top; four, five in its, the fruit tree's, branches, saith Jehovah the God of Israel. At that day will man look up to his Creator, and his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. And he will not look to the altars, the work of his hands; and what his fingers have made he will not regard, neither the Astartes nor the sun-gods." This second turn does not speak of Damascus, but simply of Israel, and in fact of all Israel, the range of vision widening out from Israel in the more restricted sense, so as to embrace the whole. It will all disappear, with the exception of a small remnant; but the latter will return. Thus "a remnant will return," the law of Israel's history, which is here shown first of all in its threatening aspect, and then in its more promising one. The reputation and prosperity to which the two kingdoms were raised by Jeroboam II and Uzziah would pass away. Israel was ripe for judgment, like a field of corn for the harvest; and it would be as when a reaper grasps the stalks that have shot up, and cuts off the ears. &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is not used elliptically for &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Gesenius), nor is it a definition of time (Luzzatto), nor an accusative of the object (Knobel), but a noun formed like &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;, and used in the sense of reaper (ko&#772;tze&#772;r in other cases).<p>(Note: Instead of ka&#770;tzar (to cut off, or shorten), they now say ka&#770;ratz in the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan, which gives the idea of sawing off - a much more suitable one where the Syrian sickle is used.)<p>The figure suggested here is more fully expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. Hardly a single one will escape the judgment: just as in the broad plain of Rephaim, which slopes off to the south-west of Jerusalem as far as Bethlehem, where it is covered with rich fields of wheat, the collectors of ears leave only one or two ears lying scattered here and there.<p>Nevertheless a gleaning of Israel ("in it," viz., in Jacob, <a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>) will be left, just as when the branches of the olive tree, which have been already cleared with the hand, are still further shaken with a stick, there still remain a few olives upon the highest branch (two, three; cf., <a href="/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32</a>), or concealed under the foliage of the branches. "Its, the fruit tree's, branches:" this is an elegant expression, as, for example, in <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>; the carrying over of the &#1492; to the second word is very natural in both passages (see Ges. 121, b). This small remnant will turn with stedfast gaze to the living God, as is becoming in man as such (ha&#770;'a&#770;da&#770;m), and not regard the idols as worthy of any look at all, at least of any reverential look. As hamma&#770;nim are here images of the sun-god &#1495;&#1502;&#1503; &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;, which is well known from the Phoenician monuments,<p>(Note: See Levy, Phnizisches Wrterbuch (1864), p. 19; and Otto Strauss on Nahum, p. xxii. ss.)<p>ashe&#772;rim (for which we find, though more rarely, 'ashe&#772;roth) apparently signifies images of the moon-goddess. And the combination of "Baal, Asherah, and all the host of heaven" in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>, as well as the surname "queen of heaven" in <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18-19</a>, appears to require this (Knobel). But the latest researches have proved that 'Ashe&#772;ra&#770;h is rather the Semitic Aphrodite, and therefore the planet Venus, which was called the "little luck" (es-sa&#8219;d el-as'gar)<p>(Note: See Krehl, Religion der vorislamischen Araber (1863), p. 11.)<p>by the Arabs, in distinction from Musteri (Jupiter),<p>(Note: This was the tutelar deity of Damascus; see Comm. on Job, Appendix.)<p>or "the great luck." And with this the name 'Asherah the "lucky" (i.e., the source of luck or prosperity) and the similar surname given to the Assyrian Istar agree;<p>(Note: "Ishtar," says Rawlinson in his Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World, - a work which challenges criticism through its dazzling results - "Ishtar is the goddess who rejoices mankind, and her most common epithet is Amra, 'the fortunate' or 'the happy.' But otherwise her epithets are vague and general, insomuch that she is often scarcely distinguishable from Beltis (the wife of Bel-Nimrod)." Vid., vol. i. p. 175 (1862).)<p>for 'Asherah is the very same goddess as 'Ashtoreth, whose name is thoroughly Arian, and apparently signifies the star (Ved. stir  equals  star; Zend. stare; Neo-Pers. sita&#770;re, used chiefly for the morning star), although Rawlinson (without being able to suggest any more acceptable interpretation) speaks of this view as "not worthy of much attention."<p>(Note: The planet Venus, according to a Midrash relating to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-2</a>, is 'Istehar transferred to the sky; and this is the same as Zuhare (see Geiger, Was hat Muhammed, etc. 1833, pp. 107-109).)<p>Thus Asherim is used to signify the bosquets (shrubberies) or trees dedicated to the Semitic Aphrodite (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; compare the verbs used to signify their removal, &#1490;&#1491;&#1506;, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514;, &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;); but here it probably refers to her statues or images<p>continued...</body></html>
