They had forsaken the One, and therefore, by a just retribution, the others should be forsaken.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">thou didst plant. </span>The word for “pleasant” is found here only as a common noun. The singular appears as a proper name in <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a>, <a href="/numbers/26-40.htm" title="And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family of the Ardites: and of Naaman, the family of the Naamites.">Numbers 26:40</a>, and in the more familiar instance of <span class= "ital">Naaman the Syrian </span>(<a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm" title="Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.">2Kings 5:1</a>). It would appear that the prophet chose the peculiar term to indicate the foreign, in this case the Syrian, character of the worship to which he refers as the “plant” which Israel had adopted. Mr. Cheyne, following an ingenious suggestion of Lagarde’s, connects it (1) with the Arabic <span class= "ital">Nahr No’man, </span>the name of the river Belus near Acre, and (2) with the Arabic name (<span class= "ital">Shakaiku-’n-nomân</span>) for the red anemone. The former was near the head-quarters of the worship of Thammuz, the Phœnician Adonis, and the flower was sacred to him, and so it is inferred that the prophet refers to “the gardens of Adonis,” fair but perishable (Plato, <span class= "ital">Phœdr. </span>p. 276 B), in which Israel had delighted (<a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>). The addition of “strange slips,” literally, <span class= "ital">vine-slips of a strange one—</span>i.e., of a strange god (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>)—confirms at least the general drift of this interpretation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/17.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE HARVEST OF A GODLESS LIFE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/17-10.htm" title="Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of your strength, therefore shall you plant pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips:">Isaiah 17:10</a> - <a href="/isaiah/17-11.htm" title="In the day shall you make your plant to grow, and in the morning shall you make your seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.">Isaiah 17:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The original application of these words is to Judah’s alliance with Damascus, which Isaiah was dead against. He saw that it would only precipitate the Assyrian invasion, as in fact it did. Judah had forsaken God, and because they had done so, they had gone to seek for themselves delights-alliance with Damascus. The image of planting a garden of pleasures, and ‘vine slips of a stranger’ refers to sensuous idolatry as well as to the entangling alliance. Then follows a contemptuous description of the rapid growth of this alliance and of the care with which Israel cultivated it. ‘In a day thou makest thy plant to grow’ {or fencest it}, and next morning it was in blossom, so sedulously had they nursed and fostered it. Then comes the smiting contrast of what it was all for-’A harvest heap in the day of sickness and incurable pain.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now we may take this in a more general way as containing large truths which affect the life of every one of us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Sin of a Godless Life.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} Notice the Sin charged. It is merely negative-<span class="ital">forgettest</span>. There is no charge of positive hostility or of any overt act. This forgetfulness is most natural and easy to be fallen into. The constant pressure of the world. It indicates alienation of heart from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is most common among us, far more so than active infidelity, far more so than gross sin, far more so than conscious hostility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} The implied Criminality of it. He is the ‘Rock of thy strength’ and the ‘God of thy salvation.’ Rock is the grand Old Testament name of God, expressing in a pregnant metaphor both what He is in Himself and what in relation to those who trust Him. It speaks of stability, elevation, massiveness, and of defence and security. The parallel title sets Him forth as the Giver of salvation; and both names set in clear light the sinful ingratitude of forgetting God, and force home the question: ‘Do ye thus requite the Lord, oh foolish people and unwise?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} The implied Absurdity of it. What a contrast between the safe ‘munitions of rocks’ and the unsheltered security of these Damascene gardens! What fools to leave the heights and come down into the plain! Think of the contrast between the sufficiency of God and the emptiness of the substitutes. Forgetfulness of Him and preference of creatures cannot be put into language which does not convict it of absurdity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The Busy Effort and Apparent Success of a Godless Life.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} If a man loses his hold on God and has not Him to stay himself on, he is driven to painful efforts to make up the loss. God is needed by every soul. If the soul is not satisfied in Him, then there are hungry desires. This is the explanation of the feverish activity of much of our life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} Such work is far harder than the work of serving God. It takes a great deal of toil to make that garden grow. The world is a hard taskmaster. God’s service is easy. He sets us in Eden to till and dress it, but when we forget Him, the ground is cursed, and bears thorns and thistles, and sweat drips from our brows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Men take more pains to damn themselves than to save themselves. There is nothing more wearying than the pursuit of pleasure. ‘Pleasant plants’-that is a hopeless kind of gardening. There is nothing more degrading.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Ye lust and desire to have,’-what a contrast is in, Ask and have! We might live even as the lilies or the ravens, or with only this difference, that we laboured, but were as uncaring and as peaceful as they.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God is <span class="ital">given</span>. The world has to be <span class="ital">bought</span>. Its terms are ‘Nothing for nothing.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} Such work has sometimes quick, present success.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘In the day.’ It is hard for men to labour towards far-off unseen good. We like to have what will grow up in a night, like Jonah’s gourd. So these present satisfactions in a worldly life appeal to worldly, sensuous natures. And it is hard to set over against these a plant which grows slowly, and only bears fruit in the next world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The End of it all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘A harvest heap in the day of grief.’ This clearly points on to a solemn ending-the day of judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} How poor the fruit will he that a God-forgetting man will take out of life! There is but <span class="ital">one heap</span> from all the long struggle. He has ‘sowed much and brought home little.’ What shall we take with us out of our busy years as their net result? A very small sack will be large enough to hold the harvest that many of us have reaped.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} All this God-forgetting life of pleasure-seeking and idolatry is bringing on a terrible, inevitable consummation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No doubt there is often a harvest of grief and desperate sorrow springing, even in this life, from forgetting God. For it is only they who set their hopes on Him that are never disappointed, and only they who have chosen Him for their portion who can always say, ‘I have a goodly heritage.’ But the real harvest is not reaped till death has separated the time of sowing from that of ingathering. The sower shall reap; <span class="ital">i.e</span>. every man shall inherit the consequences of his deeds. ‘They that have planted it shall eat it.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} That harvest home will be a day of sadness to some. These are terrible words-’grief and desperate sorrow,’ or ‘pain and incurable sickness.’ We dare not dilate on this. But if we trust in Christ and sow to the Spirit, we shall then ‘rejoice before God as with the joy of harvest,’ and ‘return with joy, bringing our sheaves with us.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/17-10.htm" title="Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of your strength, therefore shall you plant pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips:...">Isaiah 17:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because thou, </span>O Israel, <span class="ital">hast forgotten the God of thy salvation </span>— That God, who was thy only sure defence; <span class="ital">therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants </span>— Fetched from far countries, and therefore highly esteemed.

It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain.

A rock of strength is a strongly fortified place; or a rock which an enemy could not successfully assail.

The supposed reference is to the Adonis-gardens mentioned by Greek writers (see Plato, <span class="ital">Phaedrus</span> 276). They were “pots of quickly withering flowers which the ancients used to set at their doors or in the courts of temples.” It cannot be denied that such an allusion furnishes the most striking image conceivable of the futility of all human projects which (like the Syro-Ephraimitish alliance) are not grounded in the eternal moral purpose of Jehovah. The question is whether it is a fair interpretation of the text. Now, there are a number of scattered proofs, slight but very interesting, that the Syrian deity known to the Greeks as Adonis, actually bore the name here rendered “pleasantness” (<span class="ital">Na‘ǎmân</span>). It has been suggested, e.g. that the <span class="ital">anemone</span>, the flower sacred to Adonis, derives its name from this title of the god; and in Arabic the red anemone is called by a name which is explained to mean “wounds of Adonis.” For other arguments see Cheyne’s <span class="ital">Comm</span>. and the references there. Adonis being a Syrian deity, his worship in Israel was a necessary consequence of the alliance with Damascus.

Israel, instead of looking to this "Rock," had looked to their rock-fortresses (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dost thou plant</span>, or <span class="accented">hast thou planted</span>. Forgetfulness of Jehovah has led to the adoption of a voluptuous religion - one of debased foreign rites. There is possibly, as Mr. Cheyne thinks, a special reference to the cult of Adonis. <span class="cmt_word">Shall set it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">settest it</span>, or <span class="accented">hast set it</span>. "It" must refer to "field" or "garden" understood. The later Israelite religion has been a sort of pleasant garden, planted with exotic slips from various quarters - Phoenicia, Syria, Moab, etc. It has been thought permissible to introduce into it any new cult that took the fancy. Hence the multiplication of altars complained of by Hosea (<a href="/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Second turn: "And it comes to pass in that day, the glory of Jacob wastes away, and the fat of his flesh grows thin. And it will be as when a reaper grasps the stalks of wheat, and his arm mows off the ears; and it will be as with one who gathers together ears in the valley of Rephaim. Yet a gleaning remains from it, as at the olive-beating: two, three berries high up at the top; four, five in its, the fruit tree's, branches, saith Jehovah the God of Israel. At that day will man look up to his Creator, and his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. And he will not look to the altars, the work of his hands; and what his fingers have made he will not regard, neither the Astartes nor the sun-gods." This second turn does not speak of Damascus, but simply of Israel, and in fact of all Israel, the range of vision widening out from Israel in the more restricted sense, so as to embrace the whole. It will all disappear, with the exception of a small remnant; but the latter will return. Thus "a remnant will return," the law of Israel's history, which is here shown first of all in its threatening aspect, and then in its more promising one. The reputation and prosperity to which the two kingdoms were raised by Jeroboam II and Uzziah would pass away. Israel was ripe for judgment, like a field of corn for the harvest; and it would be as when a reaper grasps the stalks that have shot up, and cuts off the ears. &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is not used elliptically for &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Gesenius), nor is it a definition of time (Luzzatto), nor an accusative of the object (Knobel), but a noun formed like &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;, and used in the sense of reaper (ko&#772;tze&#772;r in other cases).<p>(Note: Instead of ka&#770;tzar (to cut off, or shorten), they now say ka&#770;ratz in the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan, which gives the idea of sawing off - a much more suitable one where the Syrian sickle is used.)<p>The figure suggested here is more fully expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. Hardly a single one will escape the judgment: just as in the broad plain of Rephaim, which slopes off to the south-west of Jerusalem as far as Bethlehem, where it is covered with rich fields of wheat, the collectors of ears leave only one or two ears lying scattered here and there.<p>Nevertheless a gleaning of Israel ("in it," viz., in Jacob, <a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>) will be left, just as when the branches of the olive tree, which have been already cleared with the hand, are still further shaken with a stick, there still remain a few olives upon the highest branch (two, three; cf., <a href="/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32</a>), or concealed under the foliage of the branches. "Its, the fruit tree's, branches:" this is an elegant expression, as, for example, in <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>; the carrying over of the &#1492; to the second word is very natural in both passages (see Ges. 121, b). This small remnant will turn with stedfast gaze to the living God, as is becoming in man as such (ha&#770;'a&#770;da&#770;m), and not regard the idols as worthy of any look at all, at least of any reverential look. As hamma&#770;nim are here images of the sun-god &#1495;&#1502;&#1503; &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;, which is well known from the Phoenician monuments,<p>(Note: See Levy, Phnizisches Wrterbuch (1864), p. 19; and Otto Strauss on Nahum, p. xxii. ss.)<p>ashe&#772;rim (for which we find, though more rarely, 'ashe&#772;roth) apparently signifies images of the moon-goddess. And the combination of "Baal, Asherah, and all the host of heaven" in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>, as well as the surname "queen of heaven" in <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18-19</a>, appears to require this (Knobel). But the latest researches have proved that 'Ashe&#772;ra&#770;h is rather the Semitic Aphrodite, and therefore the planet Venus, which was called the "little luck" (es-sa&#8219;d el-as'gar)<p>(Note: See Krehl, Religion der vorislamischen Araber (1863), p. 11.)<p>by the Arabs, in distinction from Musteri (Jupiter),<p>(Note: This was the tutelar deity of Damascus; see Comm. on Job, Appendix.)<p>or "the great luck." And with this the name 'Asherah the "lucky" (i.e., the source of luck or prosperity) and the similar surname given to the Assyrian Istar agree;<p>(Note: "Ishtar," says Rawlinson in his Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World, - a work which challenges criticism through its dazzling results - "Ishtar is the goddess who rejoices mankind, and her most common epithet is Amra, 'the fortunate' or 'the happy.' But otherwise her epithets are vague and general, insomuch that she is often scarcely distinguishable from Beltis (the wife of Bel-Nimrod)." Vid., vol. i. p. 175 (1862).)<p>for 'Asherah is the very same goddess as 'Ashtoreth, whose name is thoroughly Arian, and apparently signifies the star (Ved. stir  equals  star; Zend. stare; Neo-Pers. sita&#770;re, used chiefly for the morning star), although Rawlinson (without being able to suggest any more acceptable interpretation) speaks of this view as "not worthy of much attention."<p>(Note: The planet Venus, according to a Midrash relating to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-2</a>, is 'Istehar transferred to the sky; and this is the same as Zuhare (see Geiger, Was hat Muhammed, etc. 1833, pp. 107-109).)<p>Thus Asherim is used to signify the bosquets (shrubberies) or trees dedicated to the Semitic Aphrodite (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; compare the verbs used to signify their removal, &#1490;&#1491;&#1506;, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514;, &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;); but here it probably refers to her statues or images<p>continued...</body></html>
