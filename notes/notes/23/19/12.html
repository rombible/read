He will raise up the causes of their destruction from among themselves. When ungodly men escape danger, they are apt to think themselves secure; but evil pursues sinners, and will speedily overtake them, except they repent. The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rule them with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians were renowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up to their own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would be brought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. He renders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed; and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror to themselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Where are they? - This whole verse is an appeal by the prophet to the king of Egypt respecting the counselors and soothsayers of his kingdom. The sense is, 'a time of distress and danger is evidently coming upon Egypt. They pretend to be wise; and there is now occasion for all their wisdom, and opportunity to evince it. Let them show it. Let them declare what is coming upon the nation, and take proper measures to meet and remove it; and they will then demonstrate that it would be proper for Pharaoh to repose confidence in them.' But if they could not do this, then he should not suffer himself to be deluded, and his kingdom ruined, by their counsels. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. let them know&#8212;that is, How is it that, with all their boast of knowing the future [Diodorus, 1.81], they do not know what Jehovah of hosts &#8230;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy wise men; </span> who pretended that either by their deep policy, or by their skill in astrology or magic, they could certainly foresee things to come. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Where are they? where are thy wise men?....

"And the waters will dry up from the sea, and the river is parched and dried. And the arms of the river spread a stench; the channels of Matzor become shallow and parched: reed and rush shrivel up. The meadows by the Nile, on the border of the Nile, and every corn-field of the Nile, dries up, is scattered, and disappears. And the fishermen groan, and all who throw draw-nets into the Nile lament, and they that spread out the net upon the face of the waters languish away. And the workers of fine combed flax are confounded, and the weavers of cotton fabrics. And the pillars of the land are ground to powder; all that work for wages are troubled in mind." In <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a> the Nile is called ya&#770;m (a sea), just as Homer calls it Oceanus, which, as Diodorus observes, was the name given by the natives to the river (Egypt. oham). The White Nile is called bahr el-abyad (the White Sea), the Blue Nile bahr el-azrak, and the combined waters bahr en&#775;Nil, or, in the language of the Besharn, as here in Isaiah, ya&#772;m. And in the account of the creation, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, yammim is the collective name for great seas and rivers. But the Nile itself is more like an inland sea than a river, from the point at which the great bodies of water brought down by the Blue Nile and the White Nile, which rises a few weeks later, flow together; partly on account of its great breadth, and partly also because of its remaining stagnant throughout the dry season. It is not till the tropical rains commence that the swelling river begins to flow more rapidly, and the ya&#770;m becomes a na&#770;ha&#770;r. But when, as is here threatened, the Nile sea and Nile river in Upper Egypt sink together and dry up (nisshethu, niphal either of sha&#770;thath  equals  na&#770;shattu, to set, to grow shallow; or more probably from na&#770;shath, to dry up, since <a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a> warrant the assumption that there was such a verb), the mouths (or arms) of the Nile (neha&#770;r), which flow through the Delta, and the many canals (ye'orim), by which the benefits of the overflow are conveyed to the Nile valley, are turned into stinking puddles (&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, a hiphil, half substantive half verbal, unparalleled elsewhere,<p>(Note: It is not unparalleled as a hiph. denom. (compare &#1492;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;, oil, &#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;, to press, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>, Talm. &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;, to become worm-eaten, and many others of a similar kind); and as a mixed form (possibly a mixture of two readings, as Gesenius and Bttcher suppose, though it is not necessarily so), the language admitted of much that was strange, more especially in the vulgar tongue, which found its way here and there into written composition.)<p>signifying to spread a stench; possibly it may have been used in the place of &#1492;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, from &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495; or &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495;, stinking, to which a different application was given in ordinary use). In all probability it is not without intention that Isaiah uses the expression Ma&#770;tzor, inasmuch as he distinguishes Ma&#770;zort from Pathros (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>), i.e., Lower from Upper Egypt (Egyp. sa-het, the low land, and sa-res, the higher land), the two together being Mitzrayim. And ye'orim (by the side of neha&#770;roth) we are warranted in regarding as the name given of the Nile canals. The canal system in Egypt and the system of irrigation are older than the invasion of the Hyksos (vid., Lepsius, in Herzog's Cyclopaedia). On the other hand, ye'o&#772;r in <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm">Isaiah 19:7</a> (where it is written three times plene, as it is also in <a href="/isaiah/19-8.htm">Isaiah 19:8</a>) is the Egyptian name of the Nile generally (yaro).<p>(Note: From the fact that aur in old Egyptian means the Nile, we may explain the &#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, with which the Laterculus of Eratosthenes closes.)<p>It is repeated emphatically three times, like Mitzrayim in <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>. Parallel to mizra&#8219;, but yet different from it, is &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, to be naked or bare, which signifies, like many derivatives of the synonymous word in Arabic, either open spaces, or as here, grassy tracts by the water-side, i.e., meadows. Even the meadows, which lie close to the water-side (pi  equals  ora, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>, not ostium), and all the fields, become so parched, that they blow away like ashes.<p>Then the three leading sources from which Egypt derived its maintenance all fail: - viz. the fishing; the linen manufacture, which supplied dresses for the priests and bandages for mummies; and the cotton manufacture, by which all who were not priests were supplied with clothes. The Egyptian fishery was very important. In the Berlin Museum there is an Egyptian micmoreth with lead attached. The mode of working the flax by means of serika&#770;h, pectinatio (compare &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;, wool-combs, Kelim, 12, 2), is shown on the monuments. In the Berlin Museum there are also Egyptian combs of this description with which the flax was carded. The productions of the Egyptian looms were celebrated in antiquity: cho&#772;ra&#770;y, lit., white cloth (singularet. with the old termination ay), is the general name for cotton fabrics, or the different kinds of byssus that were woven there (compare the &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; of the Rosetta inscription). All the castes, from the highest to the lowest, are not thrown into agonies of despair. The sha&#770;tho&#772;th (an epithet that was probably suggested by the thought of shethi, a warp, Syr. 'ashti, to weave, through the natural association of ideas), i.e., the "pillars" of the land (with a suffix relating to Mitzrayim, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>, and construed as a masculine as at <a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>), were the highest castes, who were the direct supporters of the state edifice; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; cannot mean the citizens engaged in trade, i.e., the middle classes, but such of the people as hired themselves to the employers of labour, and therefore lived upon wages and not upon their own property (&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; is used here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, and not as equivalent to &#1505;&#1499;&#1512;, the dammers-up of the water for the purpose of catching the fish, like &#1505;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, Kelim, 23, 5). </body></html>
