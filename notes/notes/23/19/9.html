When ungodly men escape danger, they are apt to think themselves secure; but evil pursues sinners, and will speedily overtake them, except they repent. The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rule them with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians were renowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up to their own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would be brought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. He renders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed; and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror to themselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover - In addition to the calamities that will come upon the fishermen, the drying up of the river will affect all who are supported by that which the overflowing of its waters produced.<p>They that work in short flax - Egypt was celebrated anciently for producing flax in large quantities, and of a superior quality (see <a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>). The fine linen of Egypt which was manufactured from this is celebrated in Scripture <a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>. The Egyptians had early carried the art of manufacturing linen to a great degree of perfection. As early as the exode of the Hebrews, we find that the art was known by which stuffs made of linen or other materials were curiously worked and embroidered. 'And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen, made with needlework' (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; compare <a href="/exodus/27-16.htm">Exodus 27:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-37.htm">Exodus 36:37</a>). So <a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a> : 'Fine linen, with broidered work from Egypt.' So also Martial refers to embroidery with the needle in Egypt:<p>Haec tibi Memphitis tellus dat munera; victa est<p>Pectine Niliaco jam Babylonis acus.<p>Martial, xiv. <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/50.htm">Ephesians 50</a>.<p>In regard to the "fineness" of the linen which was produced and made in Egypt, we may introduce a statement made by Pliny when speaking of the "nets" which were made there. 'So delicate,' says he, 'were some of them, that they would pass through a man's ring, and a single person could carry a sufficient number of them to surround a whole wood. Julius Lupus, who died while governor of Egypt, had some of those nets, each string of which consisted of 150 threads; a fact perfectly surprising to those who are not aware that the Rhodians preserve to this day, in the temple of Minerva, the remains of a linen corslet, presented to them by Amasis, king of Egypt, whose threads are composed each of 365 fibres.' (Pliny, xix. 1.) Herodotus also mentions this corslet (iii. 47), and also another presented by Amasis to the Lacedemonians, which had been carried off by the Samians: 'It was of linen, ornamented with numerous figures of animals, worked in gold and cotton.<p>Each thread of the corslet was worthy of admiration. For though very fine, every one was composed of 360 other threads, all distinct; the quality being similar to that dedicated to Minerva at Lindus, by the same monarch.' Pliny (xix. 1) mentions four kinds of linen that were particularly celebrated in Egypt - the Tanitic, the Pelusiac, the Butine, and the tentyritic. He also says that the quantity of flax cultivated in Egypt was accounted for, by their exporting linen to Arabia and India. It is now known, also, that the cloth used for enveloping the dead, and which is now found in abundance on the mummies, was "linen." This fact was long doubted, and it was until recently supposed by many that the cloth was made of cotton. This fact that it is linen was settled beyond dispute by some accurate experiments made by Dr. Ure, Mr. Bauer, and Mr. Thompson, with the aid of powerful microscopes.<p>It was found that linen fibres uniformly present a cylindrical form, transparent, and articulated, or jointed like a cane, while the fibres of cotton have the appearance of a flat ribbon, with a hem or border at the edge. In the mummy cloths, it was found, without exception, that the fibres were linen. Vast quantities of linen must, therefore, have been used. The linen of the mummy cloths is generally coarse. The warp usually contains about 90 threads in the inch; the woof about 44. Occasionally, however, very fine linen cloth is found, showing the skill with which the manufacture was executed. Sir John G. Wilkinson observes, that a piece of linen in his possession from Egypt had 540 (or 270 double) threads in one inch in the warp. Some of the cambric which is now manufactured has but 160 threads in the inch in the warp, and 140 in the woof. It is to be remembered, also, that the linen in Egypt was spun by hand, and without the aid of machinery (see, on this whole subject, Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii. pp. 113-142. Ed. Lond. 1837). The word rendered 'fine' here denotes, according to Gesenius, "combed or hatchelled." The word 'fine,' however, expresses the idea with sufficient accuracy. Fine linen was used for clothing; but was so expensive that it was worn chiefly by the rich and by princes <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>.<p>They that weave networks - Margin, 'White-works.' According to Gesenius the word &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;  ho&#770;ra&#770;y means "white linen" - that which is fully bleached. The word &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;  ho&#770;d means "a hole or cavern," but is not applied to cloth. The parallelism seems rather to require that the word should mean 'white,' or that which would correspond to 'fine,' or valuable; and it is not known that the Egyptians had the art of working lace from linen. Saadias supposes that "nets" are meant, as being made with holes or meshes; but it is evident that a finer work is intended than that.<p>Shall be confounded - Hebrew, 'Shall be ashamed.' That is, they shall be thrown out of employment, and not know what to do. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. fine flax&#8212;Gesenius, for "fine," translates, "combed"; fine "linen" was worn by the rich only (Lu 16:19). Egypt was famous for it (Ex 9:31; 1Ki 10:28; Pr 7:16; Eze 27:7). The processes of its manufacture are represented on the Egyptian tombs. Israel learned the art in Egypt (Ex 26:36). The cloth now found on the mummies was linen, as is shown by the microscope. Wilkinson mentions linen from Egypt which has five hundred forty (or two hundred seventy double) threads in one inch in the warp; whereas some modern cambric has but a hundred sixty [Barnes].<p>networks&#8212;rather, white cloth (Es 1:6; 8:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That work in fine flax; </span> that make fine linen, which was one of their best commodities; of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm" title="And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.">1 Kings 10:28</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm" title="Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.">Ezekiel 27:7</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/isaiah/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover they that work in fine flax,....

The Targum renders the whole verse thus, <p>"they shall be confounded which work flax, which they comb, and of it weave nets;'' <p>and so Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it, not of persons that wrought in flax, to make yarn or linen of it; but who combed it, to make nets of it, as follows: <p>and they that weave networks shall be confounded: because they would have no sale for their nets, the fishermen having no use for them, the rivers being dried up. The word for "networks" signifies "holes", because nets are made with holes large enough to let the water through, and so small that the fishes may not get out. Some render the word "white works" (m), white linen, white cloth, of which white garments are made, such as nobles and princes formerly wore; hence, in the Hebrew language, they are called by a name of the same root and signification; but the former sense seems best. <p>(l) is by us rendered "fine"; and so, Ben Melech says, in the Arabic language the best and finest linen is called  and so says Kimchi in Sepher Shorash.; with which Schindler agrees, Arab.  sericum or "muslin"; but it is a question whether this is of so early a date, and especially not fit to make nets of. De Dieu and Bochart think it denotes the colour of the linen, which was yellow, that being the best; but others render it "combed".

And I shut up Egypt in the hand of a hard rule; and a fierce king will reign over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts." Civil war will rage in Egypt (on sicse&#772;c, see at <a href="/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). The people once so shrewd are now at their wits' end; their spirit is quite poured out &#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1492;, with the reduplication removed, for &#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;, according to Ges. 68, Anm. 11 - as, for example, in <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Ezekiel 41:7</a>), so that there is nothing left of either intelligence or resolution. Then (and this is also part of the judgment) they turn for help, in counsel and action, where no help is to be found, viz., to their "nothings" of gods, and the manifold demoniacal arts, of which Egypt could boast of being the primary seat. On the names of the practisers of the black art, see <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>; 'ittim, the mutterers, is from 'a&#770;tat, to squeak (used of a camel-saddle, especially when new), or to rumble (used of an empty stomach): see Lane's Lexicon. But all this is of no avail: Jehovah gives them up (&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, syn. &#1492;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to be ruled over by a hard-hearted and cruel king. The prophecy does not relate to a foreign conqueror, so as to lead us to think of Sargon (Knobel) or Cambyses (Luzzatto), but to a native despot. In comparing the prophecy with the fulfilment, we must bear in mind that <a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a> relates to the national revolution which broke out in Sais, and resulted in the overthrow of the Ethiopian rule, and to the federal dodekarchy to which the rising of the nation led. "Kingdom against kingdom:" this exactly suits those twelve small kingdoms into which Egypt was split up after the overthrow of the Ethiopian dynasty in the year 695, until Psammetichus, the dodekarch of Sais, succeeded in the year 670 in comprehending these twelve states once more under a single monarchy. This very Psammetichus (and the royal house of Psammetichus generally) is the hard ruler, the reckless despot. He succeeded in gaining the battle at Momemphis, by which he established himself in the monarchy, through having first of all strengthened himself with mercenary troops from Ionia, Caria, and Greece. From his time downwards, the true Egyptian character was destroyed by the admixture of foreign elements;<p>(Note: See Leo, Universalgesch. i. 152, and what Brugsch says in his Histoire d'Egypte, i. 250, with regard to the brusques changements that Egypt endured under Psammetichus.)<p>and this occasioned the emigration of a large portion of the military caste to Meroe. The Egyptian nation very soon came to feel how oppressive this new dynasty was, when Necho (616-597), the son and successor of Psammetichus, renewed the project of Ramses-Miamun, to construct a Suez canal, and tore away 120,000 of the natives of the land from their homes, sending them to wear out their lives in forced labour of the most wearisome kind. A revolt on the part of the native troops, who had been sent against the rising Cyrene, and driven back into the desert, led to the overthrow of Hophra, the grandson of Necho (570), and put an end to the hateful government of the family of Psammetichus. </body></html>
