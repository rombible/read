The prayers of the worshippers in spirit and in truth, whether Jews or proselytes, in Egypt should find as immediate an access to the ear of Jehovah as if they had been offered in the Temple at Jerusalem. If the people suffered under the oppression of a Pharaoh, or a Cambyses, or a Ptolemy, and prayed for deliverance, He would as certainly send them a saviour who should free them from the yoke as He had sent saviours to Israel of old in the persons of the judges (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a>; <a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>). It is open to us to see a yet higher fulfilment in the fact that the message of the Gospel brought peace and joy to those who were weary and heavy laden in Egypt, as well as in Galilee; to those who were looking for redemption in Alexandria not less than to those who were looking for it in Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/isaiah/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/19-20.htm" title="And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them....">Isaiah 19:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">And it shall be for a sign </span>— Namely, the altar or pillar, last mentioned; <span class="ital">and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts </span>— To testify that they own the Lord for their God. <span class="ital">For they shall cry unto the Lord because of their oppressors </span>— Being sorely distressed, and finding that their idols are unable to help them, they shall turn unto the true God. <span class="ital">And he shall send them a saviour, and a great one </span>— In these words the prophet sets forth the cause of this happy change in Egypt, with its immediate effects, namely, their crying to the Lord in their distress, and his sending them a saviour, who should deliver them. “Here it is clearly foretold,” says Bishop Newton, “that a <span class="ital">great </span>prince, <span class="ital">sent by God, </span>from a foreign country, should deliver the Egyptians from their Persian oppressors, and <span class="ital">heal </span>their country, which was <span class="ital">smitten of God, </span>and afflicted: and who could this be but Alexander, who is always distinguished by the name of <span class="ital">Alexander the Great, </span>and whose first successor in Egypt was called <span class="ital">the great Ptolemy, </span>and <span class="ital">Ptolemy Soter, </span>or <span class="ital">the saviour? </span>Upon Alexander’s first coming into Egypt the people all cheerfully submitted to him out of hatred to the Persians, so that he became master of the country without any opposition. For this reason he treated them with humanity and kindness, built there a city, which, after his own name, he called Alexandria, appointed one of their own country for their civil governor, and permitted them to be governed by their own laws and customs. By these changes and regulations, and by the prudent and gentle administration of some of the first Ptolemies, Egypt revived, trade and learning flourished, and, for a while, peace and plenty blessed the land. But it is more largely foretold, that, about the same time, the true religion and the worship of the God of Israel should begin to spread and prevail in the land of Egypt; and what event was ever more unlikely to happen than the conversion of a people so sunk and lost in superstition and idolatry, of the worst and grossest kind? It is certain that many of the Jews, after Nebuchadnezzar had taken Jerusalem, fled into Egypt, and carried along with them Jeremiah the prophet, who there uttered many of his prophecies concerning the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar. “From hence,” and by the means above described, “some knowledge of God, and some notice of the prophecies, might easily be derived to the Egyptians.” “By these means, <span class="ital">the Lord </span>must, in some degree, have been <span class="ital">known to Egypt, </span>and the Egyptians must have <span class="ital">known the Lord </span>— And, without doubt, there must have been many proselytes among them. Among those who came up to the feast of pentecost, (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>,) are particularly mentioned <span class="ital">the dwellers in Egypt, and in the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, Jews and proselytes. </span>Nay, from the instance of Candace’s eunuch, (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm" title="And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,">Acts 8:27</a>,) we may infer that there were proselytes even beyond Egypt, in Ethiopia. Thus were the Jews settled and encouraged in Egypt, insomuch that Philo represents their number as not less than a hundred myriads, or ten hundred thousand men.” But though this prophecy concerning Egypt might have its first accomplishment in the deliverance of the Egyptians from the Persian yoke by Alexander the Great, and in that knowledge of the true God, and of his revealed will, which many of the Egyptians received under the government of the Ptolemies, through their intercourse with the Jews, and the translation of the Jewish Scriptures into the Greek language; yet, doubtless, this prediction has a further and higher aspect, as commentators in general have understood it, and refers to that spiritual redemption and salvation which the Egyptians, among many other ignorant and idolatrous Gentiles, were to receive, and actually did receive, by the coming of Christ, the great and only Saviour of lost mankind, and by the publication of his gospel to them. This appears still more evidently from the verses which follow. But the full and final accomplishment of this, as well as of many other important prophecies, shall not take place till Mohammedanism and idolatry shall be completely overthrown, and <span class="ital">the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:18-25 The words, In that day, do not always refer to the passage just before. At a time which was to come, the Egyptians shall speak the holy language, the Scripture language; not only understand it, but use it. Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes the language; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. So many Jews shall come to Egypt, that they shall soon fill five cities. Where the sun was worshipped, a place infamous for idolatry, even there shall be a wonderful reformation. Christ, the great Altar, who sanctifies every gift, shall be owned, and the gospel sacrifices of prayer and praise shall be offered up. Let the broken-hearted and afflicted, whom the Lord has wounded, and thus taught to return to, and call upon him, take courage; for He will heal their souls, and turn their sorrowing supplications into joyful praises. The Gentile nations shall not only unite with each other in the gospel fold under Christ, the great Shepherd, but they shall all be united with the Jews. They shall be owned together by him; they shall all share in one and the same blessing. Meeting at the same throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it shall be for a sign - The altar, and the pillar. This shows that the altar was not to be for sacrifice, but was a "memorial," or designed to designate a place of worship.<p>They shall cry to the Lord because of the oppressors - That is, oppressed and borne down under the exactions of their rulers, they shall seek deliverance from the true God - one instance among many of the effect of affliction and oppression in leading people to embrace the true religion.<p>And he shall send them a saviour - Who this "saviour" would be, has been a subject on which there has been a great difference of opinion. Grotius supposes that it would be "the angel" by which the army of Sennacherib would be destroyed. Gesenius thinks it was Psammetichus, who would deliver them from the tyranny of the eleven kings who were contending with each other, or that, since in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>, he is called a 'severe lord,' it is probable that the promise here is to be understood of a delivering or protecting angel. But it is evident that some person is here denoted who would be sent "subsequently" to the national judgments which are here designated. Dr. Gill supposes that by the saviour here is meant the Messiah; but this interpretation does not suit the connection, for it is evident that the event here predicted, was to take place before the coming of Christ. Vitringa and Dr. Newton suppose with more probability that Alexander the Great is here referred to, who took possession of Egypt after his conquest in the East, and who might be called "a saviour," inasmuch as he delivered them from the reign of the oppressive kings who had tyrannized there, and inasmuch as his reign and the reigns of those who succeeded him in Egypt, would be much more mild than that of the former kings of that country.<p>That Alexander the Great was regarded by the Egyptians as a saviour or deliverer, is apparent from history. Upon his coming to Egypt, the people submitted to him cheerfully, out of hatred to the Persians, so that he became master of the country without any opposition (Diod. Sic. xvii. 49; Arrian, iii. 3, 1; Q. Curtius, iv. 7, 8, as quoted by Newton). He treated them with much kindness; built the city of Alexandria, calling it after his own name, designing to make it the capital of his empire; and under him and the Ptolemies who succeeded him, trade revived, commerce flourished, learning was patronized, and peace and plenty blessed the land. Among other things, Alexander transplanted many Jews into Alexandria, and granted them many privileges, equal to the Macedonians themselves (Jos. "Bell. Jud." ii. 18. 7; "Contra Ap." ii. 4). 'The arrival of Alexander,' says Wilkinson ("Ancient Egyptians," vol. i. pp. 213, 214), 'was greeted with universal satisfaction.<p>Their hatred of the Persians, and their frequent alliances with the Greeks, who had fought under the same banners against a common enemy, naturally taught the Egyptians to welcome the Macedonian army with the strongest demonstrations of friendship, and to consider their coming as a direct interposition of the gods; and so wise and considerate was the conduct of the early Ptolemies, that they almost ceased to regret the period when they were governed by their native princes.' Under the Ptolemies, large numbers of the Jews settled in Egypt. For their use, as has been remarked, the Old Testament was translated into Greek, and a temple was built by Onias, under the sixth Ptolemy. Philo represents the number of the Jews in Egypt in his time at not less than one million. They were settled in nearly all parts oF Egypt; but particularly in Heliopolis or the city of the sun, in Migdol, in Tahpanes, in Noph or Memphis, in Pathros or Thebais <a href="/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a> - perhaps the five cities referred to in <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>.<p>And a great one - (&#1493;&#1512;&#1489;  va&#770;ra&#770;b). A mighty one; a powerful saviour. The name 'great' has been commonly assigned to Alexander. The Septuagint renders this, 'Judging (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  krino&#772;n), he shall save them;' evidently regarding &#1512;&#1489;  ra&#770;b as derived from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;  riyb "to manage a cause, or to judge."

At Alexandria, called from him, the Old Testament was translated into Greek for the Greek-speaking Jews, who in large numbers dwelt in Egypt under the Ptolemies, his successors.

This refers either to what goes before, that the altar and pillar were signs and witnesses that the Lord was believed in, professed, and worshipped there; or to what follows after, that the Lord's hearing the cries of men, and answering them, by sending a great Saviour to them, is a token and testimony for him of his great love unto them: <p>for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors; as men awakened and convinced do, feeling the oppressions of a guilty conscience, and a tempting devil, and an ensnaring wicked world: <p>and he shall send them a Saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them; this is Christ, whom God sent in the fulness of time to be the Saviour of lost sinners; and he is a "great" one indeed, the great God, and our Saviour, <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a> who is the Son of God, the true God, and eternal life, who has all the perfections of deity in him; the Creator and Upholder of all things; and must have therefore great and sufficient abilities to save sinners to the uttermost; and those that come to God by him he does save and deliver from all their sins, and out of the hands of all their enemies, and from wrath, ruin, and destruction. Abarbinel (e) owns that the Messiah is here meant, as undoubtedly he is; and not the angel that destroyed Sennacherib's army, as Kimchi; for the text speaks not of the Jews, but of the Egyptians. Vitringa thinks that either Alexander, called the Great, or else Ptolemy the son of Lagus, who had the same epithet, and who was also called "Soter", the saviour, is here meant. <p>(e) Mashmiah Jeshua, fol. 13. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.</span><p>(u) This declares that this prophecy would be accomplished in the time of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts</span>] i.e. a reminder that He has a people in Egypt, and that by their presence the land is consecrated to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The process of conversion in this and the following verses is finely conceived. First, the name of Jehovah is made known by the religious observances of the Jewish colonists and proselytes; then, in a time of trouble, the Egyptians turn to Him instead of to their false gods, and learn to know Him through His answer to their prayers (20, 21); finally this experience of Jehovah is deepened and purified by a discipline similar to that to which Israel was subjected in the time of the Judges (22).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the oppressors</span>] Omit the art.; the reference is quite general.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a saviour</span>] See <a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Jdg 3:9</a>; <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Jdg 3:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-5.htm" title="(And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelled in their tents, as beforetime.">2 Kings 13:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a great one</span>] Better: <span class="bld">a champion</span>.

And there does not occur of Egypt any work, which worked, of head and tail, palm-branch and rush." The spirit which God pours out (as it also said elsewhere) is not only a spirit of salvation, but also a spirit of judgment. The judicial, penal result which He produces is here called &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, which is formed from &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1493; (root &#1506;&#1493;, to curve), and is either contracted from &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, or points back to a supposed singular &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 158, b). The suffix in b'kriba&#770;h points to Egypt. The divine spirit of judgment makes use of the imaginary wisdom of the priestly caste, and thereby plunges the people, as it were, into the giddiness of intoxication. The prophet employs the hiphil &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; to denote the carefully considered actions of the leaders of the nation, and the niphal &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; to denote the constrained actions of a drunken man, who has lost all self-control. The nation has been so perverted by false counsels and hopes, that it lies there like a drunken man in his own vomit, and gropes and rolls about, without being able to find any way of escape. "No work that worked," i.e., that averted trouble (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is as emphatic as in <a href="/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>), was successfully carried out by any one, either by the leaders of the nation or by the common people and their flatterers, either by the upper classes or by the mob. </body></html>
