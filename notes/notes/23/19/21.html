The highest of all blessings, the knowledge of God as He is (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), was not to be the exclusive inheritance of Israel, but was to be shared even by the nation whom she had reason to regard as her hereditary enemy.<p><span class= "bld">Sacrifice and oblation.</span>—The two words describe respectively the slain victims and the meat, or rather, <span class= "ital">meal, </span>offerings of the Law. Did the prophet, we ask, think of such sacrifices as literally offered in Egypt, or did he look beyond the symbol to the thing symbolised? The builders of the temple at Leontopolis took the former view. Those who have entered into the mind and spirit of Isaiah will be inclined, perhaps, to take the latter. A literal fulfilment has been found in the fact that Ptolemy Euergetes (B.C. 244) came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:18-25 The words, In that day, do not always refer to the passage just before. At a time which was to come, the Egyptians shall speak the holy language, the Scripture language; not only understand it, but use it. Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes the language; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. So many Jews shall come to Egypt, that they shall soon fill five cities. Where the sun was worshipped, a place infamous for idolatry, even there shall be a wonderful reformation. Christ, the great Altar, who sanctifies every gift, shall be owned, and the gospel sacrifices of prayer and praise shall be offered up. Let the broken-hearted and afflicted, whom the Lord has wounded, and thus taught to return to, and call upon him, take courage; for He will heal their souls, and turn their sorrowing supplications into joyful praises. The Gentile nations shall not only unite with each other in the gospel fold under Christ, the great Shepherd, but they shall all be united with the Jews. They shall be owned together by him; they shall all share in one and the same blessing. Meeting at the same throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord shall be known to Egypt - Shall be worshipped and honored by the Jews who shall dwell there, and by those who shall be proselyted to their religion.<p>And the Egyptians shall know the Lord - That many of the Egyptians would be converted to the Jewish religion there can be no doubt.

The means of knowing him would be granted them; which were partly through the Bible being translated into the Greek language, at the request of Ptolemy king of Egypt, which was then understood in that country, and this was a considerable time before the coming of Christ; and chiefly through the Gospel being brought hither by the Evangelist Mark, and others, whereby many of them were brought to a spiritual, experimental, and evangelical knowledge of Christ: <p>and the Egyptians shall know the Lord; own and acknowledge him, profess faith in him, hope of happiness by him, love of him, and subjection to him, his Gospel and ordinances: <p>and shall do sacrifice and oblation; not such sacrifice and oblation as were enjoined by the ceremonial law, since those would be now abrogated; but the spiritual sacrifices of prayer, praise, and good works, and of the presentation of themselves, as a holy, living, and acceptable sacrifice to God, their reasonable service: under these ceremonial rites is signified the whole spiritual worship of the New Testament: <p>yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it; lay themselves under obligation to serve the Lord, and act according to it; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a> and this is to be understood not of legal vows, as that of the Nazarite, or any other, but of the spiritual one of praise and thanksgiving; see <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow to the LORD, and perform <i>it</i>.</span><p>(x) By these ceremonies he comprehends the spiritual service under Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">shall be known</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">shall make himself known</span>, as R.V. marg.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sacrifice and oblation</span>] animal and vegetable offerings, see on <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall be known</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall make himself known</span>, as in <a href="/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5, 9</a>; by answering prayer, by spiritual influences, and the like. <span class="cmt_word">The Egyptians shall know the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, "They shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall do sacrifice and oblation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall serve with sacrifice and oblation</span>. The bulk of the Jews settled in Egypt, together with their Egyptian proselytes, went up year by year to worship Jehovah at Jerusalem, and make offerings to him there (see <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>). Christian Egypt worshipped God with sacrifice and oblation in the same sense as the rest of the Church (<a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/isaiah/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> this state of confusion is more minutely described: "Jehovah hath poured a spirit of giddiness into the heart of Egypt, so that they have led Egypt astray in all its doing, as a drunken man wandereth about in his vomit. And there does not occur of Egypt any work, which worked, of head and tail, palm-branch and rush." The spirit which God pours out (as it also said elsewhere) is not only a spirit of salvation, but also a spirit of judgment. The judicial, penal result which He produces is here called &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, which is formed from &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1493; (root &#1506;&#1493;, to curve), and is either contracted from &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, or points back to a supposed singular &#1506;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 158, b). The suffix in b'kriba&#770;h points to Egypt. The divine spirit of judgment makes use of the imaginary wisdom of the priestly caste, and thereby plunges the people, as it were, into the giddiness of intoxication. The prophet employs the hiphil &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; to denote the carefully considered actions of the leaders of the nation, and the niphal &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; to denote the constrained actions of a drunken man, who has lost all self-control. The nation has been so perverted by false counsels and hopes, that it lies there like a drunken man in his own vomit, and gropes and rolls about, without being able to find any way of escape. "No work that worked," i.e., that averted trouble (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is as emphatic as in <a href="/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>), was successfully carried out by any one, either by the leaders of the nation or by the common people and their flatterers, either by the upper classes or by the mob. </body></html>
