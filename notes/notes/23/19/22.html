The prophet, however, is no eater of his words. What he has learnt is to look beyond the chastisement, and to see that it is as true of Egypt as of Israel, that “whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth.” The sword of Jehovah smote but to heal, and the healing could not come without the smiting. Through it they would be led to pray, and prayer was the condition of all spiritual recovery.<span class= "bld"><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:18-25 The words, In that day, do not always refer to the passage just before. At a time which was to come, the Egyptians shall speak the holy language, the Scripture language; not only understand it, but use it. Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes the language; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. So many Jews shall come to Egypt, that they shall soon fill five cities. Where the sun was worshipped, a place infamous for idolatry, even there shall be a wonderful reformation. Christ, the great Altar, who sanctifies every gift, shall be owned, and the gospel sacrifices of prayer and praise shall be offered up. Let the broken-hearted and afflicted, whom the Lord has wounded, and thus taught to return to, and call upon him, take courage; for He will heal their souls, and turn their sorrowing supplications into joyful praises. The Gentile nations shall not only unite with each other in the gospel fold under Christ, the great Shepherd, but they shall all be united with the Jews. They shall be owned together by him; they shall all share in one and the same blessing. Meeting at the same throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord shall smite Egypt - That is, in the manner described in the previous part of this prophecy <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2-10</a>.<p>And heal it - Or restore it to more than its former splendor and prosperity, as described in the previous verses <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-20</a>.

"In that day will the Egyptians become like women, and tremble and be alarmed at the swinging of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which He sets in motion against it. And the land of Judah becomes a shuddering for Egypt; as often as they mention this against Egypt, it is alarmed, because of the decree of Jehovah of hosts, that He suspendeth over it." The swinging (tenupha&#770;h) of the hand (<a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a>) points back to the foregoing judgments, which have fallen upon Egypt blow after blow. These humiliations make the Egyptians as soft and timid as women (tert. compar., not as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>).
