Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and countenance those who do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/3_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church - It would seem that they had returned to John, and borne honorable testimony to the love manifested to them by Gaius.

"Whom bringing forward, or having brought forward." The word refers to aid rendered to them in their journey, in facilitating their travels, either by personally accompanying them, by furnishing them the means of prosecuting their journey, or by hospitably entertaining them. Gaius probably aided them in every way in which it was practicable. It has been made a question whether this refer, to the fact that he had thus aided them in some visit which they had made to the church where Gaius was, or to a visit which they purposed to make. The Greek would seem to favor the latter construction, and yet it would appear from the Epistle, that the "brethren and strangers" actually had been with him that they had been rejected by the church through the influence of Diotrephes, and had been thrown upon the hospitality of Gaius, and that they had returned, and had borne honorable testimony to his hospitality. These views can be reconciled by supposing, as Lucke does, that having been once on their travels, and having shared the hospitality of Gaius, they were purposing to visit that region again, and that John, praising him for his former hospitality, commends them again to him, stating the reason <a href="//biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9-10</a> why he did not, in accordance with the usual custom, recommend them to the care of the church.

At Ephesus, where John was; these brethren and strangers coming thither, and being greatly affected with Gaius's kindness and liberality to them, could not forbear speaking of it to his praise, in the presence of the members of the church, as well as acquainted the Apostle John with it; the Syriac version reads, "before the whole church"; they bore testimony of his liberality in a very public manner And this the apostle mentions to encourage Gaius to go on, and continue in his kindness to the same persons, since they retained such a grateful sense of past favours; and whereas they were now returning back, he desires that he would give them some further assistance: <p>whom if thou bring forward on their journey; the word here used signifies, to send on before, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>, and is used by the Septuagint in the same sense as here, and in the above places, in <a href="/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>; where it is said, that "Abraham went with them (the angels) to bring them on in the way",  "to send them on", or "send them away"; dismiss them, take his leave of them in a friendly and honourable way. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan render it,  "to accompany them"; and so this Greek word, which seems to answer to the Hebrew phrase, signifies an honourable accompanying, leading forth, and taking leave of friends; and so the apostle encourages Gaius to behave in like manner to the brethren and strangers; meaning, either by accompanying them in person, or by sending his servants along with them, both to direct them the way, and to secure them from danger, and chiefly by furnishing them with everything necessary for them; see <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>. And this he would have him do, <p>after a godly sort; or "worthy of God"; in imitation of God, who is merciful, kind, and beneficent; or as it became him whom God had called by his grace to his kingdom and glory; or as it was fit and proper such servants of God, as those brethren were, should be used; and this would be doing well: <p>thou shalt do well; what is grateful and well pleasing to God, and beautiful and lovely in the eyes of his people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/3_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</span><p>(c) He commends to Gaius, either those same men whom he had entertained before returning to him, about the affairs of the Church, or else some other who had similar business.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/3_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/3_john/1-6.htm" title="Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:">3 John 1:6</a>.
