Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and countenance those who do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/3_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came - Who these were is not certainly known. They may have been members of the same church with Gaius, who, for some reason, had visited the writer of this Epistle; or they may have been the "brethren" who had gone from him with a letter of commendation to the church, <a href="//biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9</a>, and had been rejected by the church through the influence of Diotrephes, and who, after having been hospitably entertained by Gaius, had again returned to the writer of this Epistle. In that case, they would of course bear honorable testimony to the kindness which they had received from Gaius, and to his Christian character.<p>And testified of the truth that is in thee - That you adhere steadfastly to the truth, notwithstanding the fact that errors abound, and that there are many false teachers in the world.<p>Even as thou walkest in the truth - Livest in accordance with the truth.

The sentence is not “a direct sentence” (Baumgarten-Crusius: “as thou indeed art living in accordance with the truth”) by which “John adds his testimony to that of the brethren (Besser) in order to confirm it” (Ebrard), but “an indirect sentence” (Brückner) dependent on <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρούντων</span>, on which a special emphasis is laid, as also the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούω</span> in <a href="/3_john/1-4.htm" title="I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.">3 John 1:4</a> shows (so also Düsterdieck, Braune). <span class="greekheb">σύ</span> is emphatically used in contrast to those who do not walk <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/3_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3 John 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐχάρην</span>, see note on <a href="/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2 John 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐρχομένων</span>, repeatedly, not on one particular occasion (<span class="greekheb">ἐλθόντων</span>).
