Philip and Bartholomew&#8212;That this person is the same with "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee" is justly concluded for the three following reasons: First, because Bartholomew is not so properly an individual's name as a family surname; next, because not only in this list, but in Mark's and Luke's (Mr 3:18; Lu 6:14), he follows the name of "Philip," who was the instrument of bringing Nathanael first to Jesus (Joh 1:45); and again, when our Lord, after His resurrection, appeared at the Sea of Tiberias, "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee" is mentioned along with six others, all of them apostles, as being present (Joh 21:2).<p>Matthew the publican&#8212;In none of the four lists of the Twelve is this apostle so branded but in his own, as if he would have all to know how deep a debtor he had been to his Lord. (See on [1253]Mt 1:3, 5, 6; [1254]9:9).<p>James the son of Alphaeus&#8212;the same person apparently who is called Cleopas or Clopas (Lu 24:18; Joh 19:25); and, as he was the husband of Mary, sister to the Virgin, James the Less must have been our Lord's cousin.<p>and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus&#8212;the same, without doubt, as "Judas the brother of James," mentioned in both the lists of Luke (Lu 6:16; Ac 1:13), while no one of the name of Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus is so. It is he who in John (Joh 14:22) is sweetly called "Judas, not Iscariot." That he was the author of the Catholic Epistle of "Jude," and not "the Lord's brother" (Mt 13:55), unless these be the same, is most likely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Philip and Bartholomew,.... The first of these was called next; his name is a Greek one, which his parents, though Jews, might take from the Greeks that dwelt among them, see <a href="/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20</a> mention is made of one R. Phelipi, and Phulipa, in the Jewish writings (q). The latter of these, Bartholomew, is conjectured, by Dr. Lightfoot, to be the same with Nathanael, he being called next in order after Philip; and that his name was Nathanael, , "Bar Talmai", or "the son of Talmai", or "Ptolomy": a name once common to the kings of Egypt: so Talmai, king of Geshur, is by the Septuagint, in <a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a> <a href="/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a> called Tholmi, and in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a> Tholmai: hence it appears, that Bartholomew is no other than Bartholmi, or the son of Tholmi. We read of one R. Jonathan, , "ben Abtolemus", in the Talmud (r), whether the same name with this, may be considered. <p>Thomas, and Matthew the publican: by the other evangelists Matthew is mentioned first; but he being the writer of this Gospel, puts Thomas first, which is an instance of his modesty; and also calls himself the "publican", which the other do not: this he mentions, to magnify the grace of God in his vocation. The Jews (s) speak of   "Matthai", or "Matthew", as a disciple of Jesus. Thomas was sometimes called Didymus; the one was his Hebrew, the other his Greek name, and both signify a "twin", as it is very likely he was: mention is made of R. Thoma, or Thomas bar Papias, in a Jewish writer (t). Next follow, <p>James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus: the former of these is so called, to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. This is the James, who was the brother of our Lord, <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a> and is called "James the less", <a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>. Alphaeus his father, is the same with Cleopas, <a href="/luke/24-18.htm">Luke 24:18</a> or Cleophas,  <a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. The Hebrew name,  which often occurs among the Jews (u), may be pronounced either Chlophi, or Alphi, or with the Greek termination Cleopas, or Alphaeus. The latter of this pair of apostles is the same person with Jude, the writer of the epistle, which bears that name, and was the brother of James, with whom he is coupled: he was called Lebbaeus, either from the town of Lebba, a sea coast town of Galilee, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks; or from the Hebrew word  "my heart", as others, either for his prudence, or through the affections of his parents to him; as the Latins call one they love, "meum corculum", "my little heart"; or from  "a lion", that being the motto of the tribe of Judah. His surname Thaddaeus, is thought by some to be a deflexion of Jude; or Judas, and as coming from the same root,  which signifies "to praise", or "give thanks"; or from the Syriac word,  "a breast", and may be so called for the same reason as he was Lebbaeus. Frequent mention is made of this name,  "Thaddai", or "Thaddaeus", among the Talmudic (w) doctors. The Jews themselves speak (x) of one  "Thodah", as a disciple of Jesus, by whom no doubt they mean this same disciple. Eusebius (y) mentions one Thaddaeus, as one of the seventy disciples, who was sent to Agbarus, king of Edessa, who was healed and converted by him. This Agbarus is reported to have wrote a letter to Jesus Christ, desiring him to come and cure him of his disease; to which Christ is said to return an answer, promising to send one of his disciples, who should do it; and that accordingly, after Christ's death, Thomas sent this Thaddaeus to him. <p>(q) Massechet Sopherim, c. 21. sect. 7.

The view that this Judas is a <span class="ital">different</span> person from Lebbaeus, and that he had succeeded to the place rendered vacant, probably by the death of Lebbaeus (Schleiermacher, Ewald), cannot possibly be entertained, for this reason, that in that case the statement in <a href="/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἐκλεξάμενος</span>, etc.) would be simply incorrect, which is not to be supposed in connection with a matter so important and generally known (Rufinus, <span class="ital">in Praef. ad Origen in ep. ad Rom</span>.).

As a mere child, he was considered a prodigy of learning; and he sustained this reputation at the Sorbonne, where he took the degree of Batchelor. In 1667 the great Minister Colbert selected him, together with the celebrated Du Cange, to examine and catalogue the Greek MSS. of the Royal Library. The able manner in which he performed this task procured him, in 1676, the Professorship of Greek in the Royal College at Paris. His labours were many and valuable. He died in 1686.—(I.

It seems hard to account for the introduction of such a reading, if not genuine: and yet the weight of authorities are for <span class="greekheb">Καὶ Θαδδαῖος</span> here, which otherwise might well be a transcriber’s or harmonist’s correction from <a href="/mark/3-18.htm" title="And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,">Mark 3:18</a>; <span class="greekheb">Δεββαῖος</span>, as the less open to suspicion of transcribers’ corrections, being accounted as the genuine reading. Jerome calls him <span class="greekheb">τριώνυμος</span>, <span class="ital">triple-named</span>; so that in his day Lebbeus must have been a recognised name either here or in Mark, as well as Thaddeus and Judas.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then follow immediately the words referred to by Bengel: <span class="greekheb">Ἰάκωβος Ἀλφαίον</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ καὶ Θκδδαῖος καὶ Λευὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τῷ Μαρκῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">παρὰ δὲ τῷ Ματθαιῷ Δεββαιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">παρὰ δὲ Δουκᾷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the note on Hesychius (Ed.

Michaelis, in his Einleitung, T. ii., p. m. 1687, etc., shows, by many proofs, that Judas the brother of James is the same as Thaddeus and Lebbeus, and was called among the Syrians Adai or Adæus.—E.

Friedmann; cf. also Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), superseded the proper name. <span class="cmt_word">Thomas</span>. "As Thomas (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), ' the Twin,' is properly a surname, and this apostle must have had some other name, there seems no reason for doubting this very early tradition [Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:13, and probably the Old Syriac of <a href="/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>] that he also was a Jude" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 257, edit. 1869).

If the word "Thaddaeus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>) was as seems likely (for Edersheim's connexion of it with <span class="accented">todah</span>, "praise," is based on what is apparently a mere play of words in Talm. Bob., 'Sanh.,' 43a), originally a pet-name (<span class="accented">Sehosskind</span>, "Bosom-child," Weiss, Nosgen) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "the female breasts," it is intelligible that he or others would prefer the somewhat synonymous "Lebbseus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, "heart"), which might mean "child of one's heart," but more probably "courageous," found in the "Western" text. The similarity of sound would help towards this, even if another derivation that seems possible, "the Fiery" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "kindle"), be the true one. In the latter case the appellation, "Jude the Zealot" (Old Latin), may rest on something more than a mistaken interpretation of the parallel passage in Luke. In Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' it is said that "this name [Lebbaeus] is apparently due to an early attempt to bring Levi (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) the publican (<a href="/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27</a>) within the Twelve, it being assumed that his call was to apostleship just as in <a href="/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is changed in Western texts to <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> follows, and it was assumed that the son of Halphseus elsewhere named as one of the Twelve must be meant.
