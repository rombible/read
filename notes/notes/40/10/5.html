for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>). We must remember, however, (1) that the limitation was confined to the mission on which they were now sent; (2) that it did but recognise a divine order, the priority of Israel in God’s dealing with mankind, “to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;” and (3) that the disciples themselves were as yet unfitted to enter on a work which required wider thoughts and hopes than they had yet attained. It was necessary that they should learn to share their Master’s pity for the lost sheep of the house of Israel before they could enter into His yearnings after the sheep that were “not of this fold” (<a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:...">Matthew 10:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">These twelve Jesus sent forth — </span>Namely, to preach the gospel and to work miracles; exercising therein his supreme authority over his Church. <span class="ital">And commanded, Go not into the way of the Gentiles </span>— That is, into their country.

This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into the way of the Gentiles - That is, among the Gentiles, or nowhere but among the Jews. The full time for preaching the gospel to the Gentiles was not come. It was proper that it should be first preached to the Jews, the ancient covenant people of God, and the people among whom the Messiah was born. Afterward he gave them a charge to go into all the world, <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>.<p>And into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not - The Samaritans occupied the country formerly belonging to the tribe of Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This region was situated between Jerusalem and Galilee; so that in passing from the one to the other, it was a direct course to pass through Samaria. The capital of the country was Samaria, formerly a large and splendid city. It was situated about 15 miles to the northwest of the city of Shechem or Sychar (see the notes at <a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), and about 40 miles to the north of Jerusalem. For a description of this city, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>. Sychar or Shechem was also a city within the limits of Samaria.<p>This people was formerly composed of a few of the ten tribes and a mixture of foreigners. When the ten tribes were carried away into captivity to Babylon, the King of Assyria sent people from Cutha, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim to inhabit their country, <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2-11</a>. These people at first worshipped the idols of their own nations; but, being troubled with lions, which had increased greatly while the country remained uninhabited, they supposed it was because they had not honored the God of the country. A Jewish priest was therefore sent to them from Babylon to instruct them in the Jewish religion. They were instructed partially from the books of Moses, but still retained many of their old rites and idolatrous customs, and embraced a religion made up of Judaism and idolatry, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26-28</a>.<p>The grounds of difference between the two nations were the following:<p>1. The Jews, after their return from Babylon, set about rebuilding their temple. The Samaritans offered to aid them. The Jews, however, perceiving that it was not from a love of true religion, but that they might obtain a part of the favors granted to the Jews by Cyrus, rejected their offer. The consequence was, that a stare of long and bitter animosity arose between them and the Jews.<p>2. While Nehemiah was engaged in building the walls of Jerusalem, the Samaritans used every art to thwart him in his undertaking, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1-14</a>.<p>3. The Samaritans at length obtained leave of the Persian monarch to build a temple for themselves. This was erected on "Mount Gerizim," and they strenuously contended that that was the place designated by Moses as the place where the nation should worship. Sanballat, the leader of the Samaritans, constituted his son-in-law, Manasses, high priest. The religion of the Samaritans thus became perpetuated, and an irreconcilable hatred arose between them and the Jews. See the notes at <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>.<p>4. Afterward Samaria became a place of resort for all the outlaws of Judea. They received willingly all the Jewish criminals and refugees from justice. The violators of the Jewish laws, and those who had been excommunicated, betook themselves for safety to Samaria, and greatly increased their numbers and the hatred which subsisted between the two nations.<p>5. The Samaritans received only the five books of Moses, and rejected the writings of the prophets and all the Jewish traditions. From these causes arose an irreconcilable difference between them, so that the Jews regarded them as the worst of the human race <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48</a>, and had no dealings with them, <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>.<p>Our Saviour, however, preached the gospel to them afterward <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6-26</a>, and the apostles imitated his example, <a href="/acts/8-25.htm">Acts 8:25</a>. The gospel was, however, first preached to the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 10:5-42. The Twelve Receive Their Instructions.<p>This directory divides itself into three distinct parts. The first part (Mt 10:5-15) contains directions for the brief and temporary mission on which they were now going forth, with respect to the places they were to go to, the works they were to do, the message they were to bear, and the manner in which they were to conduct themselves. The second part (Mt 10:16-23) contains directions of no such limited and temporary nature, but opens out into the permanent exercise of the Gospel ministry. The third part (Mt 10:24-42) is of wider application still, reaching not only to the ministry of the Gospel in every age, but to the service of Christ in the widest sense. It is a strong confirmation of this threefold division, that each part closes with the words, "Verily I SAY UNTO YOU" (Mt 10:15, 23, 42).<p>Directions for the Present Mission (Mt 10:5-15).<p>5. These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not&#8212;The Samaritans were Gentiles by blood; but being the descendants of those whom the king of Assyria had transported from the East to supply the place of the ten tribes carried captive, they had adopted the religion of the Jews, though with admixtures of their own: and, as the nearest neighbors of the Jews, they occupied a place intermediate between them and the Gentiles. Accordingly, when this prohibition was to be taken off, on the effusion of the Spirit at Pentecost, the apostles were told that they should be Christ's witnesses first "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea," then "in Samaria," and lastly, "unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Ac 1:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/10-6.htm" title="But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 10:6</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These twelve Jesus sent forth,.... And no other but them, under the character of apostles. These had been with him a considerable time, to whom he had been gradually communicating spiritual knowledge; and by the benefit of private conference with him, and the observation they had made upon his doctrine and conduct, were greatly qualified for public usefulness: wherefore he gives them a commission, furnishes them with power and authority; and sends them forth from him by pairs, that they might be assisting to one another, and bear a joint testimony to the Gospel they preached; but before he sent them forth from his presence, he gave them some directions where they should go, and to whom they should minister, and where not: <p>and he commanded them, as their Lord and Master; he gave them strict orders, which he expected them to comply with, and closely enjoined them, as they must answer it to him again, <p>saying, go not into the way of the Gentiles; meaning, not the customs' and manners of the Heathens, they were to avoid; but that they were not to steer their course, or take their journey towards them: they were not, as yet, to go among them, and preach the Gospel to them; the calling of the Gentiles was not a matter, as yet, so clearly revealed and known, nor was the time of their calling come: besides it was the will of God, that the Gospel should be first preached to the Jews, to take off all excuse from them, and that their obstinacy and perverseness in rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, might manifestly appear; and since Christ himself was the minister of the circumcision, he would have his apostles, for the present, whilst he was on earth, act agreeably to the character he bore, that there might be an entire harmony in their conduct. <p>And into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: the word "any" is supplied, and that very rightly; for, not the city of Samaria, the metropolis of that country, as the Arabic version reads it, is only meant, but any, and every city of the Samaritans: not that it was strictly unlawful and criminal to go thither; for he himself went into one of their cities, and so did his apostles, <a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4</a> <a href="/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52</a> and after his death preached the Gospel there; but he judged it not proper and expedient at this time, and as yet, to do it; that is, not before their preaching it to the Jews; for there was a very great hatred subsisting between the Jews, and the Samaritans, insomuch that they had no conversation with each other in things civil or religious. The Samaritans, though they boasted of their descent from Jacob, were a mongrel sort of people, partly Jews, and partly Gentiles, a mixture of both; and therefore are distinguished from both and though they had, and held the law, and five books of Moses, yet corrupted them in many places, to serve their purpose, and countenance their religion, particularly their worshipping at Mount Gerizim; on which account they were looked upon by the Jews as apostates, idolaters, and even as Heathens (f), and are therefore here joined with them; and to shun giving offence to the Jews, seems to be the reason of this prohibition; see Gill on <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>. <p>(f) T.

As in the case of the Sermon on the Mount, so on this occasion also, Luke’s parallels are irregular in their connection (in ch. 9 connected with the mission of the Twelve, in ch. 10 with the mission of the Seventy). But this is only an additional reason (in answer to Sieffart, Holtzmann) why the preference as respects essential originality—a preference, however, which in no way excludes the idea of the proleptical interweaving of a few later pieces—should also in this instance be given to Matthew, inasmuch as the contents of the passage now before us are undoubtedly taken from his collection of our Lord’s sayings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">mission itself</span>, to which <a href="/luke/20-35.htm" title="But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:">Luke 20:35</a> points back, and which for this very reason we should be the less inclined to regard as having taken place <span class="ital">repeatedly</span> (Weisse, Ewald), was intended as a preliminary experiment in the independent exercise of their calling.

For this reason the Samaritans tried to prevent the rebuilding of the temple by bringing accusations against them before Cyrus. Upon this and upon disputed questions of a doctrinal and liturgical nature, the hatred referred to was founded. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-25.htm" title="The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.">Sir 1:25</a> ff.; Lightfoot, p. 327 f.

Their religion was a corrupt form of Judaism. For being plagued with lions, the Samaritans summoned a priest to instruct them in the religion of the Jews. Soon, however, they lapsed from a pure worship, and in consequence of their hatred to the Jews, purposely introduced certain innovations. Their rival temple on Mount Gerizim was destroyed by John Hyrcanus about 129 b. c. See Nutt’s “<span class="ital">Sketch of the Samaritans</span>,” p. 19.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>About twenty years previous to our Lord’s ministry the Samaritans had intensified the national antipathy by a gross act of profanation.

The subdivisions of the first part are: (1) Their mission field, 5, 6. (2) Their words and works, 7, 8. (3) Their equipment, 9, 10. (4) Their approach to cities and houses, 11–15.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:...">Matthew 10:5-6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁδὸν</span>—<span class="greekheb">πόλιν</span>—<span class="greekheb">οἴκον</span>, <span class="ital">way—city—house</span>) The apostles were sometimes obliged to tread the roads of the Samaritans in their journeys;[454] but there was the less need for them to enter their cities, and stay there, because the Lord had preached to them in His journey (see John 4), and the apostles also were afterwards to come to them. The first of these injunctions regards this first legation; most of the rest apply equally to the whole office of the apostolate, to which the twelve are introduced on the present occasion; cf. <a href="/matthew/10-18.htm" title="And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.">Matthew 10:18</a>.

Note). Bengel suggests (on ver. 1) that the twelve were not all absent at once, but were sent out in relays; but <a href="/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30</a> is against this opinion (cf. also <a href="/luke/22-35.htm">Luke 22:35</a>).

Bishop Lightfoot's classical note in 'Galatians' (pp. 92-101, edit. 1869). <span class="cmt_word">And commanded them, saying</span>; <span class="accented">charged them</span> (Revised Version). Important as the charge is, its necessary subordination to the fact that they were sent is expressed by the very form of the sentence (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>...

The connexion and development of thought in this important charge is exceedingly difficult to perceive, and has been understood in many ways. Perhaps that most generally accepted in this country is Alford's, according to which the charge is divided into three sections - the first (vers. 5-15) referring to the mission to the cities of Israel; the second (vers. 16-23) to the general mission of the apostles as developing itself, after the Lord should be taken from them, in preaching to Jews and Gentiles, ending with the close of the apostolic period in the narrower sense (ver. 23 referring primarily to the destruction of Jerusalem); the third (vers. 24-42) spoken directly of all the disciples of the Lord, concluding with the last great reward. But this threefold historical arrangement seems to be little more than fanciful, the basis of truth Underlying it probably being that the charge in its present form is due to the writer of the Gospel (nor to our Lord directly), who desired not only to record what our Lord said at the time of this mission, but also to incorporate other sayings of his that bore upon similar work, and thus to give such a summary of our Lord's utterances as would be of special use to preachers of the gospel, irrespective of place or time. Observe that ch. 5. - vii, referred to believers in their private capacity - laying stress on the relation that they were to hold to the religion of the day - while this chapter refers to them as representing Christ to the world. The original basis of the commission was addressed to men called to give their whole time to this work, but as the chapter stands it applies to all believers in their  capacity of witnesses for Christ. The ministerial function of preaching committed to men selected for it is only an accentuation of one of the duties expected from all Christ's followers. The development of thought in the chapter appears to be as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The external conditions of conveying Christ's message, with special reference to the immediate occasion (vers. 5<span class="accented">b</span> - 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The internal conditions (vers. 16-39). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 16-23: Though surrounded by enemies, you must conduct yourselves with calmness (ver. 19); with endurance (ver. 22); with wisdom (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 24-33: Remembering that fellowship with me in suffering is essential to fellowship with me in glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Vers. 34-39: Such fellowship with me will cost separation from the dearest on earth, yet its reward is great. 3.

The sphere of their work. The reasons for the limitation here expressly enforced are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it was only right that the proclamation of the coming of Messiah should be thoroughly made to the Jews first. Had they accepted it, they would have become the great factors in the evangelization of the Gentiles (cf. <a href="/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12, 15</a>); as they rejected it, it was necessary that the offer should, apart from them, be made to others (<a href="/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The apostles were as yet in no fit state spiritually to carry the message beyond their own nation, and the facts which they were in a position to proclaim might, when proclaimed alone, have proved a stumbling-block to the after-acceptance by Gentiles and Samaritaus of a fuller and therefore truer message (cf. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Therefore they are now bid perform their present duty without turning away from it, and, as we may add, will-out anticipating their entrance upon a wider sphere. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Go not</span>. This would be outside your course (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). In the Greek, however, the following words receive the <span class="accented">emphasis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Into the</span> (<span class="accented">any</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">way of the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> These words are generally understood to mean "into any road that would lead to Gentile lands or districts." So Tyndale, "Go not into the wayes that leade to the gentyls." (For this genitive of direction, cf. <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and perhaps, Judith 5:14.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.,' takes them as equivalent to "into any street in a heathen land," making the genitives, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, both possessive. There are serious objections to these two interpretations; to the first, that the genitives are then used in different senses; to the second, that it suggests something altogether outside the Israelitish border. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Is not a third interpretation possible - to consider flint our Lord had in his mind the parts of towns, otherwise Jewish, which were inhabited by heathen, just as, in the days of Omri and Ahab, such parts were assigned to Syrians in Samaria, and to Israelites in Damascus, or in modern times to Jews in Christian towns? We have not, indeed, direct evidence of Gentiles, during the time of our Lord, thus living in separate streets, but with the Jewish aversion to even letting them houses and to having more to do with them than possible (cf. Schurer, II. 1:51-56), it would seem probable that, without any formal arrangement being made, the result would be separation of this kind. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is not used elsewhere in this sense in the New Testament, but a comparison of passages in the LXX. seems to justify our so interpreting it.

Compare especially <a href="/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>, "in the streets of Ascalon," where, for the common text, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Lucian's reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The expression thus means - Go not off into any quarter (of such towns as you may come across) inhabited by Gentiles, and (both in complete parallelism and with perfect accuracy, for Samaritans dwelt alone) into any city of Samaritans enter ye not. <span class="cmt_word">And into any city</span>.

A slight turning away would sometimes bring them to Gentile quarters; but into a Samaritan town they would have definitely and purposely to enter. Observe that our Lord himself so far extended his own practice as not to refuse to take the opportunity of preaching to a Samaritan woman when it presented itself, and further followed up the work thus begun by continuing two days in her village (<a href="/john/4-40.htm">John 4:40</a>).
