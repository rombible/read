The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2-4</a>, <a href="/context/mark/3-16.htm" title="And Simon he surnamed Peter;">Mark 3:16-19</a>, <a href="/context/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13-16</a>, <a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>) brings out some interesting facts. (1.) The name of Peter is always first, that of Judas always last. In the former case we recognise acknowledged preeminence. The position of the latter may have been the consequence of the infamy which attached to the name of the traitor; but it is possible (and this may have been one of the elements that entered into his guilt) that his place had always been one of inferiority.<p>(2.) All the lists divide themselves into three groups of four, the persons in each group being always the same (assuming that the three names, Judas the <span class= "ital">brother</span> (?) of James, Thaddæus, and Lebbæus, belong to the same person), though the order in each group varies.<p>(3.) The first group includes the two sons of Jona and the two sons of Zebedee, whose twofold call is related in <a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18-21</a>, <a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>. In two lists (Mark and Acts) the name of Andrew stands last; in two (Matt. and Luke) that of John. In none of them are the names of Peter and John coupled together, as might have been expected from their close companionship (<a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>). The four obviously occupied the innermost place in the company of the Twelve, and were chosen out of the chosen. The three, Peter, James, and John, were the only witnesses of the healing of Jairus’s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm" title="And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.">Mark 5:37</a>), of the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>), and of the Agony in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-37.htm" title="And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.">Matthew 26:37</a>). Something seems to have excluded Andrew, though he had been the first called of all (<a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>), from this intimate companionship; but we find him joined with the other three as called to listen to the great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>). All the four appear to have come from Bethsaida, on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.<p>(4.) The name of Philip is always first in the second group, and he, too, came from Bethsaida. Next, in the three Gospel lists, comes that of Bartholomew. The name, like Barjona and Bartimæus, was obviously a patronymic, and it was at least probable that he had some other name. The absence of any mention of Bartholomew in St. John’s Gospel, or of Nathanael (<a href="/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>) in the other three, has led most modern commentators to the conclusion that they were two names for the same person; and the juxtaposition of the two names in their lists agrees with the fact that it was Philip who brought him to know Jesus as the Christ (<a href="/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>). On this assumption, Bartholomew was of Cana, the scene of our Lord’s first miracle (<a href="/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a>). The name of Matthew stands before that of Thomas in Mark and Luke, after it in the Gospel which beare his own name. On the change of name from Levi, and his description as the son of Alphæus, see Notes on <a href="/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.">Matthew 9:9</a>. As the name of Thomas, or Didymus, means “twin,” there seems some ground for believing, from the way in which the two names are grouped together, that here too we have another pair of brothers called to the service of their Master. Eusebius (<span class= "ital">H. E.</span> i. 13), in his account of the conversion of Abgarus of Edessa, speaks of this Apostle as “Judas who is also Thomas.” and this suggests the reason why the cognomen of “the Twin” prevailed over the name which was already borne by two out of the company of the Twelve.<p>(5.) The third group always begins with “James the son of Alphæus;” and this description suggests some interesting inferences:—(1.) That he too was a brother of Matthew (there are no grounds for assuming two persons of the name of Alphæus), and probably, therefore, of Thomas also. (2.) That if the Clopas (not Cleopas) of <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>, was, as is generally believed, only the less Græcised form of the name Alphæus, then his mother Mary may have been the sister of Mary the mother of the Lord (see Notes on <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>). (3.) This Mary, in her turn, is identified, on comparing <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a> with <a href="/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>, with the mother of James the Less (literally, <span class= "ital">the Little</span>) and of Joses. The term probably pointed, not to subordinate position, but, as in the case of Zacchæus, to short stature, and appears to have been an epithet (<a href="/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.">Luke 19:3</a>) distinguishing him from the James of the first list. The Greek form in both cases was Jacôbus—the Jacob of the Old Testament—which has passed, like Joannes, through many changes, till it appears in its present clipped and curtailed shape. (4.) On the assumption that the James and Joses of <a href="/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a> are two of the <span class= "ital">“</span>brethren of the Lord” of <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>, this James <span class= "ital">might,</span> perhaps, be identified with the James “the brother of the Lord” of <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a> and <a href="/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13</a>, the writer of the Epistle. The balance of evidence is, however, decidedly against this view. (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>.) The next name appears in three different forms: Judas the <span class= "ital">brother</span> of James (it must be noted, however, that the collocation of the two names is that which is elsewhere rendered “the son of . . .” and that the insertion of the word “brother” is an inference from <a href="/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>) in Luke and Acts; Lebbæus in Matthew (with the addition, in later MSS. and the <span class= "ital">textus receptus,</span> of “who is also surnamed Thaddæus”); Thaddæus in Mark; St. John names him simply as “Judas, not Iscariot” (<a href="/matthew/14-22.htm" title="And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.">Matthew 14:22</a>). The explanation of the variations is natural enough. One who bore the name of Judas wanted something to distinguish him. This might be found either in the term which expressed his relation as son or brother to James the son of Alphæus, or in a personal epithet. Lebbæus suggests a derivation from the Hebrew <span class= "ital">leb</span> (heart), and points to warmth and earnestness of character; <span class= "ital">thad,</span> in later Hebrew, meant the female breast, and may have been the origin of Thaddæus, as indicating, even more than the other sobriquet, a feminine devotedness. Taking the three names together, they suggest the thought that he was one of the youngest of the Twelve, and was looked upon by the others with an affection which showed itself in the name thus given to him. Simon, too, needed a distinguishing epithet, and it was found in the two forms of Zelotes and Cananite (not Canaanite). The former may point to zeal as his chief characteristic, but it was more probably used in the sense in which the followers of Judas of Galilee bore the name, and under which they were prominent in the later struggle with the Romans, as in a special sense “zealots for the law” (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, iv.</span> 3, § 9). (Comp. a like use of the word in <a href="/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:">Acts 21:20</a>.) On this assumption we get a glimpse, full of interest, into the earlier life of the Apostle so named. The other term, Cananite—which is not a local term, but connected with a Hebrew verb, <span class= "ital">kanà,</span> to be hot, to glow, to be zealous—expresses the same idea. Lastly, we have “Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him,” described by St. John as the “son of Simon” (<a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>; <a href="/john/12-4.htm" title="Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,">John 12:4</a>; <a href="/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>; <a href="/john/13-26.htm" title="Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.">John 13:26</a>), the term “Iscariot” being applied in the first and last of these passages to the father. These facts seem to leave little doubt that the name is local, and is the Græcised form of <span class= "ital">Ish-Kerioth</span> (a man of Kerioth), a town in Judah mentioned in the list of <a href="/joshua/15-25.htm" title="And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,">Joshua 15:25</a>. Assuming this inference, we have in him the only one among the Twelve of whom it is probable that he was of Judah, and not of Galilee. This also may not have been without its influence on his character, separating him, as it might well tend to do, from the devoted loyalty of the others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;...">Matthew 10:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The first, Simon </span>— The first who was called to a constant attendance on Christ: although Andrew had seen him before Simon, <a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>. <span class="ital">James the son of Zebedee </span>— The fisherman, <span class="ital">and John his brother </span>— The beloved disciple; who were also called at the same time with the two former, as they were fishing at the sea of Galilee, <a href="/mark/1-19.htm" title="And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.">Mark 1:19</a>.

Each of those evangelists has recorded the circumstances of their appointment. They agree in saying it was done on a mountain; and, according to Luke, it was done before the sermon on the mount was delivered, perhaps on the same mountain, near Capernaum. Luke adds that the night previous had been spent "in prayer" to God. See the notes at <a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>.<p>Simon, who is called Peter - The word "Peter" means a rock. He was also called Cephas, <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>. This was a Syro-Chaldaic word signifying the same as Peter. This name was given probably in reference to the "resoluteness and firmness" which he was to exhibit in preaching the gospel. Before the Saviour's death he was rash, impetuous, and unstable. Afterward, as all history affirms, he was firm, zealous, steadfast, and immovable. The tradition is that he was at last crucified at Rome with his head downward, thinking it too great an honor to die as his Master did. See the notes at <a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>. There is no certain proof, however, that this occurred at Rome, and no absolute knowledge as to the place where he died.<p>James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother - This James was killed by Herod in a persecution, <a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>. The other James, the son of Alpheus, was stationed at Jerusalem, and was the author of the epistle that bears his name. See <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>. A James is mentioned <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a> as "the Lord's brother." It has not been easy to ascertain why he was thus called. He is here called the son of "Alpheus," that is, of Cleophas, <a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. Alpheus and Cleophas were but different ways of writing and pronouncing the same name. This Mary, called the mother of James and Joses, is called the wife of Cleophas, <a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these&#8212;The other Evangelists enumerate the twelve in immediate connection with their appointment (Mr 3:13-19; Lu 6:13-16). But our Evangelist, not intending to record the appointment, but only the Mission of the Twelve, gives their names here. And as in the Acts (Ac 1:13) we have a list of the Eleven who met daily in the upper room with the other disciples after their Master's ascension until the day of Pentecost, we have four catalogues in all for comparison.<p>The first, Simon, who is called Peter&#8212;(See on [1252]Joh 1:42).<p>and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother&#8212;named after James, as the younger of the two.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these,.... This is the first time these disciples are called "apostles", they were learners before; now being instructed, they are sent forth to preach publicly, and therefore are called apostles, or messengers, persons that were sent: so the elders of the priesthood are called  , "the apostles", or messengers "of the sanhedrim" (n), to whom the high priest were delivered, before the day of atonement. So six months in the year,  "apostles", or messengers, were sent by the (o) sanhedrim, throughout all the land of Israel, and to the captive Jews in other parts, to give notice of the new moon; in allusion to which, the disciples might be so called. It was proper to give the names of them, for the truth of the history, and confirmation of it; for the sake of the persons themselves, and the honour done them; and for the exclusion and detection of false apostles. <p>The first, Simon, who is called Peter; his pure Hebrew name was   Simeon, as he is called, <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a> but in the then Jerusalem dialect, and in Rabbinical language, this name is frequently read and pronounced  "Simon", as here: we often read of R. Simon, and of R. Juda bar Simon, in both Talmuds (p). This apostle is also called Peter, to distinguish him from Simon the Canaanite, and which signifies a stone, or rock, in allusion to the object of his faith, and the steadiness of it. He is said to be the "first"; not that he was the head of the rest of the apostles, or had any primacy, dominion, and authority over them; but because he was first called, and was the first that was to open the door of faith to the Gentiles: but chiefly he is said to be so for order's sake; for, some one in the account must be named first, and he as proper as any: <p>and Andrew his brother; who was called at the same time with him, and therefore are put together.

The Greek word lit. = “sent forth,” “envoys.” This sense, though scarcely recognised by classical authors, was not new. It seems to have been a “title borne by those who were despatched from the mother city by the rulers of the race on any foreign mission, especially such as were charged with collecting the tribute paid to the temple service.” (Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Gal.</span> p. 90). The title of “apostles” was given in a special sense to the Twelve, but was not confined to them. Matthias was added to the number of the twelve, Paul was “called to be an apostle,” James the Lord’s brother, and Barnabas, are designated by the same title. It had even a wider signification: cp. among other passages <a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>.

The first and third arrangements correspond generally to the time of their vocation, and the conjunction of the apostles in twos; the second, to their dignity before our Lord’s passion; the fourth, to their dignity after His ascension. All the arrangements may be divided into three quaternions, none of which interchanges any name with either of the others.[445] Again, Peter stands always first in the first quaternion, Philip in the second (cf. <a href="/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>; <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a>), James the son of Alphaeus in the third; though, within their several quaternions, the other apostles exchange their relative position [in the different lists]. The traitor stands always last. The plan of the first and third quaternions is contained in what I have just said: in the second, Matthew places himself modestly after his[446] Thomas, thus proving himself to be the writer of the book; for both Mark and Luke put Thomas after Matthew, although St Luke, after the confirmation of Thomas’s faith (<a href="/context/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing....">John 20:27-28</a>), puts him, in the Acts, even above Bartholomew, and associates him with Philip. From the first quaternion we have the writings of Peter and John; from the second, that of Matthew; from the third, those of James and Jude, or Thaddeus. St John has not enumerated the apostles in his Gospel, but he has done so by implication in the Apocalypse; see <a href="/context/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones.

Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-19</a>; <a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13-16</a> (cf. <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>). This Commentary upon St. Luke deals so fully both with the list as a whole and with the separate names that it will not be necessary to say much here. Observe that the general agreement in arrangement points to some common basis underlying all four accounts; also that of these the one found in the Acts is the briefest, giving little more than the bare names; and that that found in our Gospel, on the contrary, is the fullest, containing, with two exceptions (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), the details mentioned in one or other of the parallels, and adding two of its own. It mentions, in one instance or more, the parentage (Zebedee, Alphaeus), the relationship ("his brother...  his brother"), the birthplace (Kerioth), the earlier occupation and religious standpoint ("publican...  Zealot"), and, with a bare hint at the beginning (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), but a clear statement at the end, the after-history ("first... who also betrayed him") of the apostles. The two omissions are the fact that our Lord added the names of Peter (parallels, but really given earlier, <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>) and Boanerges (Mark). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the names,</span> In the parallels part of the word "names" is found as a verb, "whom also he named apostles;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the naming there refers, not to the individuals, but to their office. Is the form found in our Gospel an "accidental" rearrangement due to a reminiscence that the word "name" occurred in the earliest source, or is it possible that the two facts are connected, and that the individuals received a new name when they definitely entered on a new office? That they should have received a new name seems <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">priori</span> not improbable, but the evidence is very slight. "Peter" is a clear case, for though the name <span class="accented">was</span> given earlier, it would receive a new application now, and perhaps was now again expressly given (cf. parallel passages); and other cases may be St. Matthew (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.) and possibly St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddaeus. Mark expressly says that the term "<span class="accented">Boanerges"</span> was given to the sons of Zebedee; but as there is no evidence that either St. James or St. John was afterwards known by this name, it need not have been a name in the same sense in which the others were. Observe the formal order of the first words of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Did the author of the Gospel take them from the heading of a section that already contained the names in order? If so the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> would probably not have existed there, and it is worth noting that the original hand of D, the manuscript that is of special value for Palestinian tradition, omits it. <span class="cmt_word">Of the twelve</span> (ver. 1, note) <span class="cmt_word">apostles</span> (ver. 5, note) <span class="cmt_word">are these: The first</span>. This, perhaps, refers to the order of call, <a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a> (Nosgen), but more probably to the leading position that St. Peter held among the twelve. On this leadership, cf. the fragmentary excursus by Bishop Lightfoot, printed in 'Clement of Rome,' 2. 487 (1890). <span class="cmt_word">Simon</span>. His Hebrew name was Simeon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, and <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>, in the Received Text and Westcott and Herr margin), but his Gentile name (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note) was Simon, this good Greek name being chosen as almost identical in sound. It occurs frequently in the Palestinian Talmud (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Who is called Peter</span>.

Compare <a href="/john/13-16.htm">John 13:16</a> and Rev., one that is sent. Cremer ("Biblico-Theological Lexicon") suggests that it was the rare occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it all the more appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the twelve.
