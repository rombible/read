They were to avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial. The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will. Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac 20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him in all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These little ones - By "these little ones" are clearly meant his disciples.<p>They are called "little ones" to denote their want of wealth, rank, learning, and whatever the world calls "great." They were "little" in the estimation of the world and in their own estimation. They were "learners," not yet "teachers;" and they made no pretensions to what attracts the admiration of mankind.<p>A cup of cold" water "only - Few would refuse a cup of cold water to any man, if thirsty and weary, and yet not all people would give it to such a one "because he was a Christian," or to express attachment to the Lord Jesus. In bestowing it on a man "because he was a Christian," he would show love to the Saviour himself; in the other case he would give it from mere sympathy or kindness, evincing no regard for the Christian, the Christian's Master, or his cause. In one case he would show that he loved the cause of religion; in the other case, he would not.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a><p>1. From the narrative in this chapter, in connection with that in Luke, we are permitted to see the Saviour's habits in regard to prayer. An important event was before him; an event on which, humanly speaking, depended the whole success of his religion - the choice of those who should be his messengers to mankind. He felt its importance; and even the Son of God sought the place of prayer, and during the nightwatches asked the direction of his Father. His example shows that we, in great and trying circumstances, should seek particularly the direction of God.<p>2. We see the benevolence of the gospel, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-7.htm">Matthew 10:7-8</a>. The apostles were to confer the highest favors on mankind without reward. Like air, and sunbeams, and water - gifts of God - they are without price. The poor are welcome; the rich, unaided by their wealth, are welcome also; the wide world may freely come and partake the rich blessings or the gospel of peace.<p>3. Ministers of the gospel, and all the followers of Jesus, should depend on the providence of God for support and the supply of their wants, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-9.htm">Matthew 10:9-10</a>. He sent his apostles into a cold, unfriendly world, and he took care of them. So none that trust Him shall lack. The righteous shall not be forsaken. The God who has in His hand all the pearls of the ocean, the gold in the heart of the earth, and the cattle on a thousand hills, and that feeds the raven when it cries, will hear the cries of His children and supply their needs.<p>4. We see the duty of treating kindly the messengers of salvation, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11-13</a>. Christ expected that in every city and town they would find some who would welcome them. He promised the reward of a prophet to those who should receive a prophet, and assured those of his favor who had nothing better to bestow than even a cup of cold water. The ministers of religion are sent to benefit the world. It is but right that in that world they should be kindly received, and that their wants should be supplied.<p>5. The guilt of rejecting the gospel, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14-15</a>. It is not a small matter to reject an offer of heaven. A palace, a throne, a rich earthly inheritance, might be rejected, and, compared with rejecting the gospel, it would be a trifle. But life eternal is not like thrones, and gold, and palaces. This lost, all is lost. The gospel rejected, all is gone. Nor hope nor happiness awaits him that hath spurned this offer. God requires everyone to believe the gospel; and woe, woe, a greater woe than befell guilty Sodom and Gomorrah, to him who rejects it.<p>6. Judgment will certainly overtake the guilty, <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>. It fell upon Sodom, and it will fall on all transgressors. None shall escape. Damnation may slumber long over the wicked, and they may long mock the God of truth, but in due time their feet will slide, and the whole creation shall not be able to save them from woe. How dangerous, how awful is the condition of an impenitent sinner!<p>7. We are to take proper care of our lives, <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>. The apostles were to flee from danger, when they could do it without denying their Lord. So are we. He that throws away his life when it might have been, and ought to have been preserved, is a self-murderer. He that exposes himself when duty does not require it, and whose life pays the forfeit, goes before God "rushing unbidden into his Maker's presence," nor can he be held guiltless.<p>8. We are to persevere "in our duty" through all trials, <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>. Neither the world, nor pain, nor poverty, nor persecution. nor death is to appal us. He that endures to the end shall be saved. We have but one thing to do - to do the will of God, to "be Christians everywhere," and to leave the event with him.<p>9. God exercises a particular providence, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-30</a>. He watches the falling sparrow, numbers the hairs of the head, and for the same reason he presides over all other things. The Lord reigneth, says the Psalmist, let the earth rejoice, <a href="/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1</a>.<p>10. The duty of making a profession of religion, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32-33</a>. It must be done in a proper way, or Christ will disown us in the day of judgment. It is impossible to neglect it, and have evidence of piety. If ashamed of him, he will be ashamed of us.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones&#8212;Beautiful epithet! Originally taken from Zec 13:7.

That <span class="ital">hearing</span> is one branch of it, Luke tells us. The scope of the context, and the words that follow, do manifest that a giving entertainment to them in their houses is another thing here meant. There is another more inward, receiving of their doctrine by faith and love, to which undoubtedly there will be a great reward. But whether it be here intended, I doubt. Our Saviour was sending the twelve out, he had commanded them to take with them no gold, silver, nor brass, no scrip, &c.; but when they came into any city, to inquire who there were in that city who were worthy men, favourers to the gospel, and ready to entertain strangers, and to go to their house or houses, saluting them, and to abide there till they left the place. He furnisheth them here as it were with a ticket, or bill of exchange. He gives them an assurance, that whatsoever kindness should be done to them, he would account it as done to himself. And further hath assured both them, and all the world, that if any should come to them to reveal the will of God, (for that the term <span class="ital">prophet</span> signifieth), if they give him an entertainment upon that account they should be rewarded. What is here meant by the term, <span class="ital">a prophet’s reward, </span> is variously guessed, whether it be, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The reward which God hath appointed for such as entertain his prophets; or; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Such a reward as such a prophet shall himself receive; or; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The reward which the prophet; will give him or them, viz. prayers and instruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That which appears to me most probable is, that no more is meant than a liberal reward, for such shall be the reward of those who <span class="ital">turn many to righteousness, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a></span>. Those words, <span class="ital">in the name of a prophet, </span> are both exclusive of those from the benefit of this promise who receive and entertain the ministers of the gospel upon any other account than this, that they are the Lord’s prophets; and also encouraging to those who may discern they have been mistaken in their acts of charity of this nature; if they have been sincere in their designs and actions, they shall not lose their reward, though the pretended prophet so entertained prove but an impostor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> Christ will not only reward those who show love to his prophets, but those who show kindness to his members, whom the world counts contemptible, and calleth <span class="ital">little ones; </span> nor shall those only be rewarded who give them great entertainments, and make them great presents, but (if it be proportionable to what they are able to do) though it be a kindness of the most minute consideration, but <span class="ital">a cup of cold water, </span> they shall be rewarded. God rewards the love we show to him, and the good actions that flow from it. Here are three persons mentioned, for whose entertainment and reception God hath provided in this promise; <span class="ital">a prophet, a righteous man, a little one:</span> and a threefold reward promised; the reward of a prophet, the reward of a righteous man, and his reward. How to distinguish the righteous man and the little one I cannot tell, unless we understand by the righteous man one more perfect, more eminent in holiness; and by the little one, one that is sincere, though we cannot judge him so grown in grace and the knowledge of Christ. I should understand no more by the threefold rewards, than God’s more particular value for his ministers, and for such as are more perfect in holiness; while in the mean time he will not <span class="ital">break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax; </span> and that every one shall be rewarded according to his works; which shall not be measured by the quantity of the gift, but by the obedience, and affection, and ability of the giver, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/21-2.htm" title="And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.">Luke 21:2</a>,3 Heb 6:10</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones,.... Our Lord gradually descends from prophets to righteous men, and from righteous men, to those of the lowest form and class among them; who have the least measure of grace, and share of spiritual light, and knowledge; who are outwardly the poorest, meanest, and most contemptible in the eyes of the world; and are little, even the least of saints, in their own esteem and account: whosoever takes notice but of "one" of these, receives him into his house, and gives him <p>a cup of cold water only, is regarded, a phrase used to express the least favour, or benefit whatever. <p>"So says (t) Maimonides, one that calls to his friend to dine with him, and he refuses, and swears, or vows, that he shall not enter into his house, nor will he give him to drink,  "a drop of cold water", &amp;c.'' <p>Moreover, this is said to prevent any objection, on account of the mean and low condition persons may be in, to their relieving necessitous objects; for everyone is capable of doing this, and if they can do no more, it is accepted. Now whosoever takes notice of, and shows favour to the meanest of Christ's people, though it be but bestowing so small a benefit as a cup of cold water; yet, if it is done <p>in the name of a disciple, or because that poor person is a disciple of Christ, <p>verily, says Christ, <p>I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward: it will be observed another day by Christ, who takes what is done to the least of his brethren, as done to himself. The Jews say many things in praise of hospitality, to , "a disciple of a wise man"; and observe (u), that he that hospitably entertains such an one in his house, and causes him to eat and drink, and partake of the goods of his house, there is reason to believe, he shall be much more blessed than the house of Obed Edom was for the ark's sake, which neither ate nor drank with him; and which may be compared with this passage. <p>(t) Hilchot Nedarim, c. 8. sect. 10.

The simplest act of kindness done to one of Christ’s little ones <span class="ital">as such</span> shall have its reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/10-42.htm" title="And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.">Matthew 10:42</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μικρῶν</span>, <span class="ital">little ones</span>) (see ch. <a href="/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones.">Zechariah 13:7</a>). A sweet epithet for <span class="ital">disciples</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/10-41.htm" title="He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.">Matthew 10:41</a>, for the double mention of <span class="ital">prophet</span>, etc.) The world cares not for such as these.

It is evident, from a comparison of ver. 41, that the two titles refer to one and the same person.

He is now speaking of one who is not distinguished from other believers by the reception of extraordinary Divine gifts, or by special zeal and holiness, but is only an ordinary disciple. In <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> the term is used directly of children, but in <a href="/luke/17-2.htm">Luke 17:2</a>, and probably in <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41, 42</a>, it is used metaphorically. <span class="cmt_word">A cup of cold water only</span>.
