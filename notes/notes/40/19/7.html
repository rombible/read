They fell back from what would seem to them a vague abstract principle upon the letter of the Law. Was Moses, the great lawgiver, sanctioning what God had forbidden? Would the Prophet of Nazareth commit Himself to anything so bold as that?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/19-7.htm" title="They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorce, and to put her away?...">Matthew 19:7-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">They say, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, </span>&c. — “If divorce be contrary to the original institution of marriage, as you affirm, how came it that Moses has <span class="ital">commanded </span>us to give a bill of divorce? &c. The Pharisees, by calling the law concerning divorce a <span class="ital">command, </span>insinuated that Moses had been so tender of their happiness that he would not suffer them to live with bad wives, though they themselves had been willing; but peremptorily enjoined, that such should be put away.” He saith, <span class="ital">Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts </span>— Because neither your fathers nor you could bear the more excellent way; <span class="ital">suffered, </span>(or <span class="ital">permitted,</span>) <span class="ital">not commanded, you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so </span>— And the account which Moses himself gives of the original constitution of things, which has now been referred to, proves it to be an irregularity which must have no place under the gospel dispensation. <span class="ital">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication </span>— Which is a fundamental breach of the main article of the marriage covenant, by which they are one flesh; <span class="ital">and shall marry another, committeth adultery </span>— Against her that was his former wife, and who continues still to be so in the sight of God. As the law of Moses allowed divorce, for the hardness of men’s hearts, and the law of Christ forbids it, we learn from hence that Christians being under a dispensation of love and liberty, tenderness of heart may justly be expected among them, and that they should not be hard-hearted like the Jews. Indeed there will be no occasion for divorces if we bear with one another, and forgive one another in love, as those that are and hope to be forgiven of God, and have found him reluctant to put us away, <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.">Isaiah 50:1</a>. Divorces are unnecessary if husbands love their wives, and wives be obedient to their husbands, and they dwell together as <span class="ital">heirs of the grace of life. </span>These are the laws of Christ, and such as we find not in all the law of Moses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:3-12 The Pharisees were desirous of drawing something from Jesus which they might represent as contrary to the law of Moses. Cases about marriage have been numerous, and sometimes perplexed; made so, not by the law of God, but by the lusts and follies of men; and often people fix what they will do, before they ask for advice. Jesus replied by asking whether they had not read the account of the creation, and the first example of marriage; thus pointing out that every departure therefrom was wrong. That condition is best for us, and to be chosen and kept to accordingly, which is best for our souls, and tends most to prepare us for, and preserve us to, the kingdom of heaven. When the gospel is really embraced, it makes men kind relatives and faithful friends; it teaches them to bear the burdens, and to bear with the infirmities of those with whom they are connected, to consider their peace and happiness more than their own. As to ungodly persons, it is proper that they should be restrained by laws, from breaking the peace of society. And we learn that the married state should be entered upon with great seriousness and earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why did Moses ... - To this they objected that Moses had allowed such divorces <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; and if he had allowed them, they inferred that they could not be unlawful.
