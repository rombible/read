The fact that they were brought (we may assume by their mothers) indicates that there was something in our Lord’s look and manner that attracted children, and impressed their parents with the feeling that He loved them. That feeling, we may well believe, was deepened by His acts and words when He had taken in His arms the child whom He set before His disciples as a pattern of the true greatness of humility, and taught them that the angels of those little ones beheld the face of His Father (<a href="/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>). The motives of the disciples in rebuking those that brought them, may, in like manner, be connected with what they had just heard from their Master’s lips. What interest, they might have thought, could He have in these infants, when He had in those words appeared to claim for the “eunuch” life a special dignity and honour? What could the pressing claims of mothers and their children be to Him but a trouble and vexation, interfering with the higher life of meditation and of prayer?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them....">Matthew 19:13-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then were brought unto him little children </span>— Luke says, <span class="greekheb">βρεφη</span>, <span class="ital">infants. </span>It is not said by whom they were brought, but probably it was by their parents or guardians: and herein, 1st, they testified their respect for Christ, and the value they set upon his favour and blessing: and, 2d, manifested their love to their children, not doubting but it would be for their benefit in this world and the next to have the blessing and prayers of the Lord Jesus, whom they looked upon at least as an extraordinary person, a holy man, and as a prophet, if not also as the Messiah, and the blessings of such were valued and desired. Observe, reader, they who glorify Christ by coming to him themselves, ought further to glorify him by bringing their children to him likewise, and all upon whom they have influence. <span class="ital">That he should put his hands on them and pray </span>— It appears to have been customary among the Jews, when one person prayed for another who was present, to lay his hand upon the person’s head; and this imposition of hands was a ceremony used in ancient times, especially in paternal blessing: thus Jacob, when he blessed and adopted the sons of Joseph, laid his hands upon their heads, <a href="/context/genesis/48-14.htm" title="And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn....">Genesis 48:14-20</a>. <span class="ital">And the disciples rebuked them </span>— That is, them that brought the children; probably thinking such an employ beneath the dignity of their Master. <span class="ital">But Jesus said, Suffer little children to come unto me </span>— Mark says, that when <span class="ital">Jesus saw it, </span>that is, observing his disciples rebuking those that brought the children, <span class="ital">he was much displeased, </span>namely, to find his disciples so defective in benevolence toward objects whose innocence and helplessness entitled them to great affection from persons of riper years. He ordered them therefore to let the children be brought to him; saying, <span class="ital">For of such is the kingdom of heaven </span>— The Church of God on earth, and his kingdom in heaven, is composed of persons who resemble little children in their dispositions; and children, even in a natural sense, have a right to be admitted into his kingdom, the gospel authorizing the ministers of Christ to admit the children of believing parents into his church by baptism, and those that die in infancy being undoubtedly heirs of eternal glory. <span class="ital">And he laid his hands on them, </span>as he was desired to do, <span class="ital">and blessed them, </span><a href="/mark/10-16.htm" title="And he took them up in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.">Mark 10:16</a>; recommended them in a solemn manner to the divine blessing and favour.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:13-15 It is well when we come to Christ ourselves, and bring our children. Little children may be brought to Christ as needing, and being capable of receiving blessings from him, and having an interest in his intercession. We can but beg a blessing for them: Christ only can command the blessing. It is well for us, that Christ has more love and tenderness in him than the best of his disciples have. And let us learn of him not to discountenance any willing, well-meaning souls, in their seeking after Christ, though they are but weak. Those who are given to Christ, as part of his purchase, he will in no wise cast out. Therefore he takes it ill of all who forbid, and try to shut out those whom he has received.

Probably these were brought by some of his followers, who desired not only to devote themselves to Jesus, but all that they had - their children as well as themselves. All the Jews were accustomed to devote their children to God by circumcision. It was natural, therefore, under the new dispensation, that it should be done. Luke says they were infants. They were undoubtedly those who were not old enough to come by choice, but their coming was an act of the parents.<p>Put his hands on them and pray - It was customary among the Jews, when blessings were sought for others in prayer, to lay the hands on the head of the person prayed for, implying a kind of consecration to God. See <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>. They had also much confidence in the prayers of pious men, believing that those blessed by a saint or a prophet would be happy.

It is not likely it was for healing; for though our Saviour in such cases did sometimes touch or lay his hand upon the sick persons, yet it is not likely that in that case the disciples would have rebuked them, knowing that their Master used to heal such as were brought to him. It must therefore unquestionably be, that he might bless them. Matthew here saith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that he should put his hands on them, </span> and pray.

It does not appear that they were new born babes; the words used by either of the evangelists do not always signify such, but are sometimes used of such as are capable of going alone; yea, of receiving instructions, of understanding the Scriptures, and even of one of twelve years of age, <a href="/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2</a> nor is it probable that infants just born, or within a month, should be had abroad. Moreover, these were such as Christ called unto him, <a href="/luke/18-16.htm">Luke 18:16</a> and were capable of coming to him of themselves, as his words following suppose; nor does their being brought to him, or his taking them in his arms, contradict this; since the same things are said of such as could walk of themselves, <a href="/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a> <a href="/mark/9-36.htm">Mark 9:36</a>. Nor is it known whose children they were, whether their parents were believers or unbelievers, nor by whom they were brought: but the end for which they were brought is expressed, <p>that he should put his hands on them, and pray; not that he should baptize them, nor did he; which may be concluded from the entire silence of all the evangelists; and from an express declaration that Christ baptized none; and from the mention of other ends for which they were brought, as that Christ should "touch" them, <a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13</a> as he sometimes used to do persons, when he healed them of diseases; and probably some of those infants, if not all of them, were diseased, and brought to be cured; otherwise, it is not easy to conceive what they should be touched by him for: or as here, that he might put his hands on them, and pray over them, and bless them, as was usual with the Jews to do; see <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a> and it was common with them to bring their children to venerable persons, men of note for religion and piety, to have their blessing and prayers (y): <p>and the disciples rebuked them; not the children, as the Persic version reads, but those that brought them, Mark observes; either because they came in a rude and disorderly manner, and were very noisy and clamorous; or they might think it would be too troublesome to Christ, to go through such a ceremony with so many of them; or that it was too mean for him, and below him to take notice of them; or for fear he should take fresh occasion, on the sight of these children, to rebuke them again for their pride and ambition. However, from this rebuke and prohibition of the disciples, it looks plainly as if it had never been the practice of the Jews, nor of John the Baptist, nor of Christ and his disciples, to baptize infants; for had this been then in use, they would scarcely have forbid and rebuked those that brought them, since they might have thought they brought them to be baptized; but knowing of no such usage that ever obtained in that nation, neither among those that did, or did not believe in Christ, they forbad them. <p>(y) Massechet Sopherim, c. 18. sect. 5. see the note on Luke ii. 42. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put <i>his</i> hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span><p>(4) The elect infants and little children are contained in the free covenant of God.

These were babes whom the mothers carried in their arms, and who were too young to understand the meaning and importance of the act of Christ in blessing them. It was a custom to take infants to the synagogues, that they might receive the prayers and blessings of the rabbis, or holy men. For this reason they were brought to Christ as a holy and revered Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">That he should put his hands on them, and pray.</span> The laying on of hands was symbolical of blessing  (see <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>).

Why they did so is not quite obvious. Either they thought that it was beneath Christ's dignity, and a waste of his precious time to attend to these babes; or, being still of imperfect faith, they did not realize that any spiritual good could proceed from the imposition of Christ's hands upon unconscious and irresponsive infants. They had seen him cure bodily diseases with a touch, and they would have welcomed these little ones it' they had been brought to be healed of some obvious maladies; what they could not understand was that these irrational creatures, not possessed of faith, could be the recipients of Divine blessing. Christ, by word and action, teaches another lesson. St. Mark adds that Jesus was "much displeased" at the disciples' faithless interference.
