But St. Matthew's narrative omits many events that happened in the interval between the account of the Galilaean ministry and the history of these last days, that is, from the autumn of one year to the spring of the next. The transactions of this time, which are omitted also by St. Mark, are given by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-17:11</a>) and St. John (<a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2-11:54</a>), comprising many things that occurred at Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles and on other occlusions. <span class="cmt_word">He departed from Galilee.</span> Not visiting it again till he appeared there after his resurrection. There was no part of the Holy Land in which he did not at some time sojourn, and now, as the final consummation drew nigh, he resolutely set his face towards Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="accented">Coasts</span> should be <span class="accented">borders</span>. Judaea was bounded by the river, and there was no part of it beyond, that is, on the east of Jordan. The words, "beyond Jordan," belong to the verb "came," and the clause signifies that the object of Christ's journey was the vicinity of Judaea, and that, instead of entering the province by the direct road through Samaria, he took the more lengthy but safer route through Peraea. This was the name of the region on the east of the Jordan (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">beyond</span>), extending at this time from the river Hieromax, or Jarmouk, on the north, to the Arnon on the south, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the middle of the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The ruler of this district was Herod Antipas, and it was at this era in a most flourishing condition, notably fertile, and containing many fine towns ornamented with magnificent buildings. Here the simple, pastoral country people were less influenced by the narrow bigotry of the Pharisaic party, and in the towns the ban which excluded Jesus from the synagogues of Galilee and Judaea was either not recognized or not enforced. A quiet opportunity for preaching the gospel was thus offered. This may possibly be the sojourn in Peraea mentioned by St. John (<a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40-42</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Coasts (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)<p>Better Rev., borders; though it is easy to see how the translation coasts arose, coast being derived from the Latin costa, a side, and hence a border generally, though now applied to the sea-side only. </body></html>
