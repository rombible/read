The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it.

He said, therefore, that he would chastise him and let him go. He expected, probably, by causing him to be publicly whipped, to excite their compassion, to satisfy "them," and thus to evade the demands of the priests, and to set him at liberty with the consent of the people. So weak and irresolute was this Roman governor! Satisfied of his innocence, he should at once have preferred "justice to popularity," and acted as became a magistrate in acquitting the innocent.<p>Let him be crucified - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>.

And the soldiers platted a crown of</span> <span class="ital">thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, </span> <span class="ital">and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their</span> <span class="ital">hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, </span> <span class="ital">Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no</span> <span class="ital">fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, </span> <span class="ital">and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="ital">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried</span> <span class="ital">out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, </span> <span class="ital">Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. The Jews</span> <span class="ital">answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, </span> <span class="ital">because he made himself the Son of God. When Pilate therefore</span> <span class="ital">heard that saying, he was the more afraid; and went again into the</span> <span class="ital">judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus</span> <span class="ital">gave him no answer. Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not</span> <span class="ital">unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and</span> <span class="ital">have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no</span> <span class="ital">power at all against me, except it were given thee from above:</span> <span class="ital">therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. And</span> <span class="ital">from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried</span> <span class="ital">out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s</span> <span class="ital">friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</span> I have not given the reader at one view what all the evangelists say, as thinking it scarce possible from them all to set down the order how things passed at this trial; but only, that I might take notice of what was remarkable in it, related from one or other of them. The reason of our reading so often of Pilate’s going out, and then again coming on to the judgment seat, seemeth to be because, as we heard before, the Jews would not come into Pilate’s house, but stood at the door; and, on the other side, I conceive that he could not proceed judicially but sitting upon the tribunal, or seat of judgment. So as, though he could proceed in judgment within the house, with the attendance of his own servants, soldiers, and officers; yet, when he had any thing to propound to the Jews, he went out. We cannot think that the evangelists report all the things the Jews objected against our Saviour, nor all the questions by Pontius Pilate propounded to him. For the evangelists tell us, summarily, that they accused him of many things, and Pilate saith, <span class="ital">Hearest thou not how many things</span> <span class="ital">they witness against thee?</span> There was, it seems, but one thing that they most insisted upon, that was, his making himself a king, as to which we heard before how our Lord cleared himself. In the whole process of this trial these things are remarkable: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Our Saviour’s silence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Pilate’s equity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The rage and madness of the chief priests, scribes, and people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Our Saviour’s silence confirms to us that piece of the law of nature, that no man is bound to accuse himself. Pilate’s equity appears in many things: He would not condemn him without a particular hearing of his cause himself, he would not force him to accuse himself; he accepts our Saviour’s vindication of himself, as to the great thing wherewith he was charged; he twice declares that he found no fault in him; he studies expedients to deliver an innocent person from their rage; he sends him to Herod, and obtains his concurrent suffrage to his innocency; he offereth to release him according to a custom they had at the passover to deliver one, whomsoever they desired; when this would not do, he caused him to be scourged, then brings him out to them again, hoping to have moved them to compassion by that lighter punishment of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The rage and madness of the Jews, principally of the chief priests and scribes, appeared in their urging to have had our Saviour condemned without hearing; their excessive clamours against him; their preferring one before him who was a robber, a murderer, one that had made a public insurrection; their insisting so much upon the kind of death that he should die, viz. by crucifying him, though in that they did both fulfil the counsel of God, who had determined that he should be <span class="ital">made a curse for us, </span> and it was written, <span class="ital">Cursed is every</span> <span class="ital">one that hangeth on a tree, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a></span>, and what himself had prophesied, that he should be delivered to the Gentiles, and they should mock, and scourge, and crucify him, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a></span>. But that which is most remarkable is, the providence of God, for the evidencing of our Saviour’s innocency. Pilate’s wife calls him a <span class="ital">just man.</span> Pilate twice tells them that he found no fault in him. They are able to say nothing when Pilate asks them, <span class="ital">What evil hath he done?</span> Herod objects nothing against him. He is merely condemned upon the brutish clamour and rage of the rabble, incensed and set on fire by the chief priests and Pharisees. The art of these his adversaries is also observable, because it is the same which the enemies of the gospel, deriving from this first pattern, have ever since observed in the execution of their malice against the preachers aud faithful professors of the gospel. They durst not insist upon the doctrine which our Saviour preached, which was the true cause of their malice against him, but bring him under a charge of treason and sedition, as if he had gone about to make himself a king in opposition to the Roman emperor; though there was not the least pretence for any such thing, and if there had, none who considereth that they were a conquered people, and how zealous they upon all occasions showed themselves for their civil liberties, can imagine they had any great kindness for Caesar. It is very observable, that malice against religion and godliness, and a desire of the extirpation of it, and the professors of it, is the predominant lust in the hearts of wicked men. To serve this, they not only deny their own reason, and principles of common justice, but deny themselves likewise in some other lusts. And herein they show themselves the true seed of the serpent, and the children of the devil, whose works they do; who, though he be the proudest spirit, yet, to destroy a soul, will abate his pride, truckle to a poor witch, and go upon her errands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the governor said, why, what evil hath he done?....
