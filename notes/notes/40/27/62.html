This was, as we find from what follows, the Sabbath. The “preparation” (<span class= "ital">Paraskeuè</span>) was a technical term, not, as is sometimes said, in reference to preparing for the Passover, but, as in <a href="/mark/15-42.htm" title="And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,">Mark 15:42</a>, to a preparation for the Sabbath (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xvi.</span> 6, § 2, is decisive on this point), and the use of the term here leaves the question whether the Last Supper or the Crucifixion coincided with the Passover, still an open one. It may be noted that the Jewish use of the term passed into the Christian Church, and that at least as early as Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. vii.</span> § 76) it was the received name for the <span class= "ital">Dies Veneris,</span> or Friday, the anniversary of the Crucifixion being the “great” or “holy” <span class= "ital">Paraskeue.</span> On either view, however, there is something strange in the way in which St. Matthew describes the day as coming, “after the preparation,” instead of saying simply, “the Sabbath.” It is a possible solution of the difficulty thus presented, on the assumption that the Last Supper was a true Passover, that the day of the Crucifixion as being on the Passover, was itself technically a Sabbath (<a href="/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.">Leviticus 23:24</a>). Two Sabbaths therefore came together, and this may have led the Evangelist to avoid the commoner phrase, and to describe the second as being “the day that followed the preparation,” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span> the ordinary weekly Sabbath. The precise time at which the priests went to Pilate is not stated; probably it was early on the morning of the Sabbath when they had heard from the Roman soldiers of the burial by Joseph of Arimathæa. The fact that the body was under the care of one who was secretly a disciple aroused their suspicions, and they would naturally take the first opportunity, even at the risk of infringing on the Sabbath rest, of guarding against the fraud which they suspected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/27-62.htm" title="Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,...">Matthew 27:62-66</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now the next day; </span>the day <span class="ital">that followed the day of the preparation </span>— That is, after the sun was set, for the Jewish day began then. The day of preparation was the day before the sabbath, whereon they were to prepare for the celebration of it. The next day, then, (namely, Saturday,) was the sabbath, according to the Jews. But the evangelist seems to express it by this circumlocution, to show that the Jewish sabbath was then abolished. <span class="ital">The chief priests, &c., came together unto Pilate — </span>The chief priests and Pharisees, remembering that Jesus had predicted his own resurrection more than once, came to the governor and informed him of it begging that a guard might be ordered to the sepulchre, lest the disciples should carry his body away and affirm that he was risen from the dead. But they took this measure not on the morrow, in our sense of the word, but in the evening, after sunsetting, when the Jewish sabbath was begun, and when they understood the body was buried. To have delayed it to sunrising would have been preposterous, as the disciples might have stolen the body away during the preceding night. Besides, there is no inconsistency between this account of the time when the watch was placed and the subsequent articles of the history, which proceed upon the supposition that the women present at our Lord’s funeral were ignorant that any watch was placed at his grave. For they departed so early, that they had time to buy spices and ointments in the city before the preparation of the sabbath was ended; whereas the watch was not placed till the sabbath began. <span class="ital">Saying, Sir </span>— Thus the word <span class="greekheb">Κυριε </span>is here very properly rendered, as in many other places it is as improperly translated <span class="ital">lord. </span>It should certainly always be translated <span class="ital">sir, </span>when no more than civil respect is intended. <span class="ital">We remember that deceiver said, After three days </span>— Or, as<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετα τρεις ημερας </span>may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">within three days, I will rise again </span>— We do not find that he had ever said this to <span class="ital">them, </span>unless when <span class="ital">he spoke of the temple of his body, </span>(<a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>; <a href="/john/2-21.htm" title="But he spoke of the temple of his body.">John 2:21</a>.) And if they here refer to what he then said, how perverse and iniquitous was their construction on these words, when he was on his trial before the council!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>. Then they seemed not to understand them! Perhaps, however, they may refer to what he said (when the scribes and Pharisees demanded a sign of him) respecting the Prophet Jonas, namely, that as Jonas was <span class="ital">three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, </span>the Son of man should be so long <span class="ital">in the heart of the earth. </span>Or, on some occasion not mentioned by the evangelists, our Lord may have made a public declaration of his resurrection in the very terms here set down. But, in whatever way they came to the knowledge of it, certain it is that the chief priests and Pharisees were well acquainted with our Lord’s predictions concerning it; and hence the precaution and care which they used in guarding the sepulchre, all which was overruled by the providence of God to give the strongest proofs of Christ’s ensuing resurrection. <span class="ital">Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure </span>— This, as being a servile work, it might be thought they would not ask to be done on the sabbath. But we must observe, that they asked this of Romans, whom they did not consider as bound by the law of the sabbath. Jews to this day do not scruple to avail themselves of the work done by Christians on the Jewish sabbath. <span class="ital">Pilate said, Ye have a guard — </span>“Pilate, thinking their request reasonable, allowed them to take as many soldiers as they pleased of the cohort which, at the feast, came from the castle Antonia, and kept guard in the porticoes of the temple. For that they were not Jewish but Roman soldiers whom the priests employed to watch the sepulchre, is evident from their asking them of the governor. Besides, when the soldiers returned with the news of Christ’s resurrection, the priests desired them to report that his disciples had stolen him away while they slept; and, to encourage them to tell the falsehood boldly, promised, that if their neglect of duty came to the governor’s ears, proper means should be used to pacify him and keep them safe; a promise which there was no need of making to their own servants.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">So they went — </span>The priests and Pharisees having got a party of soldiers, placed them in their post, <span class="ital">and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone</span> — To hinder the guards from combining in carrying on any fraud. See <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a> : where we learn that a precaution of the like kind was made use of in the case of Daniel shut up in the lions’ den. “Thus, while the priests cautiously proposed to prevent our Lord’s resurrection from being palmed upon the world, resolving no doubt to show his body publicly after the third day, as a proof that he was an impostor, they put the truth of his resurrection beyond all question; for, besides that there could be no room for the least suspicion of deceit, when it should be found that his body was raised out of a new tomb, where there was no other corpse, and this tomb hewn out of a rock, the mouth of which was secured by a great stone, under a seal, and a guard of soldiers; by appointing this guard, they furnished a number of unexceptionable witnesses to it, whose testimony they themselves could not refuse. See <a href="/matthew/28-11.htm" title="Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done.">Matthew 28:11</a>.” “The chief priests and Pharisees,” says Bishop Porteus, “having taken these precautions, waited probably with no small impatience for the third day after the crucifixion — when they made no doubt they should find the body in the sepulchre, and convict Jesus of deceit and imposture.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:62-66 On the Jewish sabbath, the chief priests and Pharisees, when they should have been at their devotions, were dealing with Pilate about securing the sepulchre. This was permitted that there might be certain proof of our Lord's resurrection. Pilate told them that they might secure the sepulchre as carefully as they could. They sealed the stone, and set a guard, and were satisfied that all needful care was taken. But to guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples was folly, because needless; while to think to guard it against the power of God, was folly, because fruitless, and to no purpose; yet they thought they dealt wisely. But the Lord took the wise in their own craftiness.

The "next day" mentioned here does not mean the following day in our acceptation of the word, or the following "morning," but the next day in the Jewish way of speaking - that is, after the next day had commenced, or after sundown.

But Matthew had already spoken so definitely of the first day of the feast as that on which Jesus was crucified (see <a href="/matthew/24-17.htm" title="Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:">Matthew 24:17</a> to <a href="/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>), that he had no cause to apprehend any misunderstanding of his words had he chosen to write <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶ σάββατον</span>. But as little does that precise statement regarding the day permit us to suppose that the expression in question has been made to turn on the divergent narrative of John (in opposition to de Wette). The most natural explanation of the peculiar phraseology: <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶ μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρασκ</span>., is to be found in that <span class="ital">Christian</span> usage according to which the <span class="greekheb">παρασκεύη</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the <span class="greekheb">προσάββατον</span>, <a href="/mark/15-42.htm" title="And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,">Mark 15:42</a>) has come to be the recognised designation for the Friday of the crucifixion.

The transactions here recorded effectually dispose of that hypothesis by making theft impossible. Is the story true, or must we, with Meyer, relegate it to the category of unhistorical legend? Meyer founds largely on the impossibility of Christ predicting so distinctly as is here implied, even to His own disciples, His resurrection. That means that the priests and Pharisees could have had no such solicitude as is ascribed to them. All turns on that. If they had such fears, so originating, it would be quite natural to take precautions against a trick. I think it quite possible that even independently of the saying in chap. <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a>, given as spoken <span class="ital">to</span> Pharisees, it had somehow reached their ears that Jesus had predicted His Passion, and in speaking of it was wont to connect with it the idea of rising again, and it was natural that at such a time they should not despise such reports.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">62</span>. <span class="ital">the next day, that followed the day of the preparation</span>] It was after sunset on Nisan 14.

The present day was the 15th of Nisan, and both a sabbath and the chief day of the Passover festival. The term "preparation," or "prosabbath" (Judith 8:6), was applied by the Jews to the day preceding the sabbath or the chief festivals (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16:06. 2); but by the time the gospel was committed to writing, Paraskeue had become among Christians the usual designation of the day of Christ's death; hence the sabbath, which was of less importance than the crucifixion day, is here called, "the day after the Paraskeue." The language of the synoptists leads to the conclusion that the action of the Sanhedrists in applying to Pilate took place on the sabbath, their uneasy conscience and fear of some surprising event overcoming that scrupulous regard to the sanctity of the holy day which they would have strictly enforced upon others. It is just possible, however, that they postponed their application till the evening, having nothing to fear till "the third day." <span class="cmt_word">Came together unto Pilate;</span> <span class="accented">were gathered together.</span> A large deputation of the chief men presented itself before the procurator, anxious to obtain his aid to prevent all tampering with the buried body of Jesus, at the same time apprehending some event, they knew not what, which might tend to corroborate his claims. Neologians have argued against the credibility of this section of the gospel history, and have been followed by some commentators of greater faith. A refutation of the most prominent objections will be found in Alford's notes on ver. 62. </body></html>
