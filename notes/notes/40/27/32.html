Why, we ask, out of the whole crowd that was streaming to and fro, on the way to the place of execution, did the multitude seize on him? St. Mark’s mention of him as the father of Alexander and Rufus (see Note on <a href="/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>), suggests the thought that his sons were afterwards prominent as members of the Christian community. May we not infer that he was suspected even then of being a secret disciple, and that this led the people to seize on him, and make him a sharer in the humiliation of his Master? He was coming, St. Mark adds, “out of the country.”<p><span class= "bld">Him they compelled.</span>—The word is the technical term for forced service (see Note on <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>).

Even the mercies of the wicked are really cruel. Taking the cross from him, they compelled one Simon to bear it. Make us ready, O Lord, to bear the cross thou hast appointed us, and daily to take it up with cheerfulness, following thee. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? And when we behold what manner of death he died, let us in that behold with what manner of love he loved us. As if death, so painful a death, were not enough, they added to its bitterness and terror in several ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As they came out - That is, either out of the governor's palace where he had been treated with such cruelty and contempt, or out of the gates of the city, to crucify him.<p>A man of Cyrene - Cyrene was a city of Libya, in Africa, lying west of Egypt. There were many Jews there, and they were in the habit, like others, of going frequently to Jerusalem.<p>Him they compelled go bear his cross - John says <a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a> that Jesus went forth "bearing his cross." Luke says <a href="/luke/23-26.htm">Luke 23:26</a> that they laid the cross on Simon, that he might bear it after Jesus. There is no contradiction in these accounts. It was a part of the usual punishment of those who were crucified that they should bear their own cross to the place of execution. Accordingly, it was laid at first on Jesus, and he went forth, as John says, bearing it. Weak, however, and exhausted by suffering and watchfulness, he probably sunk under the heavy burden, and they laid hold of Simon that he might bear "one end" of the cross, as Luke says, "after Jesus." The cross was composed of two pieces of wood, one of which was placed upright in the earth, and the other crossed it after the form of the figure of a cross. The upright part was commonly so high that the feet of the person crucified were 2 or 3 feet from the ground.<p>On the middle of that upright part there was usually a projection or seat on which the person crucified sat, or, as it were, "rode." This was necessary, as the hands were not alone strong enough to bear the weight of the body; as the body was left exposed often many days, and not unfrequently suffered to remain till the flesh had been devoured by vultures or putrefied in the sun. The feet were fastened to this upright piece either by nailing them with large spikes driven through the tender part, or by being lashed by cords. To the cross-piece at the top, the hands, being extended, were also fastened, either by spikes or by cords, or perhaps, in some cases, by both. The hands and feet of our Saviour were both fastened by spikes. Crosses were also sometimes made in the form of the letter X, the limbs of the person crucified being extended to the four parts, and he suffered to die a lingering death in this cruel manner. The cross used in the Crucifixion of Christ appears to have been the former. The mention of the cross often occurs in the New Testament. It was the instrument on which the Saviour made atonement for the sins of the world. The whole of the Christian's hope of heaven, and all his peace and consolation in trial and in death, depend on the sacrifice there made for sin, and on just views and feelings in regard to the fact and the design of the Redeemer's death.

Of the city; for no execution was made, neither in the court of judicature, nor in the city, but at some distance; as it was at stoning, so at crucifixion (h): <p>"when judgment was finished, they brought him out to be stoned; the place of stoning was without the sanhedrim, as it is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>, "bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp". <p>Upon which the gloss and Gemara say (i), without the three camps; which were these, the court which was the camp of the Shekinah; or the divine presence; and the mountain of the house, the camp of the Levites; and the city, the camp of Israel; so that he that was executed, was had without the city. Maimonides (k) says, <p>"the place in which the sanhedrim executed, was without it, and at a distance from it, as it is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>, and it appears to me, that it was about six miles distant; for so far it was between the sanhedrim of Moses our master, which was before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the camp of Israel. <p>So Jesus went without the camp, and suffered without the gate, as the antitype of the red heifer; see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19-3.htm">Numbers 19:3</a>, compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11</a>, and the notes there, <p>They found a man of Cyrene: a place in Libya, and one of the five cities called Pentapolis: which were these, Berenice, Arsinoe, Ptolemais, Apollonia, and Cyrene (l); Kir in <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> is rendered by the Targum,  "Cyrene", as it is also by the Vulgate Latin. There were many Jews dwelt here, as appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>, as this man was a Jew, as his name shows; and besides, there was a synagogue of the Cyrenian Jews at Jerusalem, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>, so that though he was a native of Cyrene, he might now dwell there, and some of these were converted to the faith of Christ; for of those that were scattered abroad at the death of Stephen, some were men of Cyrene, <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>. And it is very likely, that this man was a favourer of Christ, which might be one reason why they laid hold on him, and obliged him to bear the cross of Christ; since he was the father of Alexander and Rufus, who were men of note among the first Christians: <p>Simon by name; of which name was one of the apostles, and a common name among the Jews, and signifies hearkening and obedient: and none are fit to bear, or will bear the cross of Christ, but such who hearken to his voice, and are obedient to him, being made willing in the day of his power: <p>him they compelled to bear his cross; which they did, not out of good will to Christ, but fearing lest through his faintness and weakness, he should, die before he got to the place of execution, and they be disappointed of their end, the crucifixion of him; or because they were in haste to have him executed, and he was not able to go so fast as they desired; for when they, first came out, the cross was laid upon Christ, and he bore it, as John relates; but he being weak and ready to faint under it, and not able to go the pace they would have him, and meeting with this man, they press him to bear it after him: which he might be unwilling to do, partly because it was scandalous and ignominious; and partly, because if a favourer of Jesus, he did not choose to be any ways accessary to his death: but he was obliged to it; and it may be observed from hence, that taking up the cross and following Christ, is disagreeable to flesh and blood: though the spirit may be willing, the flesh recoils; none care for it, or choose to bear it, unless constrained to it, <p>(h) Misn.

It was usual to compel the person who was to be executed to carry his <span class="ital">own</span> cross (see on <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>, and Keim, p. 397 f.);[34] to this the case of Jesus was no exception, <a href="/john/19-17.htm" title="And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:">John 19:17</a>. This statement of John does not exclude what is here said with regard to Simon and the cross, nor does it pretend to deny it (Keim), but it simply passes it over in silence, recording merely the main point in question,—the fact, namely, that Jesus had to carry His own cross (though there is nothing to prevent the supposition that He may have broken down under the burden before reaching the scene of the crucifixion).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That with such a large crowd following (<a href="/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27</a>) they should notwithstanding compel a foreigner who happened to be going toward the city (Mark, Luke) to carry the cross the rest of the way, is a circumstance sufficiently accounted for by the <span class="ital">infamy</span> that attached to that odious thing. Possibly Simon was a slave. To suppose that he was one of <span class="ital">Jesus’ followers</span>, and that <span class="ital">for this reason</span> he had been pressed into the service (Grotius, Kuinoel), is altogether arbitrary, for, according to the text, the determining circumstance lies in the fact that he was <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον Κυρηναῖον</span>. A foreigner coming from Cyrene would not be considered too respectable a person to be employed in such degrading work. That Simon, however, <span class="ital">became</span> a Christian, and that perhaps in consequence of his thus carrying the cross and being present at the crucifixion, is a legitimate inference from <a href="/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a> compared with <a href="/romans/16-13.htm" title="Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.">Romans 16:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἠγγάρ</span>.] See on <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] mentions the <span class="ital">object</span> for which this was done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] That is to say, the <span class="ital">post</span>, the <span class="ital">upright beam</span> of the cross, to which the transverse beam was not attached till the scene of the execution was reached, where the instrument of torture was duly put together and then set up with the criminal nailed to it. Hence (because <span class="greekheb">σταυρός</span> originally meant a, <span class="ital">post</span>) we find Greek authors making use of such expressions as <span class="greekheb">σταυρὸν φέρειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκφέρειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">βαστάζειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἴρειν</span>, comp. <span class="greekheb">σταυροφορεῖν</span>; Latin writers, however, with rather more regard for precision, distinguish between the <span class="ital">upright beam</span> which the criminal was called upon to <span class="ital">carry</span>, and the <span class="ital">crux</span> as it appeared when completed and <span class="ital">set up</span> at the place of execution. The <span class="ital">upright beam</span> which the cruciarius was compelled to drag after him was called <span class="ital">patibulum</span>; hence we never meet with the phrase <span class="ital">crucem ferre</span>, but always <span class="ital">patibulum</span> (the upright post) <span class="ital">ferre</span>, which patibulum was placed upon the poor criminal’s back, and with his outstretched hands securely tied to it, he had to balance it the best way he could upon his neck and shoulders. It is this distinction between <span class="ital">crux</span> and <span class="ital">patibulum</span> that enables us adequately to explain the well-known passages of Plautus: “Patibulum ferat per urbem, deinde affigatur cruci” (<span class="ital">ap. Non. Marcell</span>. 221), and “Dispensis manibus quom patibulum habebis” (<span class="ital">Mil. glor</span>. ii. 4. 7), and similarly with regard to expressions referring to the cross (as completed and set up): in crucem <span class="ital">tollere</span>, in crucem <span class="ital">agere</span> (Cicero and others), etc.; the comic expression <span class="ital">crucisalus</span> (Plaut. <span class="ital">Bacch</span>. ii. 3. 128); as also the passage in Tacit. <span class="ital">Ann</span>. xiv. 33, where the different modes of punishing by death are enumerated, beginning with those of a general nature and ending with the more specific: “Caedes, <span class="ital">patibula</span> (beams for penal purposes generally), ignes, <span class="ital">cruces</span>.” From this it is manifest at once that it would be incorrect to suppose, with Keim, that all that Christ had to carry was the <span class="ital">cross-beam</span>. Such a view is at variance both with the language of our text: <span class="greekheb">τὸν σταυρὸν αἴρειν</span>, and with the Latin phrase: <span class="ital">patibulum</span> ferre. So much is the <span class="ital">patibulum</span> regarded as the main portion of the cross, that in poetry it is sometimes used as equivalent to <span class="ital">crux</span>, as in Prudent. <span class="ital">Peristeph</span>. ix. 641: “Crux illa nostra est, nos patibulum ascendimus.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/27.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross....">Matthew 27:32-38</a>. <span class="ital">Crucifixion</span> (<a href="/context/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross....">Mark 15:21-27</a>; <a href="/luke/23-26.htm" title="And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.">Luke 23:26</a>; <a href="/context/luke/23-35.htm" title="And the people stood beholding.

Cyrene was a district in the north of Africa, under Roman rule, and colonized by a large number of Jews (Josephus, 'Cont. Apion.,' 2:4; 'Ant.,' 14:07. 2), who had a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>). Simon doubtless became a follower of Christ, and St. Mark mentions his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, as well known believers (see <a href="/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>). Probably the guards saw in him some tokens of sympathy with Christ and compassion for his sufferings; or they used his services simply as being a foreigner, and not likely to resent being put to a task which a Hebrew would deem the lowest degradation. <span class="cmt_word">Him</span> <span class="cmt_word">they compelled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">impressed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to bear his cross.</span> The verb translated "compelled" is derived from the Persian, and implies the compulsory power possessed by couriers of requisitioning horses and carriages in forwarding despatches (see <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>). The cross was probably the ordinary Latin cross, <span class="accented">crux immissa</span>, of which, however, the lower limb below the transom was longer than the upper; and this latter afforded a place where could be affixed the board containing the inscription. It was not as tall as usually represented; we are told that beasts of prey were able to gnaw the bodies hung thereon. In fact, the culprit's feet were only just raised above the ground, being drawn up till the soles lay flat on the upright beam. Nails were driven through the hands and feet, and the body was supported partly by these, and partly by a projecting pin of wood called the seat. The rest for the feet, often seen in pictures, was never used. A slight covering was allowed for decency's sake, the rest of the body being stripped of clothing; and thus the condemned, exposed to scorching sun, bleeding from the cruel scourge, suffering untold agonies, was left to die. Whether Jesus carried the whole cross or only the transom is uncertain. It is possible that the two were tied together by a rope at one end, so as to form an inverted V, and fastened in the proper position at the place of execution. However this may he, it proved too heavy a burden for him to bear. Spent with his long vigil and lack of food, his spirit afflicted by the agony in the garden and the unknown sufferings then and afterwards, his body tortured with open wounds and weakened with loss of blood, he sank beneath the weight, as he staggered weariedly along the rough and hilly streets, Either from a momentary compunction, or more probably flora impatience at the slowness of the poor Sufferer's movements, the soldiers gladly seized on Simon to relieve the Prisoner of the cross, or to share its weight, and thus enable them sooner to complete their cruel task. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Compelled to go (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>.
