The fact that the release of criminals was a common incident of a Latin <span class= "ital">lectisternium,</span> or feast in honour of the gods, makes the latter the more probable. If introduced by Pilate (and this is the only recorded instance of the practice) it was, we may believe, a concession intended to conciliate those whom his previous severities had alienated. Before this stage of the proceedings we have to place (1) the second conference between Pilate and the priests after his dialogue with our Lord (<a href="/context/luke/23-4.htm" title="Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.">Luke 23:4-5</a>), and their definite charge of sedition, now urged for the first time; and (2) his attempt, catching at the word “Galilee” as the scene of our Lord’s work, to transfer the responsibility of judging to Herod (<a href="/context/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would....">Matthew 27:15-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now at that feast, </span>&c. — It had become a custom with the Roman governors, at the feast of the passover, to gratify the people with the pardon and release of any one prisoner they pleased. There was no law to oblige them to do this, nor is it certain when or how this custom arose. But as acts of grace are generally popular things, it is probable it originated with the Romans themselves, and that they introduced and continued it to please their tributaries. It was, however, a bad custom, being an encouragement to wickedness, and an obstruction to justice. <span class="ital">And they had then a notable, </span><span class="greekheb">επισημον</span>, <span class="ital">a remarkable, </span>or <span class="ital">notorious prisoner </span>— Who had really been guilty of the crime whereof they falsely accused Jesus; had made an insurrection, with accomplices, and committed murder in the insurrection; a crime which, though their impudence exceeded all bounds, they durst not lay to Christ’s charge. <span class="ital">When they were gathered together </span>— About Pilate’s tribunal, and began with great noise and clamour to demand of him <span class="ital">that he would do, </span>at this passover, <span class="ital">as he had always done </span>upon the like occasion, <a href="/mark/15-8.htm" title="And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.">Mark 15:8</a>; and would discharge a prisoner, Pilate asked, <span class="ital">Whom will ye that I release unto you?

The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it.

Any little indulgence granted to the Jews during the heavy oppression of the Romans would serve to conciliate their favor, and to keep the nation from sedition. It might happen often that when persons were arraigned before the Romans on charge of sedition, some special favorite of the people, or some leader, might be among the number. It is evident that if they had the privilege of recovering such a person, it would serve much to allay their feelings, and make tolerable the yoke under which they groaned.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 27:11-26.

The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "at every feast": which looks as if the authors of these versions thought the sense was, that the following custom was used at each feast in the year, at the feasts of pentecost, and tabernacles, and passover; whereas it was only at the feast of the passover; and which is meant by the feast here, as is clear from <a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a>. It was but once a year that this was done; at every returning passover; and so the Persic version renders it, "every year on the day of the feast"; that is, of the passover, and which was frequently called by way of emphasis,  "the feast": <p>the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. It was not a law, but a custom; it was not enjoined by the law of Moses; for they that sinned against that; died without mercy: nor is it agreeable to strict justice, that there should be such a release of criminals; nor was it a Jewish custom, as an emblem of their deliverance out of Egyptian bondage. I have not met with the least trace of any such custom of theirs at the time of the pass over in any of their writings; but it seems to be a Roman one: and from all the accounts of the evangelist, it appears to be peculiar to the Roman governor, who, either by the order of Caesar, or of himself, introduced such a custom to get the favour of the people; for it was to them the release was made, and the person, whom they pleased; and this being repeated annually for some time, was expected by them, and at last became necessary. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Now at <i>that</i> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</span><p>(3) Christ is first acquitted by the same judge who condemns him, that we might see how the just dies for the unjust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/27.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.">Matthew 27:15</a> <span class="greekheb">Κατὰ ἑορτήν</span>] <span class="ital">on the occasion of the feast</span>, i.e. during the feast-time (Kühner, II. 1, p. 412; Winer, p. 374 [E.

But the release of prisoners was usual at certain festivals at Rome, and at Athens during the Panathenaic festival prisoners enjoyed temporary liberty. It is not, therefore, improbable that Herod the Great, who certainly familiarised the Jews with other usages of Greece and Rome, introduced this custom, and that the Roman governor, finding the custom established and gratifying to the Jews, in accordance with Roman practice (see Introd. p. 22 (3)) retained the observance of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.">Matthew 27:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">But at the feast</span>, etc.) This [custom of releasing a prisoner at the Feast] accorded with the deliverance from Egypt.—<span class="greekheb">ἑορτὴν</span>, <span class="ital">feast</span>) St John calls it expressly the Passover.—<span class="greekheb">εἰώθει</span>, <span class="ital">had been wont</span>) Even political customs subserve Divine Providence.—<span class="greekheb">ἓνα</span>, <span class="ital">one) i.e.</span>, one, and not more than one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-26.</span> - <span class="accented">Barabbas preferred to Jesus.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6-15</a>; <a href="/luke/23-17.htm">Luke 23:17-25</a>; <a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39, 40</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Pilate now tries another expedient for delivering himself from the responsibility of condemning Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">At that feast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">at a feast</span>, at feast time).
