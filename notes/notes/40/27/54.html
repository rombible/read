We must interpret them from the stand-point of the centurion’s knowledge, not from that of Christian faith, and to him the words “Son of God” would convey the idea of one who was God-like in those elements of character which are most divine—righteousness, and holiness, and love. The form of expression was naturally determined by the words which he had heard bandied to and fro as a taunt (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a>); and the centurion felt that the words, as he understood them, were true, and not false, of the Sufferer whose death he had witnessed. That the words might have such a sense in the lips even of a devout Jew, we find in the language of a book probably contemporary, and possibly written with some remote reference to our Lord’s death—the so-called <span class= "ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> (Wisd. ii. 13, 16-18). In the last of these verses, it will be noted, the terms “just man” and “son of God” appear as interchangeable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/27-54.htm" title="Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.">Matthew 27:54</a></span>. <span class="ital">When the centurion </span>— The officer who commanded the guard, called <span class="ital">centurio, </span>from <span class="ital">centum, </span>a hundred, because he had the command of a hundred men; <span class="ital">and those that were with him </span>— The soldiers that attended him; <span class="ital">watching Jesus </span>— And standing over against him; <span class="ital">saw the earthquake, and the things that were done </span>— The other wonders wrought at his crucifixion, together with his meek and patient behaviour under his sufferings, and the composure and confidence with which he committed his departing soul into the hands of his heavenly Father; <span class="ital">they feared greatly </span>— Were greatly alarmed and influenced by a religious fear of that Being who had given such awful proofs of his displeasure at what had just taken place. Luke says, <span class="ital">The centurion glorified God, </span>and that not only by acknowledging his hand in the prodigies they had witnessed, but by confessing the innocence of Jesus, <span class="ital">saying, Certainly this was a righteous man </span>— Gr. <span class="greekheb">δικαιος</span>, the character which Pilate’s wife had given of him before he was condemned, <a href="/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>. According to Mark, chap. <a href="/matthew/15-39.htm" title="And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.">Matthew 15:39</a>, he said likewise, <span class="ital">Truly this man was the Son of God. </span>It is true, because the article is here wanting in the original, and the words, both in Matthew and. Mark, are only <span class="greekheb">υιος θεου</span>, and not <span class="greekheb">ο υιος του θεου</span>, some would render the expression, <span class="ital">a son of God; </span>a phraseology which they think perfectly suitable in the mouth of a polytheist and an idolater, such as they take it for granted this Roman centurion was. But it is evident that no argument can be brought in justification of such a sense of the words from the absence of the Greek article, because it is often wanting when the true God is evidently meant, as <a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a>, and <a href="/john/19-7.htm" title="The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.">John 19:7</a>. It is probable this centurion was not now an idolater, but a proselyte to the Jewish religion, and therefore a worshipper of the true God. At least he must have been acquainted with the opinions of the Jews, and have known that Jesus was put to death by them for averring himself to be, not <span class="ital">the son of a </span>heathen <span class="ital">god, </span>but the son of the God whom the Jews worshipped: and therefore, when he made his confession, he doubtless referred to that circumstance, or to the words of the chief priests and scribes, recorded in <a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a>, <span class="ital">He trusted in God, &c., for he said, I am the Son of God. </span>Matthew says, They that were with the centurion joined in the same confession. It maybe questioned, indeed, as they seem to have been the same soldiers that crowned Jesus with thorns and mocked him, whether they understood the proper meaning of the expression, <span class="ital">The Son of God. </span>They probably, however, were convinced that he was a person approved of, and beloved by, the God of the Jews; and that his heavenly Father would certainly avenge his quarrel very terribly on them, and on the Jewish nation, who had delivered him into their hands to be crucified. In the mean time, though the Roman centurion, and his heathen soldiers, were thus alarmed by the prodigies which they had beheld, these wonders appear to have had no influence on the minds of the Jewish priests, scribes, and elders: their minds, it seems, continued impenetrable and obstinate, and full of unbelief and invincible prejudice against Christ, so that neither the miracles done by him in his life, nor those wrought at his death, could convince them that he was any other than an impostor and deceiver. This, however, was not the case with the common people. From <a href="/luke/23-48.htm" title="And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.">Luke 23:48</a>, we learn that not only the centurion and his soldiers, but <span class="ital">all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, </span>for sorrow and remorse; in terrible expectation that some sad calamity would speedily befall them and their country, for the indignities and cruelties they had offered to a person for whom God had expressed so high a regard, even in his greatest distress. “They had, indeed, been instant with loud voices to have him crucified, but now that they saw the face of the creation darkened with a sullen gloom during his crucifixion, and found his death accompanied with an earthquake, as if nature had been in an agony when he died, they rightly interpreted these prodigies to be so many testimonies of his innocence; and their passions, which had been inflamed and exasperated against him, became quite calm, or moved in his behalf. Some could not forgive themselves for neglecting to accept his life when the governor offered to release him; others were stung with remorse for having had an active hand both in his death, and in the insults that were offered to him; others felt the deepest grief at the thought of his lot, which was undeservedly severe; and these various passions appeared in their countenances, for they came away from the cruel execution pensive and silent, with downcast eyes, and hearts ready to burst: or groaning deeply within themselves, they wept, smote their breasts, and wailed greatly. The grief which they now felt for Jesus, was distinguished from their former rage against him by this remarkable character, that their rage was entirely produced by the craft of the priests, who had wickedly incensed them; whereas their grief was the genuine feeling of their own hearts, greatly affected with the truth and innocence of him that was the object of their commiseration. Nor was this the temper only of a few, who may be thought to have been Christ’s particular friends. It was the general condition of the people, who had come in such numbers to look on, that when they parted, after the execution, they covered the roads, and, as it were, darkened the whole fields around.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:51-56 The rending of the veil signified that Christ, by his death, opened a way to God. We have an open way through Christ to the throne of grace, or mercy-seat now, and to the throne of glory hereafter. When we duly consider Christ's death, our hard and rocky hearts should be rent; the heart, and not the garments. That heart is harder than a rock that will not yield, that will not melt, where Jesus Christ is plainly set forth crucified. The graves were opened, and many bodies of saints which slept, arose. To whom they appeared, in what manner, and how they disappeared, we are not told; and we must not desire to be wise above what is written. The dreadful appearances of God in his providence, sometimes work strangely for the conviction and awakening of sinners. This was expressed in the terror that fell upon the centurion and the Roman soldiers. We may reflect with comfort on the abundant testimonies given to the character of Jesus; and, seeking to give no just cause of offence, we may leave it to the Lord to clear our characters, if we live to Him. Let us, with an eye of faith, behold Christ and him crucified, and be affected with that great love wherewith he loved us. But his friends could give no more than a look; they beheld him, but could not help him. Never were the horrid nature and effects of sin so tremendously displayed, as on that day when the beloved Son of the Father hung upon the cross, suffering for sin, the Just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Let us yield ourselves willingly to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now when the centurion ... - Centurion, a captain of a hundred soldiers.

The centurion was a pagan, and had probably no very distinct notions of the phrase "the Son of God" - perhaps understanding by it only that he was like the pagan heroes who had been deified; but he certainly regarded these wonders as proof that he was "what he professed to be." In the original it is "a son of a god;" an expression perfectly suitable to a polytheist, who believed in the existence of many gods. Mark Mar 15:39 says that they affirmed that "this man was the Son of God." Luke Luk 23:47, that they said, "Certainly this was a righteous man.' These things were said by "different persons," or at different periods of his sufferings - one evangelist having recorded one saying, and another another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>54.

St. Matthew relates the impression which these events made upon the soldiers' minds. <span class="cmt_word">Saw those things that were done.</span> Instead of this reading, which has high authority, Alford, Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort read, "that were being done," as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae fiebant.</span> This would point especially to the loud cry, in accordance with the words of St. Mark, "saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost." But there is no sufficient reason for altering the Received Text; and plainly it was not merely the closing incident that affected the soldiers, but the whole course of events which they witnessed. They saw the darkness, the earthquake, the rending of the rocks, the Divine meekness of the Sufferer; they heard his last words, his loud cry, and marked his patient death. All these things contributed to their awe and fear. <span class="cmt_word">They feared greatly</span>. This crucified Man must be something more than human, for all these wonders to accompany his death: will he not visit upon us our part in his crucifixion? Have we nothing to fear from his vengeance?

They recognized his innocence, and acknowledged that he suffered unjustly. What the centurion meant (for the words appear to have been his) by calling him "Son of God" is more doubtful. It may have been on his lips merely an affirmation that Jesus was holy and beloved by God; but more probably it meant much more than this. He knew that Christ claimed to be the Son of God, and in this hour of overwhelming awe he felt that the claim was just, whatever it might mean. This crucified Person was at least a hero or a demigod, or that which the words would imply in a Jewish sense, though he knew only imperfectly what was signified thereby. Tradition affirms that the centurion's name was Longinus, that he became a devoted follower of Christ, preached the faith, and died a martyr's death. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Son of God.
