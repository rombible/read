The name Bar-abbas (=son of Abbas, or of “a father”), like Bar-timseus and Bartholomew, was a patronymic, and it would be natural enough that the man who bore it should have another more personal name. We can easily understand (1) that the commonness of the name Jesus might lead to his being known to his comrades and to the multitude only or chiefly as Barabbas; and (2) that the reverence which men felt in after years for the Name which is above every name, would lead them to blot out, if it were possible, the traces that it had once been borne by the robber-chief. Of Barabbas St. John (<a href="/john/18-40.htm" title="Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.">John 18:40</a>) tells us that he was a robber; St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-19.htm" title="(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)">Luke 23:19</a>) and St. Mark (<a href="/mark/15-7.htm" title="And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.">Mark 15:7</a>) that he had taken a prominent part with some insurgents in the city, and that he, with them, had committed murder in the insurrection. The last recorded tumult of this kind was that mentioned above (Note on <a href="/matthew/27-2.htm" title="And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.">Matthew 27:2</a>), as connected with Pilate’s appropriation of the Corban. It is so far probable that this was the tumult in which Barabbas had taken part; and the supposition that he did so has at least the merit of explaining how it was that he came to be the favourite hero both of the priests and people. As the term Abba (=father) was a customary term of honour, as applied to a Rabbi (<a href="/matthew/23-9.htm" title="And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.">Matthew 23:9</a>), it is possible that the sobriquet by which he was popularly known commemorated a fact in his family history of which he might naturally be proud. “Jesus, the Rabbi’s son “was a cry that found more favour than “Jesus the Nazarene.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:11-25 Having no malice against Jesus, Pilate urged him to clear himself, and laboured to get him discharged. The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it.

The Vulgate Latin reads, "he had"; that is, Pilate, who had committed him to prison, and under whose power he was: for the Jews had lost all authority of this kind, at least in capital cases. This prisoner is called a "notable" one; that is, a famous, or rather an infamous one: he was a thief, and a robber, and had been guilty of sedition; had made, or joined with others in an insurrection, and had committed murder in it; and so, on more accounts than one, was deserving of death: nor could it be otherwise expected by himself, or others, but that he should die: his name was <p>called Barabbas; that is, as the Syriac version reads it, , which signifies "the son of a father": a father's child that was spoiled and ruined, and a child of his father the devil. This was a name common among the Jews. Frequent mention is made of R. Abba (h), and Bar Abba is the son of Abba: hence we read of Abba Bar Abba (i), and of R. Samuel Bar Abba (k) and of R. Simeon Bar Abba (l), and of R. Chijah Bar Abba (m). In Munster's Hebrew Gospel it is read  "Bar Rabbah, the son of a master"; and so Jerom says, that in the Gospel according to the Hebrews it is interpreted, "the son of their master"; but the former is the right name, and the true sense of the word. The Ethiopic version adds, "the prince", or "chief of robbers, and all knew him"; and the Arabic, instead of a "prisoner", reads, a "thief", as he was. <p>(h) Juchasin, fol. 70. 1, &amp;c. (i) T.

For the baser the criminal, the less would Pilate expect them to demand his release. “But they would sooner have asked the devil himself to be liberated,” Luther’s gloss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/27.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-16.htm" title="And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.">Matthew 27:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἶχον</span>: they, the people (<span class="greekheb">ὄχλῳ</span>, <a href="/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.">Matthew 27:15</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐπίσημον</span>: pointing not to the magnitude of his crime, but to the fact that for some reason or other he was an object of popular interest.—<span class="greekheb">Βαραββᾶν</span>, accusative of <span class="greekheb">Βαραββᾶς</span> = son of a father, or with double <span class="greekheb">ρ</span>, and retaining the <span class="ital">v</span> at the end, Bar-Rabban = son of a Rabbi.

It is a strange fact that in some (not very trustworthy) manuscripts the name is given as Jesus Barabbas, which affords a remarkable antithesis in Pilate's question in the following verse, "Wilt ye that I release Jesus Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?" There can be no reasonable doubt that the prefix is not genuine, but has crept into some texts inadvertently. </body></html>
