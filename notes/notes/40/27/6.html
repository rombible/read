We see these priests and rulers had a conscience too! but what kind of a conscience! A conscience that strained out a gnat and swallowed a camel! They scrupled deviating from a ceremonial direction of Moses, while they were knowingly and wilfully transgressing, in the most flagrant instance possible, the eternal and unchangeable laws of justice and mercy! were adjudging to an ignominious and painful death <span class="ital">the Holy One of God! </span>These “arch hypocrites,” says Baxter, “make conscience of ceremony, and make no conscience of perjury, persecution, and murdering the innocent! Blood they thirst for, and will give money to procure it, but the price of blood must not be consecrated!” They scruple not to give money to procure the shedding of blood, but scruple the putting that money into the treasury! they are afraid to defile the treasury, but not afraid to pollute their souls. The word <span class="greekheb">κορβαναν</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">treasury, </span>occurs in no other passage in the Scriptures. Josephus makes use of it, and interprets it, <span class="greekheb">τον ιερον θησαυρον</span>, <span class="ital">the sacred treasure. </span>It is formed from <span class="greekheb">κορβαν</span>, originally Hebrew, which also occurs but once in the Greek form, namely, <a href="/mark/7-11.htm" title="But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me; he shall be free.">Mark 7:11</a>, and signifies <span class="ital">that which is given, </span>or <span class="ital">devoted to God. </span>The unlawfulness of putting the thirty shekels into this repository arose from this single circumstance, that it contained the treasure consecrated to God; and the priests judged that such an offering, as this price of blood, would have been as much an abomination to the Lord, as the <span class="ital">hire of a whore, </span>or <span class="ital">the price of a dog, </span>which were expressly forbidden to be brought into the house of God for any vow, or offering, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm" title="You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>. <span class="ital">They took counsel and bought the potter’s field </span>— Well known, it seems, by that name; <span class="ital">to bury strangers in </span>— Foreigners, heathen, especially, of whom there then were great numbers at Jerusalem. To purchase this field with the money, they thought would be putting it to a pious use; so holy and charitable would they be! Perhaps they thought to atone for what they had done by this public good act of providing a <span class="ital">burying-place for strangers, </span>though not at their own charge! Thus, in the dark times of Popery, people were made to believe that building churches, and endowing monasteries, would make amends for immoralities. <span class="ital">Thirty pieces of silver </span>may seem but a small price for a field so near to Jerusalem as this was. Probably the potters, by digging earth out of it for their ware, had made it useless either for tillage or pasture. <span class="ital">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood</span> — Because it was bought with the money Judas received for betraying his Master’s life. Providence seems to have set this name upon the field to perpetuate the memory of the transaction. Jerome, who had been upon the spot, tells us that they still showed this field in his time: that it lay south of mount Zion, and that they buried there the poorest and meanest of the people. The historian’s mentioning the purchase of the potter’s field with the money for which Judas betrayed his Master, being an appeal to a very public transaction, puts the truth of this part of the history beyond all manner of exception.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 Wicked men see little of the consequences of their crimes when they commit them, but they must answer for them all. In the fullest manner Judas acknowledged to the chief priests that he had sinned, and betrayed an innocent person. This was full testimony to the character of Christ; but the rulers were hardened. Casting down the money, Judas departed, and went and hanged himself, not being able to bear the terror of Divine wrath, and the anguish of despair. There is little doubt but that the death of Judas was before that of our blessed Lord. But was it nothing to them that they had thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had condemned it to be shed unjustly? Thus do fools make a mock at sin. Thus many make light of Christ crucified. And it is a common instance of the deceitfulness of our hearts, to make light of our own sin by dwelling upon other people's sins. But the judgment of God is according to truth. Many apply this passage of the buying the piece of ground, with the money Judas brought back, to signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ to strangers, and sinners of the Gentiles. It fulfilled a prophecy, Zec 11:12. Judas went far toward repentance, yet it was not to salvation. He confessed, but not to God; he did not go to him, and say, I have sinned, Father, against heaven. Let none be satisfied with such partial convictions as a man may have, and yet remain full of pride, enmity, and rebellion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is not lawful ... - It was forbidden <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a> to take what was esteemed as an abomination and to offer it to God. The price of blood - that is, of the life of a man - they justly considered as an improper and unlawful offering.<p>The treasury - The "treasury" was kept in the court of the women. See plan of the temple, <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. It was composed of a number of small "chests" placed in different parts of the "courts" to receive the voluntary offerings of the people, as well as the half shekel required of every Jew. The original word rendered here as "treasury" contains the notion of an "offering to God." What was given there was considered as an offering made to him.<p>The price of blood - The life is in the "blood." See the notes at <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>. The word "blood" here means the same as "life." The price of blood means the price by which the life of a man has been purchased. This was an acknowledgment that in their view Jesus was innocent. They had bought him, not condemned him justly. It is remarkable that they were so scrupulous now about so small a matter, comparatively, as putting this money in the treasury, when they had no remorse about "murdering an innocent" man, and crucifying him who had given full evidence that he was the Messiah. People are often very scrupulous in "small" matters, who stick not at great crimes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.
