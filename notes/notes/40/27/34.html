lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>. It was clearly something at once nauseous and narcotic, given by the merciful to dull the pain of execution, and mixed with the sour wine of the country and with myrrh to make it drinkable. It may have been hemlock, or even poppy-juice, but there are no materials for deciding. It is probable that the offer came from the more pitiful of the women mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27</a>) as following our Lord and lamenting. Such acts were among the received “works of mercy” of the time and place. The “tasting” implied a recognition of the kindly purpose of the act, but a recognition only. In the refusal to do more than taste we trace the resolute purpose to drink the cup which His Father had given Him to the last drop, and not to dull either the sense of suffering nor the clearness of His communion with His Father with the slumberous potion. The same draught was, we may believe, offered to the two criminals who were crucified with Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:31-34 Christ was led as a Lamb to the slaughter, as a Sacrifice to the altar. Even the mercies of the wicked are really cruel. Taking the cross from him, they compelled one Simon to bear it. Make us ready, O Lord, to bear the cross thou hast appointed us, and daily to take it up with cheerfulness, following thee. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? And when we behold what manner of death he died, let us in that behold with what manner of love he loved us. As if death, so painful a death, were not enough, they added to its bitterness and terror in several ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave him vinegar ... - Mark says that, "they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh." The two evangelists mean the same thing. Vinegar was made of light wine rendered acid, and was the common drink of the Roman soldiers, and this might be called either vinegar or wine in common language. "Myrrh" is a bitter substance produced in Arabia, but is used often to denote anything bitter. The meaning of the name is "bitterness." See the notes at <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>. "Gall" is properly a bitter secretion from the liver, but the word is also used to denote anything exceedingly "bitter," as wormwood, etc. The drink, therefore, was vinegar or sour wine, rendered "bitter" by the infusion of wormwood or some other very bitter substance. The effect of this, it is said, was to stupefy the senses. It was often given to those who were crucified, to render them insensible to the pains of death. Our Lord, knowing this, when he bad tasted it refused to drink. He was unwilling to blunt the pains of dying. The "cup" which his "Father" gave him he rather chose to drink. He came to suffer. His sorrows were necessary for the work of the atonement, and he gave himself up to the unmitigated sufferings of the cross. This was presented to him in the early part of his sufferings, or when he was about to be suspended on the cross. "Afterward," when he was on the cross and just before his death, vinegar was offered to him "without the myrrh" - the vinegar which the soldiers usually drank - and of this he drank. See <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-49.htm">Matthew 27:49</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28-30</a>. When Matthew and Mark say that he "would not drink," they refer to a different thing and a different time from John, and there is no contradiction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 27:34-50.

But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

John saith, that he himself bare it. Both were doubtless true. Some say that Christ himself did carry it through the city, and when he was out of the city this Simon carried it. Others think, that Christ being wearied, Simon took it. But reason will tell us, that the cross was too heavy a piece of timber for one to bear, and therefore Simon was compelled to bear the hinder part; therefore Luke saith, he bare it after Jesus. The dispute whether this Simon was a native Jew, though an inhabitant of Cyrene, or a proselyted Cyrenian, or as yet a pagan, and whether this Cyrene was one of the ten cities comprehended in the name Decapolis, is not worth spending any words about. All the evangelists agree, that he was crucified at <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Golgotha; </span> Luke calls it Calvary; they are both names of the same signification, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the place of a skull; </span> the one is the Hebrew term, the other Latin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall.</span> Mark saith, <span class="ital">wine mingled with myrrh.</span> There is so great a cognation between wine and vinegar, that it is no wonder if one evangelist calls it vinegar, another wine, which, if it be acid, is vinegar. The word translated <span class="ital">gall</span> signifies all bitterness, whether it be caused from gall or myrrh. Some think that some good people gave him wine, and the soldiers added myrrh to it. But this is a great uncertainty. Certain it is, that it was an ordinary favour they showed to dying persons, to give them some intoxicating potion, to make them less sensible of their pain. It is probable it was something of this nature; but our Saviour was not afraid to die, and so had no need of such an antidote against the pain of it; he refused it. We shall find they afterward gave him something to drink also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Luke tells us that great multitudes followed him to the place of execution, (which is still very ordinary), lamenting him, to whom our Saviour saith, <span class="ital">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children; </span> and then prophesieth the miseries that should follow his death, to that degree, that the barren should bless themselves; and they all should <span class="ital">say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us.</span> He bids the women weep only for themselves and for their children; for how much better is it for persons of any tenderness to have no children, than to have children, and to see them dashed against the stones, as was threatened to Babylon, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/137-9.htm" title="Happy shall he be, that takes and dashes your little ones against the stones.">Psalm 137:9</a></span>; or to kill them for the parents’ sustenance, as it happened in Ahab’s time; or to see them slain before the parents’ faces, as it happened to Zedekiah, when the enemy took Jerusalem! <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/52-10.htm" title="And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.">Jeremiah 52:10</a></span>.

It was a custom with the Jews (o) when <p>"a man went out to be executed, to give him to drink a grain of frankincense in a cup of wine, that his understanding might be disturbed, as it is said, <a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>. "Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts"; and the tradition is, that the honourable women in Jerusalem gave this freely; but if they did not, it was provided at the charge of the congregation. <p>The design of it was to cheer their spirits, and intoxicate their heads, that they might not be sensible of their pain and misery. But such a cup was not allowed Christ at the public expense, nor were the honourable women so compassionate to him; or if it was sent him, the soldiers did not give it him, but another potion in the room of it; indeed Mark says, they gave him "wine mingled with myrrh", <p><a href="/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>; which was either a cordial provided by his friends, and given him, and is different from what the soldiers gave him here; or the sense is, that they gave him the cup, that was so called, but not the thing; but instead of it, <p>vinegar mingled with gall. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, instead of "vinegar", read "wine"; and so does Munster's Hebrew Gospel, and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy, and in another exemplar, and in one of Stephens's; and which may be easily reconciled with the common reading, and that with Mark; for the wine they gave him was flat and sour, and no other or better than vinegar; and real vinegar may be so called, as this seems to be; and the rather, because vinegar was a part of the Roman soldiers' allowance, and so they had it ready at hand; See Gill on <a href="/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>. As also, because it was thought that vinegar was useful to prolong the life of a man ready to die; and therefore they might choose to give it to Christ, that he might live the longer in misery: so the Jews (p) write, that "if a man swallows a wasp or hornet alive, he cannot live; but they must give him to drink a quarter, , "of vinegar of Shamgaz", (which the gloss says is strong vinegar,) and it is possible he may live a little while, until he hath given orders to his house. <p>The Arabic version, instead of "gall", reads "myrrh"; nor are we to suppose that this drink was mixed with the gall of a beast itself, but with something that was as bitter as "gall"; as wormwood, or myrrh, or any other bitter, to make it distasteful. This potion of vinegar with gall, was an aggravating circumstance in our Lord's sufferings, being given to him when he had a violent thirst upon him; and was an emblem of the bitter cup of God's wrath, he had already tasted of in the garden, and was about to drink up: the Jews had a notion of vinegar's being expressive of the chastisements of the Messiah; the words in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>, they say (q), <p>"speak of the king Messiah; "come thou hither", draw nigh to the kingdom; "and eat of the bread", this is the bread of the kingdom, "and dip thy morsel in the vinegar", <p>, "these are the chastisements", as it is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "he was wounded for our transgressions". <p>By this offer was fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, and which he did not altogether refuse; for it follows, <p>and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink: not because it was the vinegar of Gentiles, which was forbidden by the Jewish canons (q), lest it should have been offered to idols; but because he would make use of no means either to prolong his life, or discompose his mind; and that it might appear he knew what he did, and that he was not afraid nor unwilling to die; though he thought fit to taste of it in a superficial way, to show he did not despise nor resent their offer; and that he was really athirst, and ready to drink a more disagreeable potion than that, <p>(o) T.

This drink consisted of <span class="ital">wine</span> (see the critical remarks) mixed with <span class="ital">gall</span>, according to Matthew; with <span class="ital">myrrh</span>, according to Mark. <span class="greekheb">χολή</span> admits of no other meaning than that of <span class="ital">gall</span>, and on no account must it be made to bear the sense of myrrh or wormwood[36] (Beza, Grotius, Paulus, Langen, Steinmeyer, Keim). The tradition about the <span class="ital">gall</span>, which unquestionably belongs to a later period, originated in the LXX. rendering of <a href="/psalms/68-23.htm" title="That your foot may be dipped in the blood of your enemies, and the tongue of your dogs in the same.">Psalm 68:23</a>; people wished to make out that there was <span class="ital">maltreatment</span> in the very drink that was offered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΕΥΣΆΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>] According to Matthew, then, Jesus rejected the potion because the taste of gall made it undrinkable. A later view than that embodied in <a href="/mark/15-23.htm" title="And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.">Mark 15:23</a>, from which passage it would appear that Jesus does not even taste the drink, but declines it altogether, because He has no desire to be stupefied before death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] No doubt the LXX. translate לַעֲנָה, wormwood, by <span class="greekheb">χολή</span> (<a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm" title="But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.">Proverbs 5:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm" title="He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with wormwood.">Lamentations 3:15</a>); but in those passages they took it as meaning literal “gall,” just as in the case of <a href="/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.">Psalm 69:22</a>, which regulates the sense of our present passage, they also understood gall to be meant, although the word in the original is רֹאשׁ (poison). Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm" title="Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defended cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-17.htm" title="And you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>. A usage so entirely foreign to the Greek tongue certainly cannot be justified on the ground of one or two passages, like these from the Septuagint. Had “bitter spiced wine” (Steinmeyer) been what Matthew intended, he would have had no more difficulty in expressing this than Mark himself. But the idea he wished to convey was that of wine along with gall, in fact mixed with it, and this idea he expresses as plain as words can speak it. Comp. Barnab. 7 : <span class="greekheb">σταυρωθεὶς ἐποτίζετο ὂξει καὶ χκολῇ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/27.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἶνον μετὰ χολῆς μ</span>., wine mingled with gall. Mk. has <span class="greekheb">ἐσμυρνισμένον οἶν</span>., wine drugged with myrrh, a drink given by a merciful custom before execution to deaden the sense of pain. The wine would be the sour wine or <span class="ital">posca</span> used by Roman soldiers. In Mk. Jesus declines the drink, apparently without tasting, desiring to suffer with clear mind. In Mt. He tastes (<span class="greekheb">γευσάμενος</span>) and then declines, apparently because unpalatable, suggesting a different motive in the offerers, not mercy but cruelty; maltreatment in the very drink offered. To this view of the proceeding is ascribed the <span class="greekheb">μετὰ χολῆς</span> of Mt.’s text, not without the joint influence of <a href="/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.">Psalm 69:22</a> (Meyer and Weiss). Harmonists strive to reconcile the two accounts by taking <span class="greekheb">χολή</span> as signifying in Hellenistic usage any bitter liquid (<span class="ital">quamvis amaritiem</span>, Elsner), and therefore among other things myrrh. <a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm" title="But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.">Proverbs 5:4</a>, Lament. <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.

Instead of "vinegar" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) very many manuscripts, followed by Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and others, read here, as in Mark, "wine" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Dederunt ei viaum bibere</span> (Vulgate).

The received reading in our text is supposed to be derived from <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me gall for my meats, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." "Gall" here signifies some bitter ingredient (St. Mark calls it "myrrh"), which was infused in the wine to impart a narcotic quality. It was the custom to offer this draught to criminals about to undergo crucifixion, either as an anodyne or to give them adventitious strength to bear their sufferings. The beverage is said to have been prepared by some benevolent ladies in Jerusalem, and to have been owed to a gloss on <a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul; let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more." This was not an additional insult offered to Jesus, as some have opined, but a usual act of kindliness. <span class="cmt_word">When he had tasted</span> thereof, <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">would not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>drink</span>. He accepted the kindly offer so far as to put his lips to the cup, but, recognizing its stupefying qualities, he refused to drink it. He willed to endure all the coming pains without mitigation; he would meet all with the powers of mind and body undarkened; he would have his senses and his self-consciousness unimpaired to the end. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wine (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The older texts read &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, vinegar.
