But in part also they may reasonably be ascribed to the natural variations sure to arise even among eye-witnesses, and <span class= "ital">à fortiori</span> among those who were not eye witnesses, as to the circumstantial details of events which they record in common.

He would at least recognise His claims to be in some sense a King. The priests obviously felt it to imply such a recognition, a declaration, as it were, to them and to the people that One who had a right to be their King, who was the only kind of King they were ever likely to have, had died the death of a malefactor, and therefore they clamoured for a change, which Pilate refused to make (<a href="/john/19-20.htm" title="This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.">John 19:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS....">Matthew 27:37-38</a></span>. <span class="ital">And set over his head his accusation </span>— That is, a superscription, containing the substance of his pretended crime, written in capital letters, and in these remarkable words, THIS IS JESUS, (John adds, OF NAZARETH,) THE KING OF THE JEWS.

Bishop Pearson, (On <span class="ital">the Creed, </span>p. 205,) and Dr. Lardner, (<span class="ital">Credibil., </span>vol. 1. p. 347,) have abundantly proved it to be usual, in cases of any extraordinary punishment, to put an inscription over the head of the sufferer, indicative of the crime for which he suffered. <span class="ital">Then were there two thieves crucified with him — </span>“They placed Jesus in the middle, by way of mock honour, because he had called himself a king, and was now crowned with thorns; or, if the priests had any hand in this, they might design hereby to impress the spectators more strongly with the thought of his being an impostor, and to make them look on him as the chief malefactor.

Their design in which was, to prevent the offence which might otherwise have been taken at Christ’s sufferings.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:35-44 It was usual to put shame upon malefactors, by a writing to notify the crime for which they suffered. So they set up one over Christ's head. This they designed for his reproach, but God so overruled it, that even his accusation was to his honour. There were crucified with him at the same time, two robbers. He was, at his death, numbered among the transgressors, that we, at our death, might be numbered among the saints. The taunts and jeers he received are here recorded. The enemies of Christ labour to make others believe that of religion and of the people of God, which they themselves know to be false. The chief priests and scribes, and the elders, upbraid Jesus with being the King of Israel. Many people could like the King of Israel well enough, if he would but come down from the cross; if they could but have his kingdom without the tribulation through which they must enter into it. But if no cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those that would reign with him, must be willing to suffer with him. Thus our Lord Jesus, having undertaken to satisfy the justice of God, did it, by submitting to the punishment of the worst of men. And in every minute particular recorded about the sufferings of Christ, we find some prediction in the Prophets or the Psalms fulfilled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And set up over his head - John says <a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a> that Pilate wrote the title and put it upon the cross. Probably Pilate wrote it or caused it to be written, and directed the soldiers to set it up. A man is often said to do what he directs others to do. It was customary to set up over the heads of persons crucified the crime for which they suffered, and the name of the sufferer The accusation on which Jesus had been condemned by Pilate was his claiming to be the King of the Jews.<p>This is Jesus, the King of the Jews - The evangelists differ in the account of this title. Mark Mar 15:26 says it was, "The King of the Jews." Luke Luk 23:38, "This is the King of the Jews." John Joh 19:19, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." But the difficulty may be easily removed. John says that the title was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. It is not at all improbable that the inscription "varied" in these languages. One evangelist may have translated it from the Hebrew, another from the Greek, a third from the Latin, and a fourth may have translated one of the inscriptions a little differently from another. Besides, the evangelists all agree in the main point of the inscription, namely, that he was the King of the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 27:34-50.

And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on</span> <span class="ital">the cross. And the writing was, Jesus of Nazareth the King of the</span> <span class="ital">Jews. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where</span> <span class="ital">Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in</span> <span class="ital">Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said the chief priests of the</span> <span class="ital">Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, </span> <span class="ital">I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written I have</span> <span class="ital">written. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took</span> <span class="ital">his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and</span> <span class="ital">also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top</span> <span class="ital">throughout. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend</span> <span class="ital">it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture</span> <span class="ital">might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among</span> <span class="ital">them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things</span> <span class="ital">therefore the soldiers did. And they crucified him; </span> that is, four soldiers, as we learn from John’s narration of this matter of fact; it seemeth this business was assigned to four more especially. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This crucifying was a bitter and shameful kind of death, not in use amongst the Jews, but amongst the Romans. The manner of it is not particularly known to us: but, as it is described by writers, a piece of wood was erected which was crossed with a bar upon the top. The body of the person being fastened to the main piece of wood, his arms were extended, and nailed to the cross bar, or piece of timber, and his hands and feet were nailed. Mark saith, <span class="ital">it was the third hour, </span> which with us was about nine of the clock: so hasty they were in destroying this just person, that between midnight and nine of the clock in the morning, they apprehended him, tried and condemned him in the sanhedrim, or at least in a court of high priests and elders, and then before Pilate the Roman governor, and led him to be crucified, and nailed him to his cross. The evangelists tell us, he was crucified in the middle between two thieves, of whom we shall read more afterward. Several scriptures of the Old Testament were fulfilled in this crucifixion of Christ. <span class="ital">They pierced my hands and my feet, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/22-16.htm" title="For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.">Psalm 22:16</a></span>, was fulfilled in his nailing to the cross. In his being crucified betwixt two thieves was fulfilled that, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a></span>, <span class="ital">He was numbered with the transgressors.</span> That of the psalmist, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/22-18.htm" title="They part my garments among them, and cast lots on my clothing.">Psalm 22:18</a></span>, <span class="ital">They parted my garments among them, and cast lots</span> <span class="ital">upon my vesture, </span> was fulfilled in the soldiers’ parting of our Saviour’s garments, as their fee. But how could they part them, and yet not rend them? Possibly they parted his other garments, and only did cast lots for his coat, or upper garment. Or, it may be, they valued it, and agreed each man’s share, and then cast lots for the whole. I see no ground for their assertion, who say, that in such cases they only stripped the condemned person of his upper garment. John’s relation seemeth to oppose it; he saith, <span class="ital">and also his coat.</span> Matthew, Mark, and John all agree in the inscription which Pilate drew to be put upon his cross, signifying the crime for which he died; only John puts in those words, <span class="ital">of Nazareth.</span> Thus Christ died in the attestation of his kingly office. This inscription angered the Jews; they solicit Pilate to alter it, and that it might be, Who said he was the King of the Jews. But Pilate refused, saying, <span class="ital">What I have</span> <span class="ital">written I have written.</span> There was nothing more pleasing to Pilate than this, (as he thought), to deride the Jews, as having such a despicable person (as he judged him) their King. In the mean time the counsels of God have their effect; Christ in his death is declared to be the King of the Jews. Luke saith, that Christ said, <span class="ital">Father, </span> <span class="ital">forgive them; for they know what they do.</span> Whether these words were spoken when our Lord was first nailed to the cross, or afterward, is not much material. Luke relates them before the soldiers’ parting his garments. Our Saviour by them declares himself a true Pastor and Shepherd of souls, teaching his disciples no more than he himself did practise. <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a></span>, he had taught his disciples to pray for them who despitefully used and persecuted them. Himself here practises it. The malice of men ought not to quench in Christians the grace of God. Let us now consider the passage that happened from the time he was nailed to the cross until the time of his expiration, which was more than three entire hours. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And set up over his head his accusation written,.... The Evangelist John calls it a "title", <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>, and Luke, a "superscription", <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm">Luke 23:38</a>, and Mark, the "superscription of his accusation", <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/15-26.htm">Mark 15:26</a>, it was what contained the sum and substance of what he was accused, and for which he was condemned, and suffered. The Syriac and Persic versions here render it, "the cause of his death". It was written by Pilate in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, that all might read it; and by his orders it was put upon the cross, and over the head of Jesus by the soldiers. This title, or inscription, setting forth the person's crime, used to be carried before him, or put upon him, as he was led to execution (x): but here it was set upon the cross, and perhaps nailed unto it; to which the apostle seems to allude in <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, the substance of it was, <p>this is Jesus the king of the Jews. This was what the chief priests accused him of to Pilate, and about which he questioned him, and for which they desired he might be crucified; urging, that should he let him go, he could not be Caesar's friend. Hence Pilate wrote his accusation in this form, not so much in derision of Jesus; for by conversation with him he understood what sort of a king he was, as to the reproach of the Jews for crucifying him who was their king; being the person that was prophesied of in their books, as king of Zion, and whom they expected as such, though now they denied and rejected him, <p>(x) Lipsius de Cruce, l. 2. c. 11. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span><p>(9) He is pronounced the true Messiah, even by those who reject him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/27.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Matthew 27:37</a> Whether it was <span class="ital">customary</span> to have a tablet (<span class="greekheb">σανίς</span>) put over the cross containing a statement of the crime (<span class="greekheb">τὴν αἰτίαν αὐτοῦ</span>) for which the offender was being executed, we have no means of knowing.

This variation points to the independence of the different Gospels, and also indicates that a real though not a verbal accuracy should be looked for in the records of the Evangelists.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Matthew 27:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐστιν</span>, <span class="ital">is</span>) Yes; He truly <span class="ital">is</span> so!

It was written in three languages, so that all of whatever nationality might read it - in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek (for the order, see Westcott on <a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the national Aramaic, familiar to all Jews; the official Latin,understood by the soldiers and Romans; the current Greek, the dialect of Hellenistic Jews, and largely used by all classes. "These three languages gathered up the results of the religious, the social, the intellectual preparation for Christ, and in each witness was given to his office" (Westcott). The title is given by the four evangelists with some verbal variations, which are owing in part to the actual differences existing in the three versions of the inscription. They run thus: "'This is Jesus the King of the Jews" (Matthew); "The King of the Jews" (Mark); "This is the King of the Jews" (Luke); "Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews" (John). Of these titles, those given by Mark and Luke probably represent the Latin; that of Matthew, the Greek; while that of John was intended for the national population, who alone would understand the veiled sneer contained in the addition, "of Nazareth." The legend of the finding of the cross and its inscription is given by Butler, 'Lives of the Saints,' on 'The Invention of the Holy Cross.' A supposed fragment of the title is preserved at Rome, in the Church of the Holy Cross, and declared by a papal bull to be authentic. In this case infallibility has rather overstepped its limits. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Accusation (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., cause, and so rendered by Wyc.
