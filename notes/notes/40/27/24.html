Pilate probably chose it, partly as a relief to his own conscience, partly to appease his wife’s scruples, partly as a last appeal of the most vivid and dramatic kind to the feelings of the priests and people. One of the popular poets of his own time and country might have taught him the nullity of such a formal ablution—<p>“Ah nimium faciles, qui tristia crimina cædis<p>Flumineâ tolli posse putetis aquâ.”<p>“Too easy souls who dream the crystal flood<p>Can wash away the fearful guilt of blood.”<p>Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fast. ii.</span> 45.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/27-24.htm" title="When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it....">Matthew 27:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing </span>— That he could not convince them what an unjust, unreasonable thing it was for him to condemn a man whom he believed to be innocent, and whom they could not prove to be guilty; and that instead of doing any good by his opposition to their will, <span class="ital">a tumult was made </span>— Through their furious outcries; <span class="ital">he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude </span>— Pilate did this, says Origen, <span class="ital">according to the custom of the Jews, </span>being <span class="ital">willing to assert Christ’s innocency to them, not in words only, but by deed. </span>Thus, in the instance of a murder, committed by an unknown hand, the elders of the city nearest to the place where the dead body was found, were to <span class="ital">wash their hands </span>over a heifer slain by way of sacrifice to expiate the crime, and to say, <span class="ital">Our hands have not shed this blood, </span><a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm" title="And all the elders of that city, that are next to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>. Alluding to which ceremony, the psalmist, having renounced all confederacy with wicked and mischievous men, says, <span class="ital">I will wash my hands in innocency. </span>But as washing the hands in token of innocence was a rite frequently used. also by the Gentiles, it is much more probable that Pilate, who was a Gentile, did this in conformity to them. He thought, possibly, by this avowal of his resolution to have no hand in the death of Christ, to have terrified the populace; for one of his understanding and education could not but be sensible that all the water in the universe was not able to wash away the guilt of an unrighteous sentence. <span class="ital">Saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it </span>— Nevertheless, solemn as his declaration was, it had no effect; for the people continued inflexible, crying out with one consent, <span class="ital">His blood be on us and on our children — </span>That is, We are willing to take the guilt of his death upon ourselves. The governor, therefore, finding by the sound of the cry that it was general, and that the people were fixed in their choice of Barabbas, passed the sentence they desired. <span class="ital">He released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired, but he delivered Jesus to their will, </span><a href="/luke/23-25.htm" title="And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.">Luke 23:25</a>. In this conduct, notwithstanding his efforts to save Jesus, he was utterly inexcusable, and the more so the more he was convinced of Christ’s innocence. He had an armed force under his command sufficient to have scattered this infamous mob, and to have enforced the execution of a righteous sentence. But if not, he ought himself rather to have suffered death than to have knowingly condemned the innocent. Accordingly, as the ancient Christians believed, great calamities afterward befell him and his family, as a token of the displeasure of God for his perversion of justice in this instance. According to Josephus, he was deposed from his government by Vitellius, and sent to Tiberius at Rome, who died before he arrived there. And we learn from Eusebius, that quickly after, having been banished to Vienne in Gaul, he laid violent hands upon himself, falling on his own sword. Agrippa, who was an eye-witness to many of his enormities, speaks of him, in his oration to Caius Cesar, as one who had been a man of the most infamous character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the imprecation of the Jewish priests and people, <span class="ital">His blood be on us and on our children, </span>it is well known, that as it was dreadfully answered in the ruin so quickly brought on the Jewish nation, and the calamities which have since pursued that wretched people in almost all ages and countries; so it was particularly illustrated in the severity with which Titus, merciful as he naturally was, treated the Jews whom he took during the siege of Jerusalem; of whom Josephus himself writes, [<span class="ital">Bell. Jud., 50. </span>5:11, (al. <a href="/matthew/6-12.htm" title="And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.">Matthew 6:12</a>,) § 1,] that <span class="greekheb">μαστιγουμενοι ανεσταυρουντο</span>, <span class="ital">having been scourged, and tortured in a very terrible manner, they were crucified </span>in the view and near the walls of the city; perhaps, among other places, on mount Calvary; and it is very probable, this might be the fate of some of those very persons who now joined in this cry, as it undoubtedly was of many of their children. For Josephus, who was an eye-witness, expressly declares, “that the number of those thus crucified was so great that there was not room for the crosses to stand by each other; and that at last they had not wood enough to make crosses off.” A passage which, especially when compared with the verse before us, must impress and astonish the reader beyond any other in the whole story. If this were not the very finger of God, pointing out their crime in crucifying his Son, it is hard to say what could deserve to be called so. Elsner has abundantly shown, that among the Greeks, the persons on whose testimony others were put to death used, by a very solemn execration, to devote themselves to the divine vengeance, if the person so condemned were not really guilty.

The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it.

See <a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>. Pilate, in doing this, meant to denote that they were guilty of his death, but that he was innocent. But the mere washing of his hands did not free him from guilt. He was "bound" as a magistrate to free an innocent man; and whatever might be the clamour of the Jews, "he" was guilty at the bar of God for suffering the holy Saviour to be led to execution, in order to gratify the malice of enraged priests and the clamors of a tumultuous populace.<p>See ye to it - That is, take it upon yourselves.

Naught that he did altered the determination of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">But that rather a tumult was</span> <span class="cmt_word">made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is <span class="accented">arising</span>). The present tense gives a graphic touch to the narrative. The delay and hesitation of the governor exasperated the people, and there were ominous signs of a riot, which must be suppressed at any sacrifice of principle or equity. He feared that a report might reach Rome of his having occasioned dangerous excitement at the Passover by refusing to punish a pretender to the Jewish throne, he submits to the popular will, but endeavours to save himself from the guilt of an accomplice in a most atrocious murder. <span class="cmt_word">Took water,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and washed his hands before the multitude.</span> This symbolical action would appeal to the Jewish sentiment, as it was a mode of asserting innocence prescribed in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>). Pilate thus publicly, in the sight of all the multitude who might not have been able to hear his words, attested his opinion of the innocence of Christ, and weakly cast the guilt upon the people, as if the administration of justice lay with them and not with him. Such lustrations were not exclusively Jewish, but were practised both among Greeks and Romans in expiation of guilt (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and Kuinoel, <span class="accented">ad</span> cap. 3:6). <span class="cmt_word">I am innocent of the blood of this just Person.</span> Some manuscripts, followed by Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort, omit "just Person (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." If the word is genuine, it must be regarded as an echo of the wife's message to Pilate (ver. 19). The cowardly governor thus shakes off the responsibility of the perversion of justice which he allows. <span class="cmt_word">See ye to it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vos videritis</span>, as ver. 4). You will take all the responsibility of the act; the blame will not be mine. Vain hope! Pilate may wash his hands, he cannot purify heart or conscience from the stain of this foul murder. As long as the Church lasts so long will the Creed announce that Jesus "suffered under Pontius Pilate." </body></html>
