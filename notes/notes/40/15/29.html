It was the one instance in which He visited a distinctly heathen city, and walked by the shore of the Great Sea, and looked out towards the isles of Chittim, the isles of the Gentiles, to which His name was to come in after years as the message of joy and peace and life. It is significant, as Sidon lay to the north of Tyre, that He thus extended His journey, as though seeking for Himself and His disciples a longer period of rest for prayer and meditation. His return to Galilee must have been through some of the mountain passes of the Hermon range, bringing Him down upon the eastern shore of the lake.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/15-29.htm" title="And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there....">Matthew 15:29-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus came unto the sea of Galilee </span>— The Jews gave the name of seas to all large lakes. This was one hundred furlongs long, and forty broad. It was called also <span class="ital">the sea of Tiberias. </span>It lay on the borders of Galilee, and the city of Tiberias stood on its western shore. It was likewise styled <span class="ital">the lake of Gennesaret; </span>perhaps a corruption of <span class="ital">Cinnereth, </span>the name by which it was anciently called. See notes on <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>, and <a href="/context/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;...">Matthew 4:15-16</a>. <span class="ital">And went up into a mountain and sat down </span>— Not only to rest himself, but also, and especially, to teach the people, who resorted to him in great multitudes; <span class="ital">having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, </span>&c. — The dumb were probably deaf also, and the <span class="ital">maimed, </span>such as had lost one or more limbs, as the word <span class="greekheb">κυλλους</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>properly signifies. It is true, it is sometimes applied to those who were only disabled in those parts; we may “reasonably suppose, however, that among the many maimed who were brought on such occasions, there were, at least, some whose <span class="ital">limbs had been cut off; </span>and I thinks,” says Dr. Doddridge, “hardly any of the miracles of our Lord were more illustrious and amazing than the recovery of such.” <span class="ital">And many others </span>— Who had different complaints; <span class="ital">and cast them down at Jesus’s feet </span>— Entreating his compassion, which was so moved at the sight of so many people in distress, that he graciously <span class="ital">healed them all. </span>On these miracles, Dr. Macknight remarks as follows: “On the dumb, who are commonly deaf also, he not only conferred the faculty of hearing and pronouncing articulate sounds, but conveyed into their minds at once the whole language of their country, making them perfectly acquainted with all the words in it, their significations, and their uses, so as to comprehend the whole distinctly in their memories, and, at the same time, he gave them the habit of speaking it both fluently and copiously. This was a kind of miracle vastly astonishing. The change that was produced in the bodies of the men was but the least part of it; what passed in their minds was the principal thing, being an effect so extensive that nothing inferior to infinite power could produce it. With respect to the <span class="ital">maimed, </span>that is, persons who had lost their legs and arms, Jesus gave them new members in their stead. But when he thus created such parts of their bodies as were wanting, without having any thing at all, as a subject, to work upon, the spectators could not have been more surprised had they seen him make a whole human body out of the dust of the earth.” Accordingly, on the sight of these miracles, it is here said, <span class="ital">They wondered and glorified the God of Israel. </span>See also <a href="/matthew/9-33.htm" title="And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.">Matthew 9:33</a>; and <a href="/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw....">Matthew 12:22-23</a>; <a href="/mark/7-37.htm" title="And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.">Mark 7:37</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:29-39 Whatever our case is, the only way to find ease and relief, is to lay it at Christ's feet, to submit it to him, and refer it to his disposal. Those who would have spiritual healing from Christ, must be ruled as he pleases. See what work sin has made; what various diseases human bodies are subject to. Here were such diseases as fancy could neither guess the cause nor the cure of, yet these were subject to the command of Christ. The spiritual cures that Christ works are wonderful. When blind souls are made to see by faith, the dumb to speak in prayer, the maimed and the lame to walk in holy obedience, it is to be wondered at. His power was also shown to the multitude, in the plentiful provision he made for them: the manner is much the same as before. All did eat, and were filled. Those whom Christ feeds, he fills. With Christ there is bread enough, and to spare; supplies of grace for more than seek it, and for those that seek for more. Christ sent away the people. Though he had fed them twice, they must not look for miracles to find their daily bread. Let them go home to their callings and their own tables. Lord, increase our faith, and pardon our unbelief, teaching us to live upon thy fulness and bounty, for all things pertaining to this life, and that which is to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sea of Galilee - That is, the Lake of Gennesaret.
