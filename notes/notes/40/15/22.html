St. Mark describes her more definitely as “a Greek” (i.e., a heathen, the name “Greek” having gained a wider connotation, much as “Frank” has done in recent times), a “Syro-Phœnician by nation.”<p><span class= "bld">Came out of the same coasts.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">of those regions, coming forth </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from some house or village), <span class= "ital">cried</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">O Lord, thou son of David.</span>—The words show that the fame of the Prophet of Nazareth had travelled beyond the limits of Galilee, and that He was known to the people of the Tyre and Sidon district by the most popular of the Messianic names.

Among the multitude that listened to the Sermon on the Plain, and brought those that were “vexed with unclean spirits,” had been people “from the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon.” The mother of the demoniac daughter may well have cherished for months the hope that one day the great Deliverer would come within her reach. And now, beyond all expectation, He had come across the boundary of Israel, and she saw Him in her own country. St. Mark adds, significantly, that “He would have no man know” of His presence, but He “could not be hid” (<a href="/mark/7-24.htm" title="And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.">Mark 7:24</a>).

The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; and though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not therefore be driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instance of mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads not merit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially for their souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a proud devil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at his will? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession, and you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone is able to heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially of his grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may be explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love in Christ's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encourages us, though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whom Christ intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their own unworthiness. A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; but she turned it into an argument to support her request. The state of this woman is an emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul. The least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honours Christ most; therefore of all graces Christ honours faith most. He cured her daughter. He spake, and it was done. From hence let such as seek help from the Lord, and receive no gracious answer, learn to turn even their unworthiness and discouragements into pleas for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A woman of Canaan - This woman is called, also, a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, <a href="/mark/7-26.htm">Mark 7:26</a><p>In ancient times, the whole land, including Tyre and Sidon, was in the possession of the Canaanites, and called Canaan. The Phoenicians were descended from the Canaanites. The country, including Tyre and Sidon, was called Phoenicia, or Syro-Phoenicia.

This woman was therefore a Gentile, living under the Greek government, and probably speaking the Greek language.

The first of these characters expresses her faith in his power, dominion, and government, that all persons and things, and so all diseases were at his command, and control; and that being Lord of all, he could remove them at his pleasure: the other shows her knowledge and belief of him, as the Messiah, that being a name by which he was usually known by the Jews; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a> and which she, though a Gentile, might come at the knowledge of, either through being a proselyte to the Jewish religion, or through a general report which might reach, especially the neighbouring nations, that the Jews expected a wonderful deliverer to arise among them, under this character of the son of David; and from what she had heard of him, she concluded he must be the person. <p>My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil, which had took possession of her, and most grievously afflicted her: and her request to him was, that he would cast him out of her: believing he had power so to do, without seeing or touching her, only by a word speaking: her faith was like that of the centurion's. <p>(i) Lucian.

Living among a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles, she had heard this title applied to Jesus; she knew something of the hopes of the Hebrew nation, that they were expecting a Messiah, son of the great King David, who should preach to the poor and heal the sick, as she heard that Jesus had done. We know that the reputation of Jesus had spread into these parts, and that persons from this country had come to him to be healed (<a href="/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>; <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). There is no reason to suppose that the woman was a proselyte; but evidently she was of a humble and religious spirit, open to conviction, and of an enlightened understanding, which needed only grace and instruction to ripen into faith. At present she saw in Christ only a merciful Wonder-worker - an error which he often combated, and which now by his conduct he corrected. <span class="cmt_word">My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span> She must have learned from her Hebrew neighbours to attribute her child's malady to demoniacal influence, as such an idea would not have naturally occurred to a heathen Greek. The power of the devil was shown more openly in heathen localities. We do not read of many bad cases of possession in strictly Jewish districts. It is in Gentile or semi-Gentile regions that the worst instances occur; and while the pagan inhabitants attributed the mysterious maladies to natural causes, the truer insight of believers assigned them, and often most justly, to spiritual agencies. In the present case, the possession must have been unconnected with any ethical relations. It was not that the child, by any act of her own, had put herself into the demon's power. We must regard it, like the sufferings of innocent infants, as a providential arrangement which God for wise purposes allows. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Out of the same coasts (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., as Rev., from those borders; i.e., she crossed from Phoenicia into Galilee.<p>Cried (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>With a loud, importunate cry: from behind.
