Those wandering sheep, without a shepherd, were the appointed objects of His care. Were He to go beyond that limit in a single case, it might be followed by a thousand, and then, becoming, as it were, before the time, the Apostle of the Gentiles, He would cease to draw to Himself the hearts of Israel as their Redeemer. We call to mind the case of the centurion’s servant (<a href="/matthew/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.">Matthew 8:10</a>), and wonder that that was not decisive as a precedent in the supplicant’s favour. The two cases stood, however, on a very different footing. The centurion who had built a synagogue was practically, if not formally, a proselyte of the gate. As the elders of the synagogue pleaded for him as worthy, the work of healing wrought for him would not alienate them or their followers. The woman belonged, on the contrary, to the most scorned and hated of all heathen races, to the Canaan on which the primeval curse was held to rest (<a href="/genesis/9-25.htm" title="And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.">Genesis 9:25</a>), and had as yet done nothing to show that she was in any sense a convert to the faith of Israel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:21-28 The dark corners of the country, the most remote, shall share Christ's influences; afterwards the ends of the earth shall see his salvation. The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; and though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not therefore be driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instance of mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads not merit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially for their souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a proud devil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at his will? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession, and you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone is able to heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially of his grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may be explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love in Christ's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encourages us, though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whom Christ intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their own unworthiness. A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; but she turned it into an argument to support her request. The state of this woman is an emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul. The least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honours Christ most; therefore of all graces Christ honours faith most. He cured her daughter. He spake, and it was done. From hence let such as seek help from the Lord, and receive no gracious answer, learn to turn even their unworthiness and discouragements into pleas for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he answered and said, I am not sent ... - This answer was made to the woman, not to the disciples.<p>The "lost sheep of the house of Israel" were the Jews.

Zigabenus, Luther, Glöckler, assert that His aim was to furnish her with an opportunity for <span class="ital">displaying her faith</span>. But the moral sense protests against this apparent cruelty of playing the part of a dissembler with the very intention of tormenting; it rather prefers to recognise in our Lord’s demeanour <span class="ital">a sincere disposition to repel</span>, which, however, is subsequently <span class="ital">conquered</span> by the woman’s unshaken trust (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">καλὴν ἀναισχυντίαν</span>). Ewald appropriately observes how, on this occasion, Jesus shows His greatness in a twofold way: first, in prudently and resolutely confining Himself to the sphere of His own country; and then in no less thoughtfully overstepping this limit whenever a higher reason rendered it proper to do so, and as if to foreshadow what was going to take place a little farther on in the future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was not intended that Christ should come to the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> in the days of His flesh, but that He should do so at a subsequent period (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>), in the person of the Spirit acting through the medium of apostolic preaching (<a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>). But the difficulty of reconciling this with <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a>, on which Hilgenfeld lays some stress, as being in favour of our present narrative, is somewhat lessened by the fact that, according to <a href="/luke/7-2.htm" title="And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.">Luke 7:2</a> ff., the centurion was living in the heart of the people, and might be said to be already pretty much identified with Judaism; whereas we have a complete stranger in the case of the woman, before whom Jesus sees Himself called upon, in consequence of their request, <a href="/matthew/15-23.htm" title="But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and sought him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.">Matthew 15:23</a>, strictly to point out to <span class="ital">His disciples</span> that His mission, so far as its <span class="ital">fundamental object</span> was concerned, was to be confined <span class="ital">exclusively</span> to Israel. Volkmar, indeed, makes out that the words were never spoken at all; that their teaching is of a questionable nature; and that the whole thing is an imitation of the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17); while Scholten, p. 213, regards it merely as a <span class="ital">symbolical</span> representation of the relation of the Gentile world to the kingdom of God, and which had come to be treated as <span class="ital">a fact</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/15-24.htm" title="But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 15:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀπεστάλην</span>: Jesus is compelled to explain Himself, and His explanation is <span class="ital">bonâ fide</span>, and to be taken in earnest as meaning that He considered it His duty to restrict His ministry to Israel, to be a shepherd exclusively to the lost sheep of Israel (<span class="greekheb">τὰ πρόβατα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀ</span>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.">Matthew 9:36</a>), as He was wont to call them with affectionate pity. There was probably a mixture of feelings in Christ’s mind at this time; an aversion to recommence just then a healing ministry at all—a craving for rest and retirement; a disinclination to be drawn into a ministry among a heathen people, which would mar the unity of His career as a prophet of God to Israel (the drama of His life to serve its purpose must respect the limits of time and place); a secret inclination to do this woman a kindness if it could in any way be made exceptional; and last but not least, a feeling that her request was really not isolated but representative = the Gentile world in her inviting Him, a fugitive from His own land, to come over and help them, an omen of the transference of the kingdom from Jewish to Pagan soil.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel</span>] Jesus came to save all, but His personal ministry was confined, with few exceptions, to the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The thought of Israel as a flock of sheep lost on the mountains is beautifully drawn out, Ezekiel 34; “My flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them,” (<span class="ital"><a href="/matthew/15-6.htm" title="And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free.

Doubtless the woman had listened to the apostles' intercession, and thought her cause won; but the repulse is only repeated; this Gentile is beyond the sphere of his mission; he cannot help her without departing from the rule which he had set himself. Jesus says nothing here about the rejection of the Jews and the future ingathering of the Gentiles; he states merely that his personal mission while he was on earth was confined to the Hebrew nation. He was, as St. Paul calls him (<a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>), "a Minister of the circumcision." Later, he would send others to evangelize those who were now aliens from the chosen commonwealth; at present he has come unto his own possessions. <span class="cmt_word">Lost sheep.</span> There is a tenderness in this expression natural from the mouth of the good Shepherd. He had used it when he sent forth the twelve on their apostolical journey (<a href="/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>); the metaphor is found in the Old Testament (see <a href="/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>, etc.) It is appropriate here, where he is emphasizing his attitude towards the chosen people, and teaching the Canaanitish woman the relative position of Jew and Gentile. </body></html>
