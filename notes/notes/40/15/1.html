How thankful ought we to be for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear, that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent's wants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a little compass; In vain do they worship me. It will neither please God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be their recompence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-9</a>.<p>Then came to Jesus ... - Mark says that they saw the disciples of Jesus eating with unwashed hands.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Mt 15:1-20. Discourse on Ceremonial Pollution. ( = Mr 7:1, 23).<p>The time of this section was after that Passover which was nigh at hand when our Lord fed the five thousand (Joh 6:4)&#8212;the third Passover, as we take it, since His public ministry began, but which He did not keep at Jerusalem for the reason mentioned in Joh 7:1.<p>1. Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem&#8212;or "from Jerusalem." Mark (Mr 7:1) says they "came from" it: a deputation probably sent from the capital expressly to watch Him. As He had not come to them at the last Passover, which they had reckoned on, they now come to Him. "And," says Mark (Mr 7:2, 3), "when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen hands"&#8212;hands not ceremonially cleansed by washing&#8212;"they found fault. For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft"&#8212;literally, "in" or "with the fist"; that is, probably washing the one hand by the use of the other&#8212;though some understand it, with our version, in the sense of "diligently," "sedulously"&#8212;"eat not, holding the tradition of the elders"; acting religiously according to the custom handed down to them. "And when they come from the market" (Mr 7:4)&#8212;"And after market": after any common business, or attending a court of justice, where the Jews, as Webster and Wilkinson remark, after their subjection to the Romans, were especially exposed to intercourse and contact with heathens&#8212;"except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots, brazen vessels and tables"&#8212;rather, "couches," such as were used at meals, which probably were merely sprinkled for ceremonial purposes.
