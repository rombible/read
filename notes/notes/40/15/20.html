Nothing will last in the soul but the regenerating graces of the Holy Spirit; and nothing should be admitted into the church but what is from above; therefore, whoever is offended by a plain, seasonable declaration of the truth, we should not be troubled at it. The disciples ask to be better taught as to this matter. Where a weak head doubts concerning any word of Christ, an upright heart and a willing mind seek for instruction. It is the heart that is desperately wicked, Jer 17:9, for there is no sin in word or deed, which was not first in the heart. They all come out of the man, and are fruits of that wickedness which is in the heart, and is wrought there. When Christ teaches, he will show men the deceitfulness and wickedness of their own hearts; he will teach them to humble themselves, and to seek to be cleansed in the Fountain opened for sin and uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are the things which defile a man - These are the true sources of pollution in man.<p>These are what corrupt and degrade. It is not the neglect of washing the body which defiles; it is the deep, inward corruption of the heart. And what a fountain of pollution is the human soul! What an array of crimes to proceed from the heart of man! What a proof of guilt! What strictness is there in the law of God!

Mark hath this, with very small difference in words, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/7-18.htm" title="And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without enters into the man, it cannot defile him;...">Mark 7:18-23</a></span>; only he specifies some more sins than Matthew enumerates. The sum of what our Saviour saith is this: That all sin proceedeth from lust, some desires in the heart of man after things forbidden in the law of God. All the ticklings of our hearts with such thoughts, all the willings and desires of such things, though they never issue in overt acts, yet defile and pollute a man; and from these inward motions of the heart proceed those overt acts (mentioned by Matthew or Mark) of <span class="ital">murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, pride, foolishness:</span> now these things, take them in their nest, which is the heart, they defile and pollute that; take them in their passage through our lips into the world, they pollute that; take them in their overt act, they pollute the man. But to eat with unwashen hands, a thing no where forbidden by God, only by the Pharisees, who had no such authority given them from God to command any such things, this doth not pollute a man. It is possible that men may sin in not obeying the commandments of men, but it must be then in things in which God hath authorized them to command, and to determine our practice in, for the pollution lies in a disobedience to the commandment of God, not of men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are the things which defile a man,.... These are filthy in themselves, and must pollute all in whom they are; they bring a defilement on the whole man, both body and soul, fasten guilt upon him, and expose him to everlasting punishment: <p>but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man: should a man neglect to wash his bands before eating a common meal, this need give him no uneasiness; he contracts no filth to his soul hereby, nor any guilt to his conscience; nor does he break any law of God; nor is he liable to any penalty for such an omission. This is a trifling matter, and merits no regard; but the things before mentioned are in their nature evil: they are contrary to the law of God; they are abominable in his sight; they render men loathsome and odious to the divine being; and expose them to shame and ruin; and it is only the blood of Christ can cleanse them from the pollution and guilt of them, and secure them from that punishment they deserve. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/15-20.htm" title="These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.">Matthew 15:20</a>. mphatic final reassertion of the doctrine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/15-20.htm" title="These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.">Matthew 15:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον</span>, <span class="ital">do not defile the man</span>) In the very appellation of <span class="ital">man</span>, is contained (latet) an argument: for the spiritual nature, which is the superior part in man, is not reached by outward filth.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Thus Jesus sums up what has been said, and recalls the circumstance which led to the discourse, emphatically repeating his judgment on the Pharisaical gloss.  </body></html>
