Of all the accusations brought against Him this was the one that caused the greatest Pain, and drew forth the most indignant answer. He had restored peace and joy, freedom of reason and will to those who had lost them, had been doing His Father’s work on earth, and He was accused of being in league with the powers of evil. The work of healing was represented as the bait of the Tempter luring men to their final destruction.<p><span class= "bld">Every kingdom divided against itself.</span>—The answer assumes, as the teaching of the New Testament does from first to last, the existence of a kingdom of evil, compact and organised, with a distinct unity of purpose. The laws which govern the life of other kingdoms are applicable to that also. Its head and ruler was not likely to enter on a work which was self-destructive. Reason, calmness, peace, these were not his gifts to men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:...">Matthew 12:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Jesus knew their thoughts — </span>“It often happens, that through ignorance or weakness men form wrong judgments of things;” a conduct which, though censurable, admits of some excuse: “but when wrong judgments proceed from evil dispositions, then, indeed, do they become highly culpable. Therefore, to show that the judgment which the Pharisees passed at this time upon our Lord’s miracles was of the latter kind, the evangelist observes, that Jesus <span class="ital">knew their thoughts: </span>he knew that the wickedness of their hearts, and not the weakness of their understandings, had led them to form the opinion they had uttered, if it was their real opinion; or rather, to affirm it contrary to the conviction of their minds, which was the reason that, at the conclusion of his defence, he reprimanded them in the sharpest manner.” <span class="ital">And said, Every kingdom divided against itself </span>&c. — He proceeds to demonstrate the absurdity of their calumny, by an argument drawn from the common affairs of life: —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As if he had said, “If evil spirits assist me in working miracles for the confirmation of my doctrine, they do what they can to promote the spiritual worship and ardent love of the true God, and, as effectually as possible, excite men to the practice of universal justice, benevolence, temperance, and self-government; all these virtues being powerfully recommended by my doctrine. But thus to make the evil spirits fight against themselves, is evidently to make them ruin their own interest; unless it can be thought that the strength and welfare of a society is advanced by jarring discord and destructive civil wars. Your judgment, therefore, of my conduct, is palpably malicious and absurd.” — Macknight. The word <span class="ital">Beelzebub </span>signifies <span class="ital">the lord </span>or <span class="ital">master of flies. </span>This was the great idol of the Ekronites; and from his name we may infer that they considered him as having the command of the various insects wherewith, in those warm climates, they were infested, and which ofttimes gathered into such swarms as proved both a noisome and a deadly plague. The Greeks, likewise, had a god, whose title was <span class="greekheb">μυιαργος</span>, <span class="ital">Muscarum venator, The destroyer of flies. </span>But he was in no great reputation among them, their country not being subject to this sort of calamity. The Ekronites being near neighbours to the Jews, the great veneration which they had for this idol made him the object both of the horror and detestation of the devout worshippers of the true God. Accordingly, to express in what detestation they held him, they appropriated his name to the most hateful being in the universe, calling the devil, or the prince of the evil angels. <span class="ital">Beelzebub; </span>for the next verse shows, that <span class="ital">Beelzebub </span>and <span class="ital">Satan </span>are different names of the same person; and consequently that Satan was considered as the prince of those demons who were cast out by Christ, and who are elsewhere represented as his angels. The word in the Greek is <span class="ital">Beelzebul, </span>which signifies, <span class="ital">the lord of a dunghill, </span>and seems to be a contemptuous change of the former name, by which it was intimated, that the noblest of the heathen deities were more fit to dwell on a dunghill than to be worshipped in a magnificent temple.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Jesus knew their thoughts ... - To know the thoughts of the heart belongs only to God, <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.<p>Every kingdom ... - Their subtle and cunning device was completely foiled, and Jesus made their argument recoil on their own heads. A kingdom or a family can prosper only by living in harmony. The different parts and members must unite in promoting the same objects. If divided - if one part undoes what the other does - it must fall. So with the kingdom of Satan. It is your doctrine that Satan has "possessed" these whom I have cured. It is also your doctrine that he has helped me to cure them. If so, then he has helped me to undo what he had done. He has aided me to cast himself out - that is, to oppose and discomfit himself. At this rate, how can there be any stability in his kingdom?

If citizens fall out with their magistrates, or one with another, and turn out, and disfranchise each other; and if the heads of families, and the respective branches thereof, quarrel with, and divide from one another, a dissolution of the whole must ensue; and the same may be said of the kingdom and government of Satan. These, it is very likely, were common sayings among the Jews, and they might be very easily understood by them; and are very appropriately produced by Christ to illustrate the present case, and confute the vile and blasphemous suggestions of the Pharisees: a proverbial expression, much like to these, is to be read in the writings of the Jews,      , "every house, in which there is a division, at the end shall come to desolation" (u). <p>(u) Derech Eretz, c. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span><p>(5) The kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of the devil cannot abide together.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:...">Matthew 12:25-30</a>. <span class="ital">The theory shown to be absurd</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation</span>] Not that civil disputes destroy a nation, but a nation disunited, rent by factions, in the presence of a common enemy must fall.
