The teachers or interpreters of the Law had failed to catch the meaning of the simplest utterances of the prophets. “Mercy and not sacrifice,” moral and not positive duties, these made up the true life of religion, and were alone acceptable to God. It was because they had inverted the right relation of the two that they had, in this instance, condemned those whom our Lord now declares to have been in this respect absolutely guiltless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless....">Matthew 12:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">But if ye had known what that meaneth </span>— If ye had known the intent of that scripture, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>, <span class="ital">I will have mercy, </span>&c. — That is, I always prefer acts of mercy before matters of positive institution, when in any instance they interfere with each other; and even before all ceremonial institutions whatever; because these being only <span class="ital">means </span>of religion, are suspended, of course, if circumstances occur wherein they clash with love, which is the <span class="ital">end </span>of it: <span class="ital">ye would not have condemned the guiltless </span>— As you have now done, merely for rubbing out a handful of corn to refresh themselves in my service. <span class="ital">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day </span>— The law enjoining the observation of every seventh day as a day of holy rest, as all other laws, is in my power, and may be altered, enforced, or dispensed with, as I see good.

This expression, <span class="ital">is Lord even of the sabbath, </span>evidently implies, that the sabbath was an institution of great and distinguished importance. It may, perhaps, also refer to that signal act of authority which Christ afterward exerted over it, in changing it from the seventh to the first day of the week. If we suppose here a transposition of the seventh and eighth verses, then the eighth verse is a proof of the sixth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears of corn: the law of God allowed it, De 23:25. This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One greater than the temple - Here the Saviour refers to himself, and to his own dignity and power. "I have power over the laws; I can grant to my disciples a dispensation from those laws. An act which I command or permit them to do is therefore right." This proves that he was divine. None but God can authorize people to do a thing contrary to the divine laws. He refers them again <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a> to a passage he had before quoted (See the notes at <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>), showing that God preferred acts of righteousness, rather than a precise observance of a ceremonial law.<p>Mark adds <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a> "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." That is, the Sabbath was intended for the welfare of man; it was designed to promote his happiness, and not to produce misery by harsh, unfeeling requirements. It is not to be so interpreted as to produce suffering by making the necessary supply of wants unlawful. Man was not made for the Sabbath. Man was created first, and then the Sabbath was appointed for his happiness, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-3</a>. His necessities, his real comforts and needs, are not to be made to bend to that which was made "for him." The laws are to be interpreted favorably to his real wants and comforts. This authorizes works only of real necessity, not of imaginary wants, or amusements, or common business and worldly employments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

See on [1270]Mt 9:13.<p>ye would not have condemned the guiltless&#8212;that is, Had ye understood the great principle of all religion, which the Scripture everywhere recognizes&#8212;that ceremonial observances must give way before moral duties, and particularly the necessities of nature&#8212;ye would have refrained from these captious complaints against men who in this matter are blameless. But our Lord added a specific application of this great principle to the law of the sabbath, preserved only in Mark: "And he said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath" (Mr 2:27). A glorious and far-reaching maxim, alike for the permanent establishment of the sabbath and the true freedom of its observance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Neither Mark nor Luke have this argument. Our Lord yet goeth on taxing these great doctors of ignorance.

The meaning is, that God prefers mercy before sacrifice. Where two laws in respect of some circumstance seem to clash one with another, so as we cannot obey both, our obedience is due to that which is the more excellent law. Now, saith our Saviour, the law of mercy is the more excellent law; God prefers it before sacrifice; which had you well considered, you would never have accused my disciples, who in this point are guiltless. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if ye had known what this meaneth, The passage of Scripture in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a><p>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice; of the sense of which,  see Gill on <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>. <p>ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

T. Moods and Tenses, § 248). The Pharisees did not know what the oracle meant; hence on a previous occasion Jesus bade them go and learn (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>). If their pedantry blinded them to distinctions of higher and lower in institutions, or rather made them reckon the least the greatest command, minutiæ testing obedience, it still more deadened their hearts to the claims of mercy and humanity. Of course this idolatry went on from bad to worse. For the Jews of a later, templeless time, the law was greater than the temple (Holtz., in H.C., quoting Weber).—<span class="greekheb">ἀναιτίους</span>: doubly guiltless: as David was through imperious hunger, as the priests were when subordinating Sabbath, to temple, requirements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">I will have mercy, and not sacrifice</span>] Quoted a second time, <span class="bld">see</span> ch. <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>. There is something more binding than the Law, and that is the principle which underlies the Law. The Law rightly understood is the expression of God’s love to man. That love allowed the act of David, and the labour of the priests. “Shall it not permit My disciples to satisfy their hunger?”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐγνώκειτε</span>, <span class="ital">ye would have known</span>) The pluperfect tense.—<span class="greekheb">ἔλεον</span>, <span class="ital">mercy</span>) See ch. <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>.
