This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he said unto them ... - To vindicate his disciples, he referred them to a similar case, recorded in the Old Testament, and therefore one with which they ought to have been acquainted. This was the case of David. The law commanded that twelve loaves of bread should be laid on the table in the holy place in the tabernacle, to remain a week, and then to be eaten by the "priests only." Their place was then supplied by fresh "bread." This was called the "showbread," <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. David, fleeing before Saul, weary and hungry, had come to Ahimelech the priest; had found only this bread; had asked it of him, and had eaten it contrary to the "letter" of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-7</a>. David, among the Jews, had high authority. This act had passed uncondemned. It proved that in "cases of necessity the laws did not bind a man" - a principle which all laws admit. So the "necessity" of the disciples justified them in doing on the Sabbath what would have been otherwise unlawful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

If they had not read the Scriptures, they were very unfit persons either to be teachers, or censurers of others, and must have been very slothful and negligent; and if they had, they could not but have observed the case of David, which Christ produces in vindication of his disciples: <p>what David did when he was an hungred; which was the case of the disciples, and is therefore mentioned; it being also the circumstance which could, and did excuse what was done by David and his men: and the Jews themselves own, that in case of hunger the showbread might be eaten, by those that were not priests; not only that which was removed from the table, but that which was upon it; yea, even when there was none to put in its room (l); and that David was in the utmost distress, and therefore desired it, and it was granted him on that account. They represent him as thus saying to the priest (m), <p>"when he found there was none but showbread, give it me, that we may not die with hunger;   , "for danger of life drives away the sabbath";'' <p>which perfectly agrees with our Lord's argument, and justifies the apostles conduct: and this was not a single fact of David's, but of others also; <p>and they that were with him; for though in <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a> he is said to be "alone, and no man with him"; yet this must be understood either comparatively, having but very few with him, and which were as none, considering his dignity; or thus, though none came with him to Ahimelech, pretending to the priest he had a secret affair of the king's to transact; and therefore had left his servants in a certain place, and desires bread for himself and them; concerning whom the priest and he discourses, as may be seen in the place referred to: so that though no man was with him at the priest's house, yet there were some with him, and who partook with him in eating of the showbread. <p>(l) R.

The case of David was apposite because (<span class="ital">a</span>) it was a case of eating, (<span class="ital">b</span>) it probably happened on Sabbath, (<span class="ital">c</span>) it concerned not only David but, as in the present instance, <span class="ital">followers</span>; therefore <span class="greekheb">οἱ μετʼ αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm" title="But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;">Matthew 12:3</a>, carefully added. (<span class="ital">b</span>) does not form an element in the defence, but it helps to account for the reference to David’s conduct. In that view Jesus must have regarded the act of David as a Sabbatic incident, and that it was may not unnaturally be inferred from <a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm" title="So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.">1 Samuel 21:6</a>. <span class="ital">Vide</span> Lightfoot, <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>—This was probably also the current opinion.
