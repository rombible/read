The heart is the fountain, words are the streams. A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forth muddy and unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others. Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speak words agreeable to the Christian character.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O generation of vipers! - Christ here applies the argument which he had suggested in the previous verse. They were a wicked race; like poisonous reptiles, with a corrupt and evil nature. They could not be expected to speak good things - that is, to speak favorably of him and his works. As the bad fruit of a tree was the proper effect of its "nature," so were their words about him and his works the proper effect of their nature. The "abundance" or fullness of the "heart" produced the words of the lips. "Vipers" are a poisonous kind of serpents, not often a yard long, and about an inch thick, having a flat head. The males have two large teeth, through which a most deadly poison is thrown into the wound made by the bite. They are an emblem of malignity and mischief. These were strong expressions to be used by the meek and lowly Jesus; but they were not the effect of anger and malice; they were a declaration of the true character of the people with whom he was conversing - a declaration most justly deserved.

Though they boasted of their being the seed of Abraham, yet their immediate ancestors were no other than vipers, deceitful, hurtful, poisonous creatures; and they were exactly like them: for though they made a fair show in the flesh, and outwardly appeared righteous, yet were inwardly full of the poison of wickedness, envy and malice; and which their pestilential breath, their blasphemy against the Spirit, fully discovered; and gave just cause and reason for so severe a reproof, and such resentment, as here made by Christ. <p>How can ye, being evil, speak good things? This is not to be expected, nor is it commonly and constantly done; an evil man may sometimes speak good things, or which seem to be so; but these are not his common talk; as he is, so, for the most part, is his language; his speech betrays him: and since these men were by nature evil, were destitute of the Spirit and grace of God, had no good thing in them, how should any good thing come out of them? And since they were so full of wickedness, spite and malice, it is no wonder that they belched out such blasphemous expressions concerning the miracles of Christ; <p>for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh: a phrase much like this is used by the Septuagint, in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. "I spoke abundance", or "much in my heart";      "for the fool out of his abundance speaketh": as there is abundance of folly in him, there is much delivered out by him; and where there is abundance of wickedness in the heart, if the grace of God is wanting to restrain it, much of it will come out by the lips; as is a man's heart, ordinarily is his language. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span><p>(7) Hypocrites at length betray themselves even by their own mouth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/12-34.htm" title="O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.">Matthew 12:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἔστιν θαυμαστὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ τοιαῦτα</span> (the preposterous nature of which Jesus has just exposed, <a href="/matthew/12-33.htm" title="Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.">Matthew 12:33</a>) <span class="greekheb">βλασφημεῖτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">πονηροὶ γὰρ ὄντες οὐ δύνασθε ἀγαθὰ λαλεῖν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Εἶτα καὶ φυσιολογικῶς ἀποδείκνυσι πῶς οὐ δύνανται</span>, Euth.
