The Talmud discusses the question, but does not decide it. Some casuists solved the problem by a compromise. The sheep was not to be pulled out of the pit till the Sabbath was over, but in the meantime it was lawful to supply it with fodder. In St. Mark and St. Luke the question is given in another form, and without the illustration, which we find in St. Luke, in another connection, in <a href="/luke/14-5.htm" title="And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:5</a>. Jesus bids the man with the withered hand stand up in the midst, and then puts the question, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” The alternative thus presented as a dilemma was a practical answer to their casuistry. They would have said, “Leave the man as he is till the Sabbath is over;” and our Lord’s answer is that in that case good would have been left undone, and that not to do good when it lies in our power is practically to do evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/12-11.htm" title="And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?...">Matthew 12:11-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he said </span>— That he might show their unreasonableness, and confute them by their own practice: <span class="ital">What man — that shall have </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or, <span class="ital">Who, if he have but one sheep, that on the sabbath day shall fall into a pit, </span>and it be in danger of perishing there, <span class="ital">will not lay hold on it, </span>&c. —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The stress of the question does not lie on supposing a man to have only one sheep, but on one only falling into a pit; and yet, for the comparatively small value of that one, his not scrupling to undertake the labour of helping it out on the sabbath day. <span class="ital">How much then is a man better than a sheep? </span>As if he had said, If the regard you have for the life of your cattle leads you to do servile work on the sabbath, for the preservation of a single sheep, charity should much rather induce you to labour for the preservation of a fellow-creature, though the good office is to be done on the sabbath day. <span class="ital">Wherefore it is lawful to do well </span>— To save a beast, much more a man, or to perform any of the lovely acts of mercy and charity <span class="ital">on the sabbath day. </span>Our Lord, having spoken as above, according to St. <a href="/mark/3-5.htm" title="And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>, <span class="ital">looked round about upon them with anger, </span>with a holy indignation at their wickedness, <span class="ital">being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, </span>for their stupidity and impenitence, and for that condemnation and ruin which he knew they were thus bringing on themselves, as well as for the pernicious effect which their conduct would have on others. But at the same time that he testified his displeasure at the Pharisees, he relieved and comforted the infirm man, saying to him, <span class="ital">Stretch forth thy hand, </span>and, a divine power accompanying the word, he immediately stretched it out, and, in an instant, it was made sound as the other. The evangelists say no more; but leave their readers to imagine the wonder and astonishment of the numerous spectators, and the joy of the man who had recovered the use of so necessary a member.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:9-13 Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done on the Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days, than by the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor, helping those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care for their souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love and charity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, Ge 4:7. This, like other cures which Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning. By nature our hands are withered, and we are unable of ourselves to do any thing that is good. Christ only, by the power of his grace, cures us; he heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us both to will and to do: for, with the command, there is a promise of grace given by the word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The very hairs of your head are all numbered - That is, each one has exercised the care and attention of God.<p>He has fixed the number; and, though of small importance, yet he does not think it beneath him to determine how few or how many they shall be.

Christ appeals to them in a case which was usually done among them, and which, without delay, no man would scruple to do; though their present rule of direction, in such a case, is this (f): <p>"if a beast fall into a ditch, or a pool of water, if food can be given it, where it is, they feed it till the going out of the sabbath; but if not, bolsters and pillows may be brought, and put under it, and if it can come out: it may come out:'' <p>and which is elsewhere (g) a little differently expressed; <p>"if a beast fall into a ditch, or pool of water, it is forbidden a man to bring it out with his hand; but if he can give it food where it is, it may be fed till the going out of the sabbath:'' <p>which seems to have been made since the times of Christ, and in opposition to this observation of his. <p>(f) Maimon.

Humanity was what was lacking in the Pharisaic character.—<span class="greekheb">πρόβατον ἕν</span>: <span class="ital">one</span> sheep answering to the one working hand, whence perhaps Luke’s <span class="greekheb">ἡ δεξιὰ</span> (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm" title="But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:6</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐὰν ἐμπέσῃ</span>. The case supposed might quite well happen; hence in the protasis <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> with subjunctive, and in the apodosis the future (Burton, N. T. Moods and Tenses, § 250). A solitary sheep might fall into a ditch on a Sabbath; and that is what its owner would do if he were an ordinary average human being, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, lift it out at once. What would the <span class="ital">Pharisee</span> do? It is easy to see what he would be tempted to do if the one sheep were his own. But would he have allowed such action as a general rule? One would infer so from the fact that Jesus argued on such questions <span class="ital">ex concesso</span>. In that case the theory and practice of contemporary Pharisees must have been milder than in the Talmudic period, when the rule was: if there be no danger, leave the animal in the ditch till the morrow (<span class="ital">vide</span> Buxtorf, Syn. Jud., c. xvi.). Grotius suggests that later Jewish law was made stricter out of hatred to Christians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. In the other Synoptic Gospels the argument is different. “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life or to kill? St Matthew states the argument that bears specially on the Jewish Law. St Luke, however, mentions the application of the same argument by our Lord on a different occasion, ch. <a href="/matthew/14-5.htm" title="And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.">Matthew 14:5</a>.

Their own feelings would guide them to help a brute, much more a man.

He would feel an interest in it as an animal that he had learned to love; and he would care for it as his property. In Christ's case also there was the love of man as man, and of man as belonging to him (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>; <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).
