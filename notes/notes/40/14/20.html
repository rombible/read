So Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 14) describes the Jews of Italy as travelling with “their <span class= "ital">cophinus</span> and a wisp of hay,” by way of pillow, as their only luggage. St. John records that the gathering was made by our Lord’s express commands, “that nothing be lost.” The marvellous display of creative power was not to supersede forethought, thrift, economy in the use of the gifts it had bestowed. It is probable, from the language of the disciples in <a href="/mark/6-37.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?">Mark 6:37</a>, and from <a href="/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>, that they were in the habit of distributing food to the poor in the villages and towns in which they preached, and the fragments were, we may believe, reserved for that use.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:13-21 When Christ and his word withdraw, it is best for us to follow, seeking the means of grace for our souls before any worldly advantages. The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions of Christ's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfy all that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they did all eat, and were filled - This was an undoubted miracle.<p>The quantity must have been greatly increased to have supplied so many. He that could increase that small quantity so much had the power of creation; and he that could do that could create the world out of nothing, and had no less than divine power.<p>Twelve baskets full - The size of these baskets is unknown. They were probably such as travelers carried their provisions in. They were used commonly by the Jews in their journeys. In traveling among the Gentiles or Samaritans, a Jew could expect little hospitality. There were not, as now, public houses for the entertainment of strangers. At great distances there were caravansaries, but they were intended chiefly as lodging-places for the night, and not to provide food for travelers. Hence, in journeying among strangers or in deserts, they carried baskets of provisions, and this is the reason why they were furnished with them here. It is probable that each of the apostles had one, and they were all filled. John Joh 6:12 says that Jesus directed them to gather up these fragments, that nothing might be lost - an example of economy. God creates all food; it has, therefore, a kind of sacredness; it is all needed by some person or other, and none should be lost.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 14:12-21.

Christ and his twelve disciples, and the five thousand men, with the women and children, of the five loaves and two fishes; everyone had their portion, <p>and were filled; they were satisfied, they had a full meal, they had enough, and to spare; see <a href="/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a> which the Targumist paraphrases thus. <p>"And Azariah said unto him, who was appointed chief over the house of Zadok, and said, from the time that they began to separate the offering, to bring it into the sanctuary of the Lord, , "we have eat and are filled", and have "left much"; for "the word of the Lord" hath blessed his people, and what is left, lo! it is this plenty of good.'' <p>The Jews used not to reckon it a meal, unless a man was filled, and account it an ill sign, if nothing was left: but here was fulness, and more left than was first had; which was gathered up, either for the use of the poor, or reserved for after service; teaching us liberality to the needy, and frugality, not to waste that which is left. <p>And they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full; according to the number of the disciples, every man had his basket full. It may be inquired, where they could have so many baskets in the wilderness? It is not likely, that everyone of the apostles had a basket with him; it is indeed not improbable, but that they might be furnished with them from some in the company, who might bring provisions with them, either for their own use, or to sell; see <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a> but perhaps the reason why they were so easily supplied with such a number of baskets in a desert place, might be a custom which the Jews (h) had of carrying baskets with hay and straw, in commemoration of what they did in Egypt; when they were obliged to carry bricks in baskets, and to go about and pick up straw in baskets to make bricks; hence the (i) Epigrammatist calls a "Jew", "cistifer", a "basket bearer", or "carrier"; and Juvenal (k) laughs at these people, as if all their household goods lay in a basket, and a little hay, or straw: it is said of R. Siraeon, that when he went to the school, , "he carried a basket" on his shoulders (l); the gloss suggests, it was to sit upon; but a basket is not very proper for a seat; very likely it was for the above reason: such a custom will account for it, how such a number of baskets could be come at in the wilderness. <p>(h) Nicholas de Lyra, in Psal. lxxxi. 6.

Gfrörer, <span class="ital">Heiligth. u. Wahrh.</span> p. 171 ff.; Ammon, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. p. 217 f.), is inconsistent with the accounts of all the evangelists, and especially with that of the eye-witness John. Notwithstanding this, Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 234, thought that, even on exegetical principles, the plural <span class="greekheb">σημεῖα</span> in <a href="/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26</a> (but see note on this passage) would justify him in declining to rank the incident among the miracles; whilst Schenkel thinks he sees his way to an explanation by supposing what is scarcely possible, viz. that Jesus fed the multitude with a rich supply of <span class="ital">the bread of life from heaven</span>, which caused them to forget their <span class="ital">ordinary food</span>, though at the same time He devoutly consecrated for their use the provisions which they had brought with them, or had managed to procure for the present emergency. Weizsäcker likewise leaves the fact, which is supposed to underlie the present narrative, too much in a state of perplexing uncertainty; this element of fact, he thinks, must somehow correspond with the symbolism of the miracle, which is intended to teach us that there is no sphere in which the believer may not become a partaker of the fulness of Jesus’ blessing. Keim, adhering above all to the ideal explanation that the bread which Jesus provided was <span class="ital">spiritual</span> bread, and referring by way of parallel to the story of the manna and the case of Elisha, follows the Paulus-Schenkel line of interpretation, in conceding a residuum of historical fact, though he seems to doubt whether that residuum will be considered worth retaining. But to eliminate the element of <span class="ital">fact altogether</span>, is no less inconsistent with historical testimony. This, however, has been done by Strauss, who thereupon proceeds to account for the narrative, partly by tracing it to some original parable (Weisse, I. p. 510 ff.), partly by treating it as <span class="ital">a myth</span>, and deriving it from the types of the Old Testament (Exodus 16; <a href="/context/1_kings/17-8.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,...">1 Kings 17:8-16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm" title="And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.">2 Kings 4:42</a> ff.) and the popular Messianic ideas (<a href="/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?">John 6:30</a> f.), partly by supposing it to belong to the lofty sphere of <span class="ital">ideal legend</span> (Ewald, see note on <a href="/john/6-12.htm" title="When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.">John 6:12</a>), and partly by understanding it in a <span class="ital">symbolic</span> sense (Hase, de Wette). Such a mode of dealing with this incident is the result of denying the possibility of bringing a creative agency to bear upon dead, rather upon artificially prepared materials,—a possibility which is not rendered more conceivable by having recourse to the somewhat poor expedient of supposing that what was done may have been brought about by an accelerated natural process (Olshausen). But that such agency was actually brought to bear, is a historical fact so well established by the unanimous testimony of the evangelists, that we must be contented to accept it with all its incomprehensibility, and, in this case not less than in that of the changing of water into wine at Cana, abandon the hope of being able to get a clearer conception of the process of the miracle by the help of natural analogies. The symbolical <span class="ital">application</span>, that is, to the higher <span class="ital">spiritual</span> food, was made by our Lord Himself in <a href="/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26</a> ff.; but, in doing so, He takes the miraculous feeding with <span class="ital">material</span> bread as His historical basis and warrant. Moreover, the view of Origen, that it was <span class="greekheb">τῷ λόγῳ καὶ τῇ εὐλογίᾳ</span> that Jesus caused the bread to multiply, is greatly favoured by the fact that the circumstance of the thanksgiving is mentioned by the whole four evangelists, and above all by Luke’s expression: <span class="greekheb">εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/14-20.htm" title="And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.">Matthew 14:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">δώδεκα κοφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. is in appos. with <span class="greekheb">τὸ περισσεῦον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.

The Roman poet Juvenal describes a large provision-basket of this kind, together with a bundle of hay, as being part of the equipment of the Jewish mendicants who thronged the grove of Egeria at Rome.
