But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his disciples ... - The head was with Herodias.<p>The body, with pious care, they buried.<p>And went and told Jesus - This was done, probably, for the following reasons:<p>1. It was an important event, and one particularly connected with the work of Jesus. John was his forerunner, and it was important that he should be made acquainted with his death.<p>2. It is not unreasonable to suppose that in their affliction they came to him for consolation; nor is it improper in our affliction to follow their example, and go and tell Jesus.<p>3. Their master had been slain by a cruel king. Jesus was engaged in the same cause, and they probably supposed that he was in danger. They therefore came to warn him of it, and he <a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a> sought a place of safety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 14:12-21.

Theophylact says, his body was buried in Baste Caesarea, and that his head was first reposited in Emesesa. This was the last office of love to their master, and was done in respect and gratitude to him, and to show that they still abode by his doctrine; and was what decency and the belief of the resurrection of the dead, as well as the will of God, require should be done: <p>and went and told Jesus; that their master was dead, what kind of death he suffered, and by what means it was brought about; and how that they had interred him; and what Herod also had said of Jesus, that he was John risen from the dead. Their coming to Christ, and informing him of all this, show, that they were taught by their master to respect him as the Messiah, and believe in him, and adhere to him; and it is very likely that they continued with him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/14-12.htm" title="And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.">Matthew 14:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">πτῶμα</span>: carcase, used absolutely in this sense only in late writers.
