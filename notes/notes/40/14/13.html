This was, indeed, sufficiently shown by the eagerness with which the people followed Him into His retirement. Two other circumstances, named by the other Evangelists, tended to increase the crowd that thronged around Him. (1) The Twelve had just returned from their missionary circuit (<a href="/context/mark/6-30.htm" title="And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.">Mark 6:30-31</a>; <a href="/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.">Luke 9:10</a>), and it was, indeed, partly to give them, too, an interval of repose that He thus withdrew from His public work; and (2) the Passover was coming on (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>), and all the roads of Galilee were thronged with companies of pilgrims hastening to keep the feast at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Into a desert place.</span>—St. Luke names this as “a city called Bethsaida,” i.e., one of the two towns bearing that name on the coast of the Sea of Galilee. The name (which signified House of Fish=Fish-town) was a natural one for villages so placed, and the topography of all countries, our own included, presents too many instances of two or more places bearing the same name. with some distinctive epithet, to make the fact at all strange here. In St. Mark’s account the disciples sail, after the feeding of the five thousand, to the other Bethsaida (<a href="/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>); and as this appears in <a href="/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.

Perhaps tidings of John’s death had reached them before their return, and had caused them to hasten it. Be this as it may, it is probable that the distressing intelligence had thrown them into great consternation, and that our Lord retired into the desert with them with a view to allay it, and to give them an opportunity to indulge such meditations as were suitable to so awful a dispensation. Mark assigns also another reason of our Lord’s retreat on this occasion, namely, the continual hurry the apostles were kept in by the multitude, which thronged about Jesus to such a degree, that they <span class="ital">had not leisure so much as to eat </span>without interruption, and much less for religious retirement and recollection. Perhaps, likewise, by this retreat, our Lord proposed to shun Herod, who desired to see him, and might be contriving some method of obtaining an interview with him; for Jesus had perfect knowledge not only of the conversation which passed at the court of Galilee, but also of Herod’s thoughts and designs. <span class="ital">When the people heard</span> <span class="ital">thereof </span>— That is, heard to what place he was going, <span class="ital">they followed him on foot out of the cities </span>— They went after him by land, and travelled with such eagerness that they arrived at the place before him, having increased their numbers out of all the cities by which they passed. <span class="ital">And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude </span>— Much greater, it appears, than that which he had left at Capernaum.

The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls.

Of the death of John, and of the cruel usage he had met with; and particularly, that his fame had reached the court of Herod, and that he was talked of there, and said by Herod himself to be John the Baptist, that was risen from the dead; <p>he departed thence by ship, into a desert place apart; to avoid Herod, though not through fear of death; but because his time was not yet come: which may teach us, that it is lawful to shun dangers, when there is an opportunity; which may be done, without betraying truth, or sacrificing a good conscience. The other evangelists, Mark and Luke, assign another reason of this departure of Christ's, that it was upon the return of his disciples to him from their embassy; when having given him an account of what they had done, and taught, he judged it proper they should retire, and get some refreshment and rest; and both may very well be thought to be the reasons of this recess. At the same time that John's disciples brought him the news of their master's death, Christ's disciples return to him, with the account of the success of their ministry; who might not only be weary, and want refreshment, but be discouraged in their minds, at this instance of cruelty; wherefore Christ thought it necessary to retire, partly for his own safety, and partly for their ease; and that he might have an opportunity of fortifying their minds against all trials and persecutions they were to meet with: the place from whence he departed, was either Capernaum, his own country and city, or Nazareth, where we have lately heard of him; or some other place in Galilee, where he was, when John's disciples came to him: the place whither he went, was "a desert place"; and, as Luke says, "belonging to the city called Bethsaida", the city of Andrew and Peter, which lay on the other side of the sea of Galilee, or Tiberias; over which he went by ship, <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>. <p>And when the people had heard thereof; of his departure, and whither he went, <p>they followed him on foot out of their cities; such as Nazareth, Capernaum, Tiberias, and others; and passing the bridge at Jordan, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, they outwent the ship, and got thither before them, as Mark relates.

Since we find it stated immediately before that <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>, it is clear that the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀκούσας</span>, which is not further defined, can only be referred to the <span class="greekheb">ἀπήγγειλαν</span> of the preceding verse (Jerome, Augustine, Euth. Zigabenus, Erasmus, Maldonatus, de Wette, Ewald, Keim); while the reference to <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>, so frequent since Chrysostom’s time, is arbitrary, inasmuch as Matthew does not so much as hint at it. There is no anachronism here, occasioned by <a href="/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a> (Weiss in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1861, p. 40 f.). Matthew does not show such want of skill in the use he makes of Mark; neither does he go to work in so reckless and confused a way as Wilke and Holtzmann would have us believe. But the narrative runs somewhat as follows: (1) Matthew mentions that, at that time, Herod heard of Jesus, who was then in Nazareth, and said: This is John, and so on; (2) thereupon he gives an account of the death of John, to which reference has thus been made; (3) and lastly, he informs us in <a href="/matthew/14-12.htm" title="And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.">Matthew 14:12</a> f. how Jesus came to hear of this death, and how it led to His retiring into some solitude or other, to shelter Himself for a little from the persecution of Herod, which was probably being directed against Himself as well. From this it would appear that it must have been whilst Herod, who had just beheaded John, was indulging such dangerous thoughts regarding Jesus (<a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>), that the latter, through hearing from John’s own disciples of the fate of their master, so felt the necessity of being upon His guard against Herod’s hostility, that He took the precaution to retire lest His own death should be precipitated. Comp. <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-15.htm" title="But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;">Matthew 12:15</a>. It is clear from the shape in which the narrative is thus presented, that the beheading of John is to be understood as having taken place only a short time before the words of <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a> had been uttered, so that the terror that was awakened in Herod’s conscience when he heard of Jesus came on the back of his recent crime; but there was no reason why <a href="/context/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,...">Matthew 14:1-2</a> should have been regarded as a literary expedient devised merely for the purpose of introducing John once more into the narrative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖθεν</span>] <span class="ital">from the place</span>, where He had been staying when the intelligence reached Him; whether this was still Nazareth (<a href="/matthew/13-54.htm" title="And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?">Matthew 13:54</a>) or some other locality in Galilee, is determined by <span class="greekheb">ἐν πλοίῳ</span>, according to which it must have been a place <span class="ital">upon the sea-coast</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔρημον τόπον</span>] according to <a href="/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done.

In St John it prepares the way for the memorable discourse on the “Bread of Life.” St John also mentions, as a result of this miracle, the desire of the people “to take Him by force and make Him a king.” There is a question as to the locality of the miracle. St Luke says (ch. <a href="/matthew/9-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.">Matthew 9:10</a>) that Jesus “went aside privately into a desert place <span class="ital">belonging to a city called Bethsaida</span>.” St Mark (ch. <a href="/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>) describes the disciples as crossing to Bethsaida after the miracle. The general inference has been that there were two Bethsaidas; Bethsaida Julias, near the mouth of the Jordan (where the miracle is usually said to have taken place), and another Bethsaida, mentioned in the parallel passage in St Mark and possibly <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>. But the Sinaitic MS. omits the words in italics from Luke, and at <a href="/john/6-23.htm" title="(However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)">John 6:23</a> reads, “When, therefore, the boats came from Tiberias, which was nigh unto the place where they did eat bread.” If these readings be accepted, the scene of the miracle must be placed near Tiberias; the Bethsaida of Mark, to which the disciples crossed, will be the well-known Bethsaida Julias, and the other supposed Bethsaida will disappear even from the researches of travellers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/14-13.htm" title="When Jesus heard of it, he departed there by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.">Matthew 14:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀκούσς</span>, <span class="ital">having heard</span>) sc. those things which are mentioned in <a href="/context/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,...">Matthew 14:1-12</a>.[668]—<span class="greekheb">ἀνεχώρησεν</span>, <span class="ital">departed</span>) The murderer of the Baptist was unworthy to hear or see the Lord: see ch. <a href="/context/matthew/21-23.htm" title="And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?...">Matthew 21:23-27</a>.

But though St. John's account of it is on the whole independent, yet even this has expressions which are certainly due to the influence of the source used by the synoptists, or, less probably, of one or other of our present Gospels. The evangelist relates <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the occasion of the miracle (vers. 13, 140; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the preparation of the disciples (vers. 15-18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the miracle itself (vers. 19, 20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a summary statement of the numbers fed (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus heard of it</span> (cf. ver. 12<span class="accented">b</span>, note), <span class="cmt_word">he departed.</span> (For the form of the sentence, see <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thence by ship;</span> <span class="accented">in a boat</span> (Revised Version); <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Into a desert place apart.</span> Defined in <a href="/john/6-3.htm">John 6:3</a> as "the mountain;" in <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a> as "a city called Bethsaida." The spot appears to have been in part of the plain <span class="accented">El-Batiha</span>, which is at the northcast corner of the Sea of Galilee on the Gaulonitis side of the Jordan, and in which stood Bethsaida-Julias. <a href="/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a> implies that there was a second Bethsaida on the western side of the lake, which, though not alluded to by Josephus, is expressly spoken of in <a href="/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>, and is probably referred to in all the other passages of the New Testament where the name Bethsaida occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And when the people</span> (<span class="accented">the multitudes</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</span> The fact that it was near a feast time (<a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, the Passover, if the text be right; and cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 19, note) perhaps accounts for the multitudes being so large. Some at least would be on their way up to Jerusalem. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>On foot (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;)<p>Rev., by land in margin, which is better; for the contrast is between Jesus' journey by ship and that of the multitude by land. </body></html>
