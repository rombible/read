For the most part these mountain squalls died away gradually, and left the waves rough. Here the wind ceased in a moment, and ceased as their Lord entered the boat. And he gives a significant reason for their astonishment, “For they reflected not on the loaves, for their heart was hardened.” This was the later analysis which the disciples made of their feelings on that night. Had they understood all the divine creative energy which the miracle of the loaves involved, nothing afterwards, not even the walking on the waves, or the lulling of the storm, would have seemed startling to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/14-32.htm" title="And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased....">Matthew 14:32-33</a>. </span><span class="ital">When they were come into the ship, the wind ceased </span>— And that so suddenly that all in the ship were sensible it was the effect of Christ’s presence and power. He seems, also, according to <a href="/john/6-21.htm" title="Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.">John 6:21</a>, to have wrought another miracle at the same instant, for immediately on his entering the ship, <span class="ital">it was at the land! </span>These many wonderful miracles, succeeding each other so rapidly, greatly affected the minds of the disciples. <span class="ital">They were sore amazed, </span>says Mark, <span class="ital">in themselves, beyond measure, and wondered, </span>namely, at the astonishing power of their Master. <span class="ital">For they considered not the miracle of the loaves, </span>though so lately performed, and so wonderful, and though they had the sensible proof of it before their eyes in the baskets of fragments which they had taken with them into the ship; and perhaps had been talking of it before the storm came on; for their <span class="ital">heart was hardened, </span>and they were so stupified with their fear, that they did not reflect on that miracle. We need not, therefore, be surprised that they did not call to mind a similar exertion of his power, which they had beheld while they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes. <span class="ital">Then they that were in the ship </span>— Not only the disciples, but all others that were therein, <span class="ital">came and worshipped him </span>— Fell down at his feet in a rapture of wonder, devotion, and reverence, <span class="ital">saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God </span>— That is, the Messiah, and a divine person, possessed of an unlimited power over the whole creation. Though on many occasions formerly, Jesus had given equal, if not greater evidences of his power, the disciples did not, till now, make open confession of his dignity. It seems, when his miracles came to be thus multiplied, out especially when they followed upon one another so closely, the apostles were more deeply affected with them than by seeing him perform any single miracle.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they were come into the ship the wind ceased - Here was a new proof of the power of Jesus. He that has power over winds and waves has all power. John adds <a href="/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21</a> that the ship was immediately at the land whither they went; another proof, amid this collection of wonders, that the Son of God was with them. They came, therefore, and worshipped him, acknowledging him to be the Son of God. That is, they gave him homage, or honored him as the Son of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

The Arabic and Persic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel read, "when he ascended", or "was come into the ship"; but there is no doubt but Peter went with him into it, though the following effect is only to be ascribed to Christ's coming into the ship, and not to Peter's: <p>the wind ceased: from blowing with that fury and violence it did before, and there was a perfect calm; which gave equal proof of the divine power of Christ, as his walking upon the sea: he walked upon the sea whilst the wind was blowing hard, and the waves were tumultuous; he comes into the ship, and all is calm; both winds and sea obey him, who is Lord of both. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/14-32.htm" title="And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.">Matthew 14:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναβάντων αὐτῶν</span>: Jesus and Peter.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκόπασεν</span>: used in narrative of first sea-anecdote by <a href="/mark/4-39.htm" title="And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still.
