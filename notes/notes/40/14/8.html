These, or such like arguments, wrought up the young lady to such a pitch, that she not only consented to do as she was bidden, but became hearty in the cause: for, <a href="/mark/6-25.htm" title="And she came in straightway with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that you give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.">Mark 6:25</a>, <span class="ital">she came in straightway with haste, </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">ευθεως μετα σπουδης</span>, <span class="ital">immediately with eagerness; </span>and while all the guests sat mute, expecting what mighty thing would be asked, she demanded the holy Baptist’s head, as of greater value to her than the half of the kingdom. <span class="ital">Give me here </span>— Fearing if the king had time to consider, he would not do it; <span class="ital">John Baptist’s head in a charger </span>— <span class="greekheb">Επι πινακι</span>, a large dish, or bowl. <span class="ital">And the king was sorry — </span>Knowing that John was a good man; yet, <span class="ital">for the oath’s sake, </span>&c.

Such was the tenderness of the consciences of those Jewish rulers, who, while they were using their utmost efforts to take away, by a most unjust and cruel process, the life of Christ, yet scrupled going into the judgment-hall of Pilate, <span class="ital">lest they should be defiled! </span>But Herod was influenced also by a regard for those <span class="ital">who sat with him at meat. </span>Doubtless he was unwilling to appear either rash, or fickle, or false before them, as they were probably the first persons of his kingdom for rank and character. Thus out of a misplaced regard to his oath and his guests, this king committed a most unjust and cruel action, which will ever reflect the greatest dishonour upon his memory.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being before instructed of her mother - Not before she danced, but afterward, and before she made the request of Herod.<p>See <a href="/mark/6-24.htm">Mark 6:24</a>. The only appearance of what was right in the whole transaction was her honoring her mother by consulting her, but in this she only intended to accomplish the purposes of wickedness more effectively.<p>In a charger - The original word means a large platter on which food is placed. We should have supposed that she would have been struck with abhorrence at such a direction from her mother; but she seems to have been gratified. John, by his faithfulness, had offended the whole family, and here was ample opportunity for an adulterous mother and her dissolute child to gratify their resentment. It was customary for princes to require the heads of persons ordered for execution to be brought to them. For this there were two reasons:<p>1. To gratify their resentment - to feast their eyes on the proof that their enemy was dead; and,<p>2. To ascertain the fact that the sentence had been executed.<p>There is a similar instance in Roman history of a woman requiring the head of an enemy to be brought to her. Agrippina, the mother of Nero, who was afterward emperor, sent an officer to put to death Lollia Paulina, who had been her rival for the imperial dignity. When Lollia's head was brought to her, not knowing it at first, she examined it with her own hands until she perceived some particular feature by which the lady was distinguished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The power of the lust of malice and desire of revenge; surely Herodias might have prompted her to have asked something which might have done her more good than the blood of a holy and innocent man. The guilty soul is never at rest. John Baptist was a prisoner; she should not need have feared the influence of John’s word to have caused a divorce, but she cannot be at rest while John is alive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The great evil of wicked parents, and the contrary blessing of parents fearing God: the former, by commanding or persuading their children to sin, are great instruments towards their children’s damnation; the other, by their admonitions, precepts and instructions, great instruments of their salvation and eternal happiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

What request to make; for as Mark says, "she went forth" to her mother immediately, as soon as she had received the king's promise, and took advice of her, what she should ask; who bid her ask for the head of John the Baptist; and accordingly she went in, "straightway with haste unto the king", as the same evangelist observes, to take him at his word, and whilst he was in the mood; being urged and hastened on by her mother, who was eager to satisfy her revenge on John; and said, <p>give me here John Baptist's head in a charger: she desires his head, and this to be brought to her in a large dish, that her mother might be sure of his death; and have an opportunity of insulting that mouth and tongue, that had spoke against her incestuous marriage: and she desires to have it given "here", in that very place, at that very time, where, and while the company was together, who were witnesses of the king's promise and oath; and this she did, lest when the festival was over, and he was out of his cups, he should repent of his folly and rashness. The mother and daughter seem to be much alike, both for lasciviousness, revenge, and cruelty: and if what the historian says (w) be true, that this same person Salome, the daughter of Herodias, as she walked over a river which was frozen in the winter season, the ice broke, and she fell in, and the pieces of ice cut off her head; the "lex talionis", the law of retaliation, was righteously executed on her. <p>(w) Nicephorus, Hist. l. 1. c. 20. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/14-8.htm" title="And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.">Matthew 14:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">προβιβασθεῖσα</span>: not “before instructed,” as in A. V[87], but “brought to this point”; urged on. It should require a good deal of “educating” to bring a young girl to make such a grim request. But she had learnt her lesson well, and asked the Baptist’s head, as if she had been asking a favourite dish (<span class="greekheb">ὡς περί τινος ἐδέσματος διαλεγομένη</span>, Chrys., Hom. xlviii.). Kypke cites two instances of the rare use of the word in the sense of instruction.—<span class="greekheb">ὧδε</span> here and now, on the spot, <span class="greekheb">ἐξαυτῆς</span> in Mk. That was an essential part of the request. No time must be left for repentance.

There is no very great difficulty in supposing the chief men of Galilee, etc. (Mark), to have gone as far as Machaerus to pay their respects to Herod and to partake of the feast, but whether the statement in Josephus is accurate, and how, if it be so, it is to be reconciled with the preceding statement that Machaerus belonged to Aretas, are questions not easily answered (see Schurer, I. 2:26). <span class="cmt_word">John Baptist's head in a charger;</span> <span class="accented">in a charger the head of John the Baptist</span> (Revised Version).
