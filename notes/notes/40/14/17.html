The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions of Christ's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfy all that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have here but five loaves ... - These loaves were in the possession of a lad, or young man, who was with them, and were made of barley, <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a><p>It is possible that this lad was one in attendance on the apostles to carry their food, but it is most probable he was one who had provision to sell among the multitude.
