They were to sit down in companies of fifty or a hundred each, and thus the number of those who were fed became a matter of easy calculation. St. Mark, with a vivid picturesqueness, describes them as presenting the appearance of so many beds of flowers in a well-ordered garden. The bright colours of Eastern dress probably made the resemblance more striking than it would be with a like multitude so arranged among ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">Looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake.</span>—The act was natural and simple enough, the “saying grace” (St. John uses the word, “giving thanks”) of the head of a Jewish household as he gathered his family around him. The formulæ in such cases were commonly short and simple, like our own, such <span class= "ital">e.g.</span> as, “May God, the ever-blessed One, bless what He has given us.” Looking, however, to the teaching which followed the miracle, as in John 6, and to our Lord’s subsequent use at the Last Supper of the same words and acts, with others which gave them a new and higher meaning, we can hardly be wrong in thinking that as He now distributed the earthly bread to the hungering crowd, through the agency of His Apostles, there was present to His mind the thought that hereafter He would, through the same instrumentality, impart to souls that hungered after righteousness the gift of communion with Himself, that thus they might feed on the true Bread that cometh down from heaven.<p>It lies in the nature of the case, as a miracle of the highest order, that the process of multiplication is inconceivable in its details. Did each loaf, in succession, supply a thousand with food, and then come to an end, its place taken by another? Was the structure of the fishes, bone and skin and head, reproduced in each portion that was given to the guests at that great feast? We know not, and the Evangelists did not care to ask or to record. It was enough for them that the multitude “did all eat, and were filled.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/14-19.htm" title="And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude....">Matthew 14:19-21</a></span>. He <span class="ital">commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass </span>— Mark says, <span class="ital">by companies, </span>as we render the phrase <span class="greekheb">συμποσια</span>, <span class="greekheb">συμποσια</span>, which is literally, <span class="ital">companies, companies, </span>that is, <span class="ital">in separate companies. </span>These, as appears by comparing <a href="/mark/6-39.htm" title="And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.">Mark 6:39</a> with <a href="/luke/9-14.htm" title="For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.">Luke 9:14</a>, consisted some of fifty persons, some of a hundred, according as the ground would admit. Our Lord probably ordered them to be ranged in this manner that they might sit compactly, that their numbers might appear, that the meat might be divided among them with ease, and that none might be neglected in the distribution. And no sooner did Christ signify his will to the disciples, and they intimated it to the multitude, than they all instantly did as they were ordered: so great an opinion had they of Christ’s wisdom and power! Though they thus sat on the ground, under no canopy but the sky, and had only barley bread, and, as it seems, cold or dried fishes to eat, and probably nothing but water to drink; yet, as Mr. Henry truly and beautifully observes, there was more real grandeur displayed by the Master of this feast than by Ahasuerus, in that <span class="ital">royal feast </span>which was intended to <span class="ital">show the riches of his glorious kingdom, </span>and <span class="ital">the honour of his excellent majesty. And took the five loaves, </span>&c. — Thus acting like the master of a family among the Jews, who was wont to take the bread into his hands and to give thanks to God, before any at the table was permitted to eat any thing: <span class="ital">And looking up to heaven </span>— With great reverence and affection; <span class="ital">he blessed </span>— That is, says Dr. Whitby, with whom agree many other commentators, <span class="ital">he blessed, </span>or gave thanks to <span class="ital">God, </span>the liberal giver of all good, for his infinite beneficence in furnishing food to all flesh, and for the power he had conferred on him of relieving mankind by his miracles, particularly that which he was about to work, and which perhaps he prayed for, to raise the attention of the multitude, as we find him doing before the resurrection of Lazarus, <a href="/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41</a>. They apprehend that his looking up to heaven when he blessed, shows that his blessing was directed to God, and that it imported a thanksgiving for his great goodness. Accordingly John expresses it by <span class="greekheb">ευχαριστησας</span>, <span class="ital">having given thanks, </span>he distributed, &c. It must be observed, however, that most commentators refer the expression, <span class="ital">he blessed, </span>to the loaves and fishes, because Luke says expressly, <span class="greekheb">ευλογησεν αυτους</span>, <span class="ital">he blessed them; </span>that is, he commanded upon them that singular blessing by which they were multiplied in the distribution. Thus God is said to bless the springing of the corn, <a href="/psalms/65-10.htm" title="You water the ridges thereof abundantly: you settle the furrows thereof: you make it soft with showers: you bless the springing thereof.">Psalm 65:10</a>. <span class="ital">And gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude </span>— “It is not to be supposed,” says Macknight, “that twelve persons could put first a piece of bread, and then a piece of fish, into the hands of five thousand men, besides the women and children, who were all fed with such expedition, that, notwithstanding the thing was not so much as proposed to the disciples till about three, all was over by five o’clock in the afternoon, as may be gathered from <a href="/john/6-16.htm" title="And when even was now come, his disciples went down to the sea,">John 6:16</a>, where see the note. It is natural, therefore, to conclude, that, in distributing the meat, the disciples used the most expeditious method, putting, by their Master’s direction, the bread first, and after that the fish, into the hands of those only who sat at the ends of the ranks, with orders to give it to their companions. On this supposition, the meat must have extended its dimensions, not in our Lord’s hands only, but in the hands of the multitude likewise, continuing to swell till there was a greater quantity than they, who held it, could make use of; so that breaking off what was sufficient for themselves, they gave the remainder to the persons next them, who, in like manner, saw the bread and fish swell in their own hands till they also had enough and to spare. The meat being thus created among the hands of the multitude, and before their eyes, as long as there was a single person to be fed, they <span class="ital">did all eat, </span>and <span class="ital">were filled, </span>to their unspeakable astonishment. In this manner did he who is the Bread of Life feed about ten thousand people, (for doubtless the women and children were as numerous as the men,) with five loaves and two small fishes, giving a magnificent proof, not only of his goodness, but of his creating power. For after all had eaten to satiety, the disciples, at Jesus’s command, (see note on <a href="/john/6-12.htm" title="When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.">John 6:12</a>,)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces of meat, each disciple a basket, in which there must have been much more than the quantity at first set before the Lord to divide. The stupendous miracle, therefore, without all doubt, was conspicuous, not to the disciples only, who, carrying each his basket in his hand, had an abiding, sensible demonstration of its truth, but to every individual guest at this divine feast, who had all felt themselves delighted, filled, refreshed, and strengthened by the meal. This being one of the most astonishing, and at the same time the most extensively convincing of all the miracles Jesus performed during the course of his ministry, every one of the evangelists has recorded it; and, which is remarkable, it is the only one found in each of their histories.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:13-21 When Christ and his word withdraw, it is best for us to follow, seeking the means of grace for our souls before any worldly advantages. The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions of Christ's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfy all that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he commanded the multitude to sit down - In the original it is "to recline" on the grass, or to lie as they did at their meals.<p>The Jews never sat, as we do, at meals, but reclined or lay at length.

Mark and Luke add that they reclined in companies, by hundreds and by fifties.<p>And looking up to heaven, he blessed - Luke adds, he blessed "them;" that is, the loaves. The word "to bless" means, often, to give thanks; sometimes to pray for a blessing; that is, to pray for the divine favor and friendship; to pray that what we do may meet his approbation. In seeking a blessing on our food, it means that we pray that it may be made nourishing to our bodies; that we may have proper gratitude to God, the giver, for providing for our wants; and that we may remember the Creator while we partake the bounties of his providence. Our Saviour always sought a blessing on his food. In this he was an example for us. What he did we should do. It is right thus to seek the blessing of God. He provides for us; he daily opens his hand and satisfies our wants, and it is proper that we should render suitable acknowledgments for his goodness.<p>The custom among the Jews was universal. The form of prayer which they used in the time of Christ has been preserved by their writers, the Talmudists. It is this: "Blessed be thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, who hast produced this food and this drink from the earth and the vine."<p>And brake - The loaves of bread, among the Jews, were made thin and brittle, and were therefore broken and not cut.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 14:12-21.
