But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Herod had laid hold on John ... - See <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/3-19.htm">Luke 3:19-20</a>. This Herodias was a granddaughter of Herod the Great. She was first married to Herod Philip, by whom she had a daughter, Salome, probably the one that danced and pleased Herod. Josephus says that this marriage of Herod Antipas with Herodias took place while he was on a journey to Rome. He stopped at his brother's; fell in love with his wife; agreed to put away his own wife, the daughter of Aretas, King of Petraea; and Herodias agreed to leave her own husband and live with him. They were living, therefore, in adultery; and John, in faithfulness, though at the risk of his life, had reproved them for their crimes. Herod was guilty of two crimes in this act:<p>1. Of "adultery," since she was the wife of another man.<p>2. Of "incest," since she was a near relation, and such marriages were expressly forbidden, <a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Philip and this Herod were both sons of Herod the Great, but not by the same woman; Philip was born of Cleopatra of Jerusalem, and Herod Antipas of Malthace, a Samaritan (f); so that Philip was his brother by his father's side, but not by his mother's; the Evangelist Mark adds, "for he had married her": the case was this, Herod being sent for to Rome, called at his brother Philip's by the way, where he fell into an amorous intrigue with his wife, and agreed, upon his return, to take her with him and marry her; as he accordingly did, and divorced his own wife, who was daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia Petraea; which occasioned a war between Herod and his wife's father, in which the former was beaten (g), <p>(d) Joseph.

Possibly, also, a reference to John being safer there from the designs of Herodias (<a href="/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>). Anyhow, notice the stages in Herod's action - capture, binding, imprisonment in a place where he was quite out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">For Herodias' sake.</span> John was imprisoned, according to the New Testament, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a punishment for his rebuke of Herod; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to protect him from Herodias' vengeance. (On the statement by Josephus, that it was for political reasons, see <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">His brother Philip's wife.</span> According to Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:05. 4), the first husband of Herodias was "Herod," son of Herod the Great by Mariamne the high priest's daughter, and the daughter of Herodias, Salome, married Philip the tetrarch, who was also the son of Herod the Great by Cleopatra of Jerusalem. Hence many critics (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald; Schurer, I. 2:22) suppose the account in Matthew and Mark to be mistaken, and due to a confusion of Herodias with her daughter. But, although it is curious that two sons of Herod the Great should have been called Philip, yet, in view of their being by different mothers, it cannot be pronounced impossible  ("Antipas" and "Antipater" are <span class="accented">not</span> precisely identical). Besides, Herod the son of Mariamne would probably have had some other name than that of his father alone. It is noticeable that, in the same context, Josephus speaks also of Antipas by the name Herod only. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Put him in prison<p>(&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;). Lit., "put him away or aside" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;). This prison was the fortress of Machaerus on the east side of the Dead Sea, almost on a line with Bethlehem, above the gorge which divided the Mountains of Abarim from the range of Pisgah. Perched on an isolated cliff at the end of a narrow ridge, encompassed with deep ravines, was the citadel. At the other end of this ridge Herod built a great wall, with towers two hundred feet high at the corners; and within this inclosure, a magnificent palace, with colonnades, baths, cisterns, arsenals - every provision, in short, for luxury and for defence against siege. The windows commanded a wide and grand prospect, including the Dead Sea, the course of the Jordan, and Jerusalem. In the detached citadel, probably in one of the underground dungeons, remains of which may still be seen, was the prison of John. "We return through what we regard as the ruins of the magnificent castle-palace of Herod, to the highest and strongest part of the defences - the eastern keep or the citadel, on the steep slope, one hundred and fifty yards up. The foundations of the walls all around, to the height of a yard or two above the ground, are still standing. As we clamber over them to examine the interior, we notice how small this keep is: exactly one hundred yards in diameter. There are scarcely any remains of it left. A well of great depth, and a deep, cemented cistern, with the vaulting of the roof still complete, and - of most terrible interest to us - two dungeons, one of them deep down, its sides scarcely broken in, ' with small holes still visible in the masonry where staples of wood and iron had once been fixed!' As we look down into its hot darkness, we shudder in realizing that this terrible keep had, for nigh ten months, been the prison of that son of the free wilderness, the bold herald of the coming kingdom, the humble, earnest, self-denying John the Baptist" (Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus"). </body></html>
