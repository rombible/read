The manifestation of divine power in the works of healing coincided with the divine wisdom revealed in the new teaching.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:34-36 Whithersoever Christ went, he was doing good. They brought unto him all that were diseased. They came humbly beseeching him to help them. The experiences of others may direct and encourage us in seeking for Christ. As many as touched, were made perfectly whole. Those whom Christ heals, he heals perfectly. Were men more acquainted with Christ, and with the diseased state of their souls, they would flock to receive his healing influences. The healing virtue was not in the finger, but in their faith; or rather, it was in Christ, whom their faith took hold upon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Land of Gennesaret - This region was in Galilee, on the west side of the Sea of Tiberias; and in this land was situated Capernaum, to which he had directed his disciples to go.<p>The hem of his garment - That is, the fringe or border on the outer garment. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14</a><p>1. We learn from this chapter the power of conscience, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1-4</a>. Herod's guilt was the only reason why he thought John the Baptist had risen. At another time he would altogether have disbelieved it. Consciousness of guilt will at some period infallibly torment a man.<p>2. The duty of faithfulness, <a href="/matthew/14-4.htm">Matthew 14:4</a>. John reproved Herod at the hazard of his life, and he died for it; but he had the approbation of conscience and of God. So will all who do their duty. Here was an example of fidelity to all ministers of religion. They are not to fear the face of man, however rich, or mighty, or wicked.<p>3. The righteous will command the respect of the wicked. Herod was a wicked man, but he respected John and feared him, <a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>. The wicked profess to despise religion, and many really do; but their consciences tell them that religion is a good thing. In times of trial they will sooner trust Christians than others. In sickness and death they are often glad to see them and hear them pray, and desire the comfort which they have; and, like Balsam, say, "Let me die the death of the righteous," <a href="/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>. No person, young or old, is ever the less really esteemed for being a Christian.<p>4. People are often restrained from great sins by mere selfish motives, as Herod was by the love of popularity, <a href="/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>. Herod would have put John to death long before had it not been that he feared the people. His constantly desiring to do it was a kind of prolonged murder. God will hold men guilty for desiring to do evil; and will not justify them if they are restrained, not by the fear of him, but by the fear of people.<p>5. We see the effect of what is called the principle of honor, <a href="/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>. It was in obedience to this that Herod committed murder. This is the principle of duelling and war. No principle is so foolish and wicked. The great mass of people disapprove of it. The wise and good have always disapproved of it. This principle of honor is usually the mere love of revenge. It is often the fear of being laughed at. It produces evil. God cannot and will not love it. The way to prevent duels and murders is to restrain the passions and cultivate a spirit of meekness and forgiveness when young; that is, to come early under the full influence of the gospel.<p>6. People should be cautious about promises, and especially about oaths. Herod made a foolish promise, and confirmed it by a wicked oath, <a href="/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>. Promises should not be made without knowing what is promised, and without knowing that it will be right to perform them. Oaths are always wicked except when made before a magistrate, and on occasions of real magnitude. The practice of profane and common swearing, like that of Herod, is always foolish and wicked, and sooner or later will bring people into difficulty.<p>7. Amusements are often attended with evil consequences, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-6.htm">Matthew 14:6-11</a>. The dancing of a frivolous and profligate girl was the means of the death of one of the holiest of men. Dancing, balls, splendid parties, and theaters are thought by many to be innocent; but they are a profitless waste of time. They lead to forgetfulness of God. They nourish passion and sensual desires. They often lead to the seduction and ruin of the innocent. They are unfit for dying creatures. From the very midst of such scenes the "happy" may go to the judgment bar of God. How poor a preparation to die! How dreadful the judgment seat to such!<p>8. Jesus will take care of the poor, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14-21</a>. He regarded the temporal as well as the spiritual needs of the people. Rather than see them suffer, he worked a miracle to feed them. So, rather than see us suffer, God is daily doing what man cannot do. He causes the grain to grow; he fills the land, and seas, and air with living creatures; nay, he provides in desert places for the support of man. How soon would all people and beasts die if he did not put forth continued power and goodness for the supply of our wants!<p>9. It is the duty of Christians to be solicitous about the temporal wants of the poor, <a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15</a>. They are with us. By regarding them, and providing for them, we have an opportunity of showing our attachment to Christ, and our resemblance to God, who continually does good.<p>10. A blessing should be sought on our enjoyments, <a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>. It is always right to imitate Christ. It is right to acknowledge our dependence on God, and in the midst of mercies to pray that we may not forget the Giver.<p>11. We see the duty of economy. The Saviour, who had power to create worlds by a word, yet commanded to take up the fragments, that nothing might be lost, <a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12</a>. Nothing that God has created and given to us should be wasted.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.
