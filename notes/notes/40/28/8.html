The discrepancies, such as they are, at any rate, show that the narratives were independent. The best solution of the questions presented by a comparison of the Gospel narrative at this stage is that Mary Magdalene ran eagerly to tell Peter and John, leaving the other Mary and Joanna (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>), and then followed in the rear of the two disciples (<a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>).

On the first day of the first week God commanded the light to shine out of darkness. On this day did He who is the Light of the world, shine out of the darkness of the grave; and this day is from henceforward often mentioned in the New Testament, as the day which Christians religiously observed in solemn assemblies, to the honour of Christ. Our Lord Jesus could have rolled back the stone by his own power, but he chose to have it done by an angel. The resurrection of Christ, as it is the joy of his friends, so it is the terror and confusion of his enemies. The angel encouraged the women against their fears. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid. Fear not ye, for his resurrection will be your consolation. Our communion with him must be spiritual, by faith in his word. When we are ready to make this world our home, and to say, It is good to be here, then let us remember our Lord Jesus is not here, he is risen; therefore let our hearts rise, and seek the things that are above. He is risen, as he said. Let us never think that strange which the word of Christ has told us to expect; whether the sufferings of this present time, or the glory that is to be revealed. It may have a good effect upon us, by faith to view the place where the Lord lay. Go quickly. It was good to be there, but the servants of God have other work appointed. Public usefulness must be chosen before the pleasure of secret communion with God. Tell the disciples, that they may be comforted under their present sorrows. Christ knows where his disciples dwell, and will visit them. Even to those at a distance from the plenty of the means of grace, he will graciously manifest himself. The fear and the joy together quickened their pace. The disciples of Christ should be forward to make known to each other their experiences of communion with their Lord; and should tell others what God has done for their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they departed quickly - Joyful at the "news," and wishing to impart it to all, they fled to find the disciples, and to tell them that the Lord was risen.<p>With fear and great joy - Fear because of:<p>1. the wonderful scenes which they had witnessed the stone rolled away, and the presence of an angel;<p>2. a confused state of mind, apprehensive, perhaps, that it might not, after all, be true.<p>The news was too good to be credited at once, yet they had sufficient faith in it to fill them with great and unexpected joy.

And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Luke saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/24-3.htm" title="And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus....">Luke 24:3-11</a></span>, <span class="ital">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered his words, and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John saith, of Mary Magdalene only, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew in this relation omits many things more distinctly related by the other evangelists. When the women came to the sepulchre, they first entered in; so saith Mark and Luke. It was within that they saw the angel, habited as it were in a long white, shining garment. They were affrighted, (as we naturally are upon apparitions), they bowed down their faces to the earth. The angel bids them not to fear, he knew that they sought Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Why seek ye the living among the dead? he is not here, but is risen; </span> showeth to them the place where his body was laid; minds them of Christ’s words to them in Galilee, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/18-23.htm" title="Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, which would take account of his servants.">Matthew 18:23</a></span>; bids them go tell his disciples (Mark adds, <span class="ital">and Peter</span>) that he was going before them into Galilee, and that there they should see him, as he had said unto them, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/26-32.htm" title="But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.">Matthew 26:32</a> <a href="/mark/14-28.htm" title="But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.">Mark 14:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They departed quickly from the sepulchre</span> (as Matthew saith) <span class="bld">with fear and great joy; </span> Mark saith, trembling and amazed.

The cause of their sudden joy was the news that he was risen, told them by the angel. It appeareth that their joy was but a sudden flash of passion, not rising from the certainty of their souls as to the truth of what they heard, because they said to the disciples, that they did not believe it, but upon second thoughts concluded that somebody had removed our Saviour’s body: neither did the apostles themselves believe it, as appeareth by Luke; he saith they looked upon it as an idle tale. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John saith expressly, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/20-9.htm" title="For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.">John 20:9</a></span>, <span class="ital">As yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead:</span> they knew it notionally, but they did not give a firm and a fixed assent to it, they did not believe it. It was not, it seemeth, in the power of their wills to believe this article of Christ’s resurrection; for as they had a Divine revelation of the thing from Christ himself, so we cannot but think they had mind and good will enough to believe it. But God had not given them the power of faith as to this point. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre,.... Or "they went out from it", as it may be rendered, and as it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm">Mark 16:8</a>, which shows, that they went into the sepulchre upon the invitation of the angel, and saw the place where the Lord lay; and here it was the angel gave them their instructions, and errand to the disciples; which as soon as they received, they quitted the sepulchre in all haste, partly in obedience to the angel's orders, and partly through surprise and fear; for Mark says, "they fled from the sepulchre", <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm">Mark 16:8</a>, as persons terrified and affrighted: and it is added here, <p>with fear and great joy: a mixture of both these; with fear and dread, because of the vision they had seen, and with joy at the news of Christ's resurrection; and yet in this their faith might not be so confirmed, as to have no doubt about it: they might fear the body was taken away, and removed to some other place, and that this they had seen might be a deception and a delusion. However, between both joy and fear, they set out, <p>and did run to bring his disciples word; as Mary Magdalene ran to Peter, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>, nor is running unusual for women, or unbecoming them on certain occasions; see <a href="/genesis/24-20.htm">Genesis 24:20</a>.
