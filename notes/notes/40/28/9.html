It was the natural attitude of a suppliant servant before his master (<a href="/matthew/18-26.htm" title="The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.">Matthew 18:26</a>). It was, perhaps, not till later that the disciples were led to feel that the attitude was one that was due to God and to the Man Christ Jesus, and to no other of the sons of men (<a href="/acts/10-26.htm" title="But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.">Acts 10:26</a>) or angels (<a href="/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>).

And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him....">Matthew 28:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">And as they went </span>— Or, <span class="ital">as they were going, </span>on their way, <span class="ital">Jesus met them </span>— These zealous, good women not only heard the first tidings of their Lord, but had the first sight of him after his resurrection. The angel directed those that would see him to go to Galilee; and gave none any hopes of seeing him till they came thither. But Jesus is often better to his people than his word; but never worse; he often anticipates, but never frustrates their believing expectations: <span class="ital">saying, All hail! — </span>The old English form of salutation is here used, wishing <span class="ital">all health, </span>as the expression signifies. The Greek word here used, <span class="greekheb">χαιρετε</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">Rejoice; </span>and answers to the form used by the Hebrews, <span class="ital">Peace be unto you. They came and held him by the feet </span>— As soon as they saw that it was Jesus, beginning to recover from their fear, they drew near to him, and in the most respectful manner, and with the greatest reverence, prostrated themselves before him, and embraced his feet, thus manifesting as well the affection they had to him as the greatness of the joy with which they were transported. This favour of embracing his knees Jesus granted to these women, because the angel’s words having strongly impressed their minds with the notion of his resurrection, they might have taken his appearing for an illusion of their own imagination, had he not permitted them to handle him, and convince themselves by the united report of their senses. <span class="ital">Then said Jesus, Be not afraid </span>— Fear not being imposed upon by these repeated notices of my resurrection; nor fear any hurt, either by the appearance of a messenger from heaven, or of one coming from the dead; for the news brought you, though strange, is both true and replete with comfort. <span class="ital">Go tell my brethren </span>— For I still own them as such, though they so lately disowned and forsook me. John (<a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>) records our Lord’s using similar language to Mary Magdalene alone, when he sent her to them with the same message. Doubtless these affectionate friends of Christ were exact in reporting this circumstance, that their injured Lord called them his <span class="ital">brethren </span>still: and both Matthew and John, to whom the glad tidings were immediately brought, felt it strike so powerfully on their hearts, that they could not but record it. He, no doubt, saw it needful to give it them now to encourage them, knowing how much ashamed and distressed they were for having deserted him in his sufferings. And the appellation was now peculiarly consolatory, not only in that it assured them that they were freely forgiven for their past cowardice, but also in that it opened before them a prospect of such glory and felicity as, it appears, they had before no conception of. For as Jesus was now, by his resurrection, declared with power to be the Son of God and heir of all things, by styling his disciples his brethren, he assures them that they were children of God too, and joint heirs with him of all his joys and glories. By this appellation he also pointed out their duty to each other; for, being all his brethren, they were, of consequence, brethren one to another, and must <span class="ital">love as brethren. </span>And as his owning them for his brethren put a great honour upon them, so it also gave them an example of humility in the midst of that honour.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:9,10 God's gracious visits usually meet us in the way of duty; and to those who use what they have for others' benefit, more shall be given. This interview with Christ was unexpected; but Christ was nigh them, and still is nigh us in the word. The salutation speaks the good-will of Christ to man, even since he entered upon his state of exaltation. It is the will of Christ that his people should be a cheerful, joyful people, and his resurrection furnishes abundant matter for joy. Be not afraid. Christ rose from the dead, to silence his people's fears, and there is enough in that to silence them. The disciples had just before shamefully deserted him in his sufferings; but, to show that he could forgive, and to teach us to do so, he calls them brethren. Notwithstanding his majesty and purity, and our meanness and unworthiness, he still condescends to call believers his brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as they went ...

Now the women, according to our history, receive the reward of their faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail!</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">Rejoice ye!</span> This is not the usual Eastern salutation, "Peace be unto you!" but one that came with peculiar significance on their lately sorrow-stricken hearts. So he had said to his apostles, "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>), and now he made good his word. This is the only one of Christ's appearances in Jerusalem or its neighbourhood. that St. Matthew relates. <span class="cmt_word">They came and</span>  <span class="cmt_word">held him by the feet</span> (<span class="accented">took hold of his feet</span>). As soon as they saw him, they went to him with glad surprise, and yet with such awe, that they could only fall down before him and tenderly clasp his feet. He had appeared before this to Mary Magdalene (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>), but had not permitted her to touch him because he had not yet ascended to the Father (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), implying thereby either that she would have other opportunities of holding converse with him, as he was not going to leave the earth immediately, and she must not detain him now; or, more probably, that the spiritual body demanded, not the touch of earthly affection, but the attitude of awe and reverence, and that all future contact would be supernatural and spiritual, realizing his presence after a heavenly and supersensuous manner by faith. But these women clung to Christ with something higher than natural, earthly affection, acknowledging his superhumanity, and he allowed them, like Thomas, to assure themselves of his corporeity by touch as well as sight. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> They remained at his feet in profound adoration. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/28.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All hail (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The ordinary Greek form of situation. </body></html>
