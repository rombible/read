The act, as has been said, was not new in itself, but it seems certain that our Lord’s manifestations of His Presence after the Resurrection had made the faith of the disciples stronger and clearer (comp. <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>), and so the act acquired a new significance.<p><span class= "bld">Some doubted.</span>—It seems hard at first to conceive how those who had been present in the upper chamber at Jerusalem (<a href="/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-26</a>) could still feel doubt; but the narrative of <a href="/john/21-4.htm" title="But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.">John 21:4</a> throws some light upon it. There was something mysterious and supernatural in the manifestation of the glorified body—outlines, at first indistinct and scarcely recognised, and then the whole form seen as it had been seen in life. The more devoted and loving disciples were probably, here as before, the first to recognise their Lord. Others questioned whether it was a phantom (comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/14-26.htm" title="And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.">Matthew 14:26</a>) or a reality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/28-17.htm" title="And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.">Matthew 28:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">When they saw him, they worshipped — </span>The greatest part were so fully convinced that the person they saw was their Master, that they worshipped him; <span class="ital">but some doubted </span>— But with respect to a few, their joy, on seeing the Lord, put them into a kind of perturbation, and their desire that it might be him. made them afraid it was not. This reason is assigned by Luke for the unbelief of some on a former occasion, <a href="/matthew/24-41.htm" title="Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.">Matthew 24:41</a>. <span class="ital">They believed not for joy and wonder; </span>and therefore it may fitly be offered to account for the unbelief of others on this. “Besides, the thing is agreeable to nature, men being commonly afraid to believe what they vehemently wish, lest they should indulge themselves in a false joy, which they must soon lose. Hence the saying in Terence, <span class="ital">Misera mens incredula est: quo plus cupio, minus credo. </span>‘My anxious mind is incredulous: the more I wish, the less I believe.’ The case of the disciples, whose desire and joy made them doubt the truth of what they saw, may be illustrated by the instance of the states of Greece and Asia, whose joy and surprise on hearing a Roman herald declare them all free, and at liberty to use their own laws, had a similar effect upon them, as the story is beautifully told by Livy, lib. 33. cap. 35.” The Prussian editors, however, who are followed by some others, render the clause thus, — <span class="ital">even those who had doubted. </span>“Probably at this appearance the apostles received orders to return to Jerusalem; for from <a href="/context/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:...">Acts 1:3-12</a>, compared with <a href="/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50</a>, it is plain that our Lord’s discourses, before his ascension, related <a href="/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15</a>, and <a href="/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>, were delivered in or near to the city. Besides, he ascended from the mount of Olives, as we shall see in the subsequent evangelists. Wherefore, if the orders for the apostles to repair to Jerusalem were not given at this appearance, Jesus must have showed himself again, which indeed is not impossible, as it is evident from <a href="/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.">1 Corinthians 15:7</a> that he showed himself somewhere, after his appearance to the five hundred brethren, to the Apostle James alone, though none of the evangelists have given the least hint of this appearance. Among the apostles there were two persons of that name: one the brother of John, who was killed by Herod, another the brother or cousin of Jesus. Perhaps it was to James the brother of John that our Lord appeared after his resurrection. His being to suffer martyrdom so early, might make this special favour necessary.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:16-20 This evangelist passes over other appearances of Christ, recorded by Luke and John, and hastens to the most solemn; one appointed before his death, and after his resurrection. All that see the Lord Jesus with an eye of faith, will worship him. Yet the faith of the sincere may be very weak and wavering. But Christ gave such convincing proofs of his resurrection, as made their faith to triumph over doubts. He now solemnly commissioned the apostles and his ministers to go forth among all nations. The salvation they were to preach, is a common salvation; whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit; all are welcome to Christ Jesus. Christianity is the religion of a sinner who applies for salvation from deserved wrath and from sin; he applies to the mercy of the Father, through the atonement of the incarnate Son, and by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and gives up himself to be the worshipper and servant of God, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons but one God, in all his ordinances and commandments. Baptism is an outward sign of that inward washing, or sanctification of the Spirit, which seals and evidences the believer's justification. Let us examine ourselves, whether we really possess the inward and spiritual grace of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, by which those who were the children of wrath become the children of God. Believers shall have the constant presence of their Lord always; all days, every day. There is no day, no hour of the day, in which our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with his ministers; if there were, in that day, that hour, they would be undone. The God of Israel, the Saviour, is sometimes a God that hideth himself, but never a God at a distance. To these precious words Amen is added. Even so, Lord Jesus, be thou with us and all thy people; cause thy face to shine upon us, that thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They worshipped him - Paid him honour as the Messiah.<p>But some doubted - As, for example, Thomas, <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>. The disciples had not expected his resurrection; they were therefore slow to believe. The mention of their doubting shows that they were honest men that they were not easily imposed on that they had not previously agreed to affirm that he had risen - that they were convinced only by the strength of the evidence. Their caution in examining the evidence; their slowness to believe; their firm conviction after all their doubts; and their willingness to show their conviction even by their "death," is most conclusive proof that they were "not" deceived in regard to the fact of his resurrection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The other evangelists mention several other appearances of Christ, which we shall consider when we come to them. This was in Galilee, upon Christ’s appointment either before or after his resurrection, we cannot certainly say when, or how.

This particular is added by means of <span class="greekheb">οἱ δέ</span>, which, however, is not preceded by a corresponding <span class="greekheb">οἱ μέν</span> before <span class="greekheb">προσεκύνησαν</span>, because this latter applied to the majority, whereas the doubters, who did not prostrate themselves, were only the exception. Had Matthew’s words been: <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν προσεκύνησαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν</span>, he would thus have represented the eleven as divided into two co-ordinate parts, into as nearly as possible two halves, and so have stated something different from what was intended. This is a case precisely similar to that of the <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ ἐῤῥάπισαν</span> of <a href="/matthew/26-67.htm" title="Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,">Matthew 26:67</a>, where, in like manner, the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐκολάφισαν αὐτόν</span> (without <span class="greekheb">οἱ μέν</span>) represents what was done by <span class="ital">the majority</span>. “Quibus in locis primum <span class="ital">universa res</span> ponitur, deinde partitio nascitur, quae ostendit, priora quoque verba <span class="ital">non de universa causa</span> jam accipi posse,” Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 358.

Again, as matter of course, we must not think of predicating the <span class="greekheb">προσεκύνησαν</span> of the <span class="ital">doubters</span> as well, which would be psychologically absurd (only after his doubts were <span class="ital">overcome</span>, did Thomas exclaim: <span class="greekheb">ὁ κυριός μου κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός μου</span>!). Fritzsche (comp. Theophylact, Grotius, and Markland in <span class="ital">Eur. Suppl</span>. p. 326) attempts to obviate this objection by understanding <span class="greekheb">ἐδίστασαν</span> in a <span class="ital">pluperfect</span> sense (they <span class="ital">had doubted</span> before they saw Jesus); an expedient, however, of the same arbitrary nature as before (comp. on <a href="/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>), and such as no reader of our passage (with <span class="greekheb">προσεκύνησαν</span> before him) would have suspected to be at all necessary. <span class="ital">Others</span>, in spite of the plain and explicit statements of Matthew, and in order to free the <span class="ital">eleven</span> from the imputation of doubt, have here turned to account the <span class="ital">five hundred brethren</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a> (Calovius, Michaelis, Ebrard, Lange), or the <span class="ital">seventy disciples</span> (Kuinoel), and attributed the <span class="greekheb">ἐδίστασαν</span> to <span class="ital">certain of these!</span> Others, again, have resorted to <span class="ital">conjecture</span>; Beza, for example, thinks that for <span class="greekheb">οἱ δέ</span> we might read <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span>; Bornemann, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

At the same time, it is not enough to appeal to the fact that “nothing that was subject to death any longer adhered to the living One” (Hase), but, in accordance with the evangelic accounts of the appearing and sudden vanishing of the risen Lord, and of the whole relation in which He stood to His disciples and His disciples to Him, we must assume some <span class="ital">change</span> in the bodily organism and outward aspect of Jesus, a mysterious transformation of His whole person, an <span class="ital">intermediate phase of existence</span> between <span class="ital">the</span> bodily nature as formerly existing and the glorified state into which He passed at the moment of the ascension,—a phase of existence, however, of which it is impossible for us to form any distinct conception, for this is a case where analogy and experience alike fail us. His body did not retain, as did those of Jairus’ daughter, the young man of Nain, and Lazarus, exactly the same essential nature as belonged to it before death, but still it was not as yet the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>), though it was certainly immortal, a fact which of itself would necessarily involve the very essential change which came over it; comp. also Bleek.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/28.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/28-17.htm" title="And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.">Matthew 28:17</a>. very meagre statement, the whole interest of the evangelist being absorbed by the words spoken by Jesus.—<span class="greekheb">προσεκύνησαν</span> as in <a href="/matthew/28-9.htm" title="And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.

This clause seems to qualify and limit the previous statement as to the worshipping, giving this sense: they worshipped, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the most of them, for some were in doubt. So Meyer, who cites in support Klotz, <span class="ital">Ad Devar</span>, whose statement is to the effect that in passages of this kind containing a clause with <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> without a <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> preceding, a universal affirmation is first made and then a division follows, which shows that a universal affirmation was not really intended (p. 358). Various methods have been adopted to get rid of the unwelcome conclusion that some of the eleven did not do homage, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by taking <span class="greekheb">ἐδίστασαν</span> as a pluperfect (Fritzsche, Grotius), or by finding the doubters among the 500 mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), or even by altering the text <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ</span> into <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> (Beza). The whole narrative is so brief and vague as to lend support to the hypothesis that in the appearance of Jesus here recorded we have not one particular occurrence, but a general picture of the Christophanies, in which mingled conflicting feelings of reverent recognition and hesitation as to the identity of the person played their part. Such is the view of Keil, Steinmeyer, and Holtzmann (H. C.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">worshipped him</span>] See note ch. <a href="/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>.

The day of Pentecost, however, removed all doubt from these, if any remained. The slower they were at first to believe, the greater credit is due to them afterwards as witnesses. Leo, in his first sermon on the Ascension, says, “They doubted, in order that we should not doubt.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They worshipped him.</span> Evidently here they, or the majority of those present (for it is plain that others beside the apostles were there), adored him as God and Lord.

(For the verb, comp. <a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>.) The doubters could not have been any of the eleven, for they had seen the Lord more than once at Jerusalem, and had had indubitable proofs that he had risen from the dead, and was no mere spirit or spiritual appearance, but possessed of his former body, with new powers, faculties, and laws. Those who for the moment doubted did not hesitate to acknowledge his resurrection, but his identity. They were, perhaps, at a distance. Christ may have appeared surrounded with heavenly glory; at any rate, in a shape, or vesture, or with an aspect with which they were not familiar; hence in this majestic form, they failed to recognize the "despised and rejected of men," the lowly Jesus whom they had known (cf. <a href="/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/28.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Worshipped (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>As in <a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>.
