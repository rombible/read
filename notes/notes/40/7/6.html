<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm" title="There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-16.htm" title="Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.">Leviticus 22:16</a>, of which no un clean person or stranger, and <span class= "ital">à fortiori</span> no unclean beast, was to eat. To give that holy flesh to dogs would have seemed to the devout Israelite the greatest of all profanations. Our Lord teaches us that there is a like risk of desecration in dealing with the yet holier treasure of divine truth. Another aspect of the same warning is brought out in the second clause. The fashion of the time had made pearls the costliest of all jewels, as in the parable of <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:">Matthew 13:45</a> (comp. also <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9</a>), and so they too became symbols of the preciousness of truth. The “dogs” and the “swine,” in their turn, represent distinct forms of evil, the former being here, as in <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>, the type of impurity, the latter (as in <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>) of ferocity. The second comparison may possibly imply, as in a condensed fable, the disappointment and consequent rage of the swine at finding that what they took for grain was only pearls. We are to beware lest we so present the truth, either in direct teaching or by an undiscerning disclosure of the deeper religious emotions of the soul, to men, that we make them worse and not better than before.<p>We are met by the questions, Are we, then, to class our fellow-men under these heads, and to think of them as dogs and swine? Is not this to forget the previous teaching, and to judge with the harshest judgment? The answer to these questions must be found, we may believe, in thinking of the dogs and swine as representing not men and women as such, but the passions of this kind or that which make them brutish. So long as they identify themselves with those passions, we must deal cautiously and wisely with them. St. Paul did not preach the gospel to the howling mob at Ephesus, or to the “lewd fellows of the baser sort” at Thessalonica, and yet at another time he would have told any member of those crowds that he too had been redeemed, and might claim an inheritance among those who had been sanctified. We need, it might be added, to be on our guard against the brute element in ourselves not less than in others. There, too, we may desecrate the holiest truths by dealing with them in the spirit of irreverence, or passion, or may cynically jest with our own truest and noblest impulses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Give not, </span>&c. — Even when the beam is cast out of thine own eye. <span class="ital">Give not that which is holy unto dogs </span>— That is, talk not of the <span class="ital">deep</span> <span class="ital">things of God </span>to those whom <span class="ital">you know </span>to be wallowing in sin; neither declare the <span class="ital">great things </span>God hath done for your soul, to the profane, furious, persecuting wretches. Talk not of high degrees of holiness, for instance, to the former; nor of your own experience to the latter. But our Lord does in no wise forbid us to reprove, as occasion is, both the one and the other. There is a transposition in the latter clauses of this verse, where, of the two things proposed, the latter is first treated of. The sense is, <span class="ital">Give not — to dogs </span>— lest, <span class="ital">turning, they rend you. Cast not — to swine, lest they trample them under their feet.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give not that which is holy ... - By some the word "holy" has been supposed to mean "flesh offered in sacrifice," made holy, or separated to a sacred use; but it probably means here "anything connected with religion" - admonition, precept, or doctrine. Pearls are precious stones found in shell-fish, chiefly in India, in the waters that surround Ceylon. They are used to denote anything especially precious, <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45</a>. In this place they are used to denote the doctrines of the gospel. "Dogs" signify people who spurn, oppose, and abuse that doctrine; people of special sourness and malignity of temper, who meet it like growling and quarrelsome curs, <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>. "Swine" denote those who would trample the precepts underfoot; people of impurity of life; those who are corrupt, polluted, profane, obscene, and sensual; those who would not know the value of the gospel, and who would tread it down as swine would pearls, <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-22.htm">Proverbs 11:22</a>. The meaning of this proverb, then, is, do not offer your doctrine to those violent and abusive people who would growl and curse you; nor to those especially debased and profligate who would not perceive its value, would trample it down, and would abuse you. This verse furnishes a beautiful instance of what has been called the "introverted parallelism." The usual mode of poetry among the Hebrews, and a common mode of expression in proverbs and apothegms, was by the parallelism, where one member of a sentence answered to another, or expressed substantially the same sense with some addition or modification. See the Introduction to the Book of Job. Sometimes this was alternate, and sometimes it was introverted - where the first and fourth lines would correspond, and the second and third. This is the case here. The dogs would tear, and not the swine; the swine would trample the pearls under their feet, and not the dogs. It may be thus expressed:<p>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,<p>Neither cast ye your pearls before swine,<p>Lest they (that is, the swine) trample them under their feet,<p>And turn again (that is, the dogs) and rend you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs&#8212;savage or snarling haters of truth and righteousness.<p>neither cast ye your pearls before swine&#8212;the impure or coarse, who are incapable of appreciating the priceless jewels of Christianity. In the East, dogs are wilder and more gregarious, and, feeding on carrion and garbage, are coarser and fiercer than the same animals in the West. Dogs and swine, besides being ceremonially unclean, were peculiarly repulsive to the Jews, and indeed to the ancients generally.<p>lest they trample them under their feet&#8212;as swine do.<p>and turn again and rend you&#8212;as dogs do. Religion is brought into contempt, and its professors insulted, when it is forced upon those who cannot value it and will not have it. But while the indiscriminately zealous have need of this caution, let us be on our guard against too readily setting our neighbors down as dogs and swine, and excusing ourselves from endeavoring to do them good on this poor plea.<p>Prayer (Mt 7:7-11). Enough, one might think, had been said on this subject in Mt 6:5-15. But the difficulty of the foregoing duties seems to have recalled the subject, and this gives it quite a new turn. "How shall we ever be able to carry out such precepts as these, of tender, holy, yet discriminating love?" might the humble disciple inquire. "Go to God with it," is our Lord's reply; but He expresses this with a fulness which leaves nothing to be desired, urging now not only confidence, but importunity in prayer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="ital">swine</span> and <span class="ital">dogs, </span> our Saviour doubtless understandeth wicked men of several sorts, either such as are more tame sinners, trampling upon holy things, and with swine wallowing in the mire of lusts and corruptions, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm" title="As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.">Proverbs 26:11</a> <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a></span>; or, by <span class="ital">dogs, </span> more malicious, revengeful, boisterous sinners may be meant, whose consciences will serve them to bark and grin at the word of God, to mock at holy things, to persecute those that bring them the gospel, and are their open enemies, because they tell them the truth.

The precept doubtless is general, directing the ministers of Christ to administer the holy things, with which they are intrusted, only to such as have a right to them, and under prudent circumstances, so as the holy name of God may not be profaned, nor they run into needless danger. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Give not that which is holy to the dogs,.... Dogs were unclean creatures by the law; the price of one might not be brought into the house of the Lord, for a vow, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a> yea, these creatures were not admitted into several temples of the Heathens (h). Things profane and unclean, as flesh torn by beasts, were ordered to be given to them, <a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> but nothing that was holy was to be given them, as holy flesh, or the holy oblations, or anything that was consecrated to holy uses; to which is the allusion here. It is a common maxim (i) with the Jews, <p>    , "that they do not redeem holy things, to give to the dogs to eat".'' <p>Here the phrase is used in a metaphorical sense; and is generally understood of not delivering or communicating the holy word of God, and the truths of the Gospel, comparable to pearls, or the ordinances of it, to persons notoriously vile and sinful: to men, who being violent and furious persecutors, and impudent blasphemers, are compared to "dogs"; or to such, who are scandalously vile, impure in their lives and conversations, and are therefore compared to swine; <p>neither cast ye your pearls before swine. But since the subject Christ is upon is reproof, it seems rather to be the design of these expressions, that men should be cautious, and prudent, in rebuking and admonishing such persons for their sins, in whom there is no appearance or hope of success; yea, where there is danger of sustaining loss; <p>lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you: that is, despise the admonitions and reproofs given, and hurt the persons who give them, either by words or deeds; see <a href="/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>. The Jews have some sayings much like these, and will serve to illustrate them (k); <p>   , "do not cast pearls before swine", nor deliver wisdom to him, who knows not the excellency of it; for wisdom is better than pearls, and he that does not seek after it, is worse than a swine.'' <p>(h) Vid.

The endeavour to correct the faults of others must be confined within its proper limits, and not allowed to become a casting of holy things to the dogs. As is usual, however, in the case of apophthegms, this progress in the thought is not expressed by a particle (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>). To abandon the idea of connection (Maldonatus, de Wette, Tholuck), or to suppose (Kuinoel, Neander, Bleek; Weiss doubtful) that <a href="/context/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you....">Matthew 7:6-11</a>, at least <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>, do not belong to this passage, is scarcely warranted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ ἅγιον</span>] <span class="ital">the holy</span>, not the holy <span class="ital">flesh</span>, <span class="greekheb">בְּשַׂר קֹדֶשׁ</span>, <a href="/jeremiah/11-15.htm" title="What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.">Jeremiah 11:15</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm" title="If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.">Haggai 2:12</a>, the flesh of sacrifices (v. d. Hardt, Paulus, Tholuck), which, besides, would require to be more precisely designated, otherwise there would be just as much reason to suppose that the holy bread, <span class="greekheb">לחם קדש</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1 Samuel 21:5</a>), or any other meat-offering (<a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow to me: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 22:2</a>), was meant. Christ has in view the holy in general, figuratively designating in the first clause only the persons, and then, in the second, the holy thing. What is meant by this, as also by <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μαργαρίτας</span> immediately after, is the holy, because divine evangelic, truth by which men are converted, and which, by <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μαργαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, is described as something of the highest value, as the precious jewel which is entrusted to the disciples as its possessors. For Arabian applications of this simile, comp. Gesenius in Rosenm. Rep. I. p. 128.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dogs and swine, these impure and thoroughly despised animals, represent those men who are hardened and altogether incapable of receiving evangelic truth, and to whom the holy is utterly foreign and distasteful. The parallelism ought to have precluded the explanation that by both animals two different classes of men are intended (the snappish, as in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>; the filthy livers, Grotius).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήποτε καταπ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">καὶ στραφέντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] applies to the swine, who are to be conceived of as wild animals, as may be seen from <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span> and the whole similitude, so that, as the warning proceeds, the figure of the dogs passes out of view, though, as matter of course, it admits of a corresponding application (Pricaeus, Maldonatus, Tholuck). But this is no reason why the words should be referred to both classes of animals, nor why the trampling should be assigned to the swine and <span class="greekheb">στράφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ῥήξ</span>. to the dogs (Theophylact, Hammond, Calovius, Wolf, Kuinoel).

Zigabenus), or to savagery (Loesner), but manifestly, having turned round upon you from the pearls, which they have mistaken for food, and which, in their rage, they have trampled under their feet; the meaning of which is, lest such men profane divine truth (by blasphemy, mockery, calumny), and vent upon you their malicious feeling toward the gospel. In how many ways must the apostles have experienced this in their own case; for, their preaching being addressed to all, they would naturally, as a rule, have to see its effect on those who heard it before they could know who were “dogs and swine,” so as then to entice them no further with the offer of what is holy, but to shake off the dust, and so on. But the men here in view were to be found among Jews and Gentiles. It is foreign to the present passage (not so <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.">Matthew 15:26</a>) to suppose that only the Gentiles as such are referred to (Köstlin, Hilgenfeld).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>. <span class="ital">A complementary counsel</span>. No connecting word introduces this sentence.

It is a collection of ethical pearls strung loosely together. Yet it is not difficult to suggest a connecting link, thus: I have said, “Judge not,” yet you must know people, else you will make great mistakes, such as, etc. Moral criticism is inevitable. Jesus Himself practised it. He judged the Pharisees, but in the interest of humanity, guided by the law of love. He judged the proud, pretentious, and cruel, in behalf of the weak and despised. All depends on what we judge and why. The Pharisaic motive was egotism; the right motive is defence of the downtrodden or, in certain cases, <span class="ital">self</span>-defence. So <span class="ital">here</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καταπατήσουσι</span>: future well attested, <span class="ital">vide</span> critical note, with subjunctive, <span class="greekheb">ῥήξωσι</span>, in last clause; unusual combination, but not impossible. On the use of the future after <span class="greekheb">μήποτε</span> and other final particles, <span class="ital">vide</span> Burton, <span class="ital">Syntax of the Moods and Tenses in N. T. Greek</span>, § 199.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἅγιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μαργαρίτας</span>: what is the holy thing, and what are the pearls? In a moral aphorism special indications are not to be expected, and we are left to our own conjectures. The “holy” and the “pearls” must define themselves for each individual in his own experience. They are the things which are sacred and precious for a man or woman, and which natural feeling teaches us to be careful not to waste or expose to desecration. For this purpose knowledge of the world, discrimination, is necessary. We must not treat all people alike, and show our valuables, religious experiences, best thoughts, tenderest sentiments, to the first comer. Shyness, reserve, goes along with sincerity, depth, refinement. In all shyness there is implicit judgment of the legitimate kind. A modest woman shrinks from a man whom her instinct discerns to be impure; a child from all hard-natured people. Who blames woman or child? It is but the instinct of self-preservation.—<span class="greekheb">κυσίν</span>, <span class="greekheb">χοίρων</span>. The people to be feared and shunned are those represented by dogs and swine, regarded by Jews as shameless and unclean animals. There are such people, unhappily, even in the judgment of charity, and the shrewd know them and fight shy of them; for no good can come of comradeship with them. Discussions as to whether the dogs and the swine represent two classes of men, or only one, are pedantic. If not the same they are at least similar; one in this, that they are to be avoided. And it is gratuitous to limit the scope of the gnome to the apostles and their work in preaching the gospel. It applies to all citizens of the kingdom, to all who have a treasure to guard, a holy of holies to protect from profane intrusion.—<span class="greekheb">μήποτε</span>, lest perchance. What is to be feared?—<span class="greekheb">καταπατήσουσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ῥήξωσιν</span>: treading under foot (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>., <span class="ital">instrumental</span>, with, de Wette; <span class="ital">among</span>, Weiss) your pearls (<span class="greekheb">αὐτους</span>), rending yourselves. Here again there is trouble for the commentators as to the distribution of the trampling and rending between dogs and swine. Do both do both, or the swine both, or the swine the trampling and the dogs the rending? The latter is the view of Theophylact, and it has been followed by some moderns, including Achelis. On this view the structure of the sentence presents an example of <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνοδος</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὑστέρησις</span>, the first verb referring to the second subject and the second verb to the first subject. The dogs—street dogs, without master, living on offal—rend, because what you have thrown to them, perhaps to propitiate them, being of uncertain temper at the best, is not to their liking; the swine trample under foot what looked like peas or acorns, but turns out to be uneatable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Before passing from these verses (<a href="/context/matthew/7-1.htm" title="Judge not, that you be not judged....">Matthew 7:1-6</a>) two curious opinions may be noted. (1) That <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span> represents an Aramaic word meaning ear-ornaments, answering to pearls. This view, once favoured by Michaelis, Bolten, Kuinoel, etc., and thereafter discredited, has been revived by Holtzmann (H. C.). (2) That <span class="greekheb">ὀφθαλμός</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-3.htm" title="And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but consider not the beam that is in your own eye?">Matthew 7:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-5.htm" title="You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's eye.">Matthew 7:5</a>) means, not the eye, but a village <span class="ital">well</span>. So Furrer. Strange, he says, that a man should need to be told by a neighbour that he has a mote in his eye, or that it should be a fault to propose to take it out! And what sense in the idea of a beam in the eye? But translate the Aramaic word used by Jesus, <span class="ital">well</span>, and all is clear and natural. A neighbour given to fault-finding sees a small impurity in a villager’s well and tauntingly offers to remove it. Meantime his own boys, in his absence, throw a <span class="ital">beam</span> into his own well (<span class="ital">Zeitsch. für M. und R. vide also Wanderungen</span>, p. 222).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The Father’s love for the children of the Kingdom shewn by answering prayer, 7–11.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. The connection between this verse and the preceding section is not quite obvious. It seems to be this. Although evil and censorious judgment is to be avoided, discrimination is needful. The Christian must be judicious, not judicial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that which is holy</span>] i. e. “spiritual truths.” Some have seen in the expression a reference to the holy flesh of the offering (<a href="/haggai/2-12.htm" title="If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.">Haggai 2:12</a>). But this allusion is very doubtful; see Meyer on this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dogs … swine</span>] Unclean animals; see the proverb quoted <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a>; cp. <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a>, “Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers;” also Hor. <span class="ital">Ep.</span> i. 2. 25, “vel canis immundus vel amica luto sus.” See note on ch. <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.">Matthew 15:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pearls</span>] The only gems mentioned in the Gospels, twice named by Jesus: here, where they signify the deepest spiritual thoughts of God and heaven, and ch. <a href="/matthew/13-46.htm" title="Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.">Matthew 13:46</a>, where “the pearl of great price” is the kingdom of heaven itself. The general sense is “use discrimination, discern between holy and unholy, between those who are receptive of these high truths and those who are not.” The profane will despise the gift and put the giver to shame. Want of common sense does great harm to religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μὴ δῶτε</span>, <span class="ital">give not</span>) Here we meet with the other extreme; for the two extremes are, to judge those who ought not to be judged, and to give holy things to the dogs. Too much severity and too much laxity.[303]—<span class="greekheb">κυσὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">χοίρων</span>, <span class="ital">dogs, swine</span>) Dogs feed on their own filth, swine on that of others.

You must not treat those who are mere dogs and swine as if they were able to appreciate either the holiness or the beauty and wealth of spiritual truth. <span class="accented">Give</span> Observe that "give," "cast," are naturally used of feeding dogs and swine respectively. <span class="accented">That which is holy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The metaphor is taken from the law that the things offered in sacrifice were no longer to be treated as common food (<a href="/leviticus/22-1.htm">Leviticus 22:1-16</a>, especially ver. 14, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the dogs</span>.

In form not so very unlike swine's food of beans or nuts, they here represent the beauty and precious wealth of the various parts of the Gospel, in which Christ's disciples are accustomed to delight (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Ignatius ('Ephesians,' &sect; 11) calls his bonds his "spiritual pearls." <span class="cmt_word">Before swine</span>; <span class="accented">before the swine</span> (Revised Version). Probably in both cases the article is used with the object of bringing the particular dogs and swine to whom these are given more vividly before us. <span class="accented">Swine.</span> Which have no care for such things, but rather wallow in filth (<a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>). <span class="accented">Dogs... swine.</span> The terms seem to so far indicate different classes of men, or more truly different characters in men, as that the one term points to the greedy participation of the wicked in open profanation, the ether to the sottish indifference of sinners to that which is most attractive. <span class="cmt_word">Lest</span> <span class="cmt_word">they;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the swine. Dogs, even though wild in the East, would not "tread down" the food. <span class="cmt_word">Trample them under their feet</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>). In ignorance of their real worth and in disappointment that they do not afford them satisfaction (For the future, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>, note.) It here expresses the greater certainty of the trampling than of the rending (aorist subjective). <span class="cmt_word">And turn again</span> - Revised Version omits "again" <span class="cmt_word">- and rend you</span>. In rage at the disappointment experienced. The clause expresses the personal enmity which those who wilfully reject the gospel often feel towards those that have offered it to them. It might be thought difficult to carry out this command, as it is evident that we cannot know beforehand who will accept the gospel or not. But in cases where the character of the person is not known (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> as when St. Paul preached at Athens, etc.), the command does not apply. Our Lord <span class="accented">supposes</span> the case where the character is apparent (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a>). Theodoret (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 103, 168), in quoting this verse, adds, "My mysteries are tot me and mine," which, clearly an adaptation of Symmachus and Theodotion's rendering of <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. also Targ.
