It is not easy to trace the currents of thought that run through a corrupt casuistry, but probably the line of reasoning that led to this distinction was that the “gold of the Temple”—not the gold used in its structural ornamentation, but that which in coin or bullion was part of the Corban, or sacred treasure (<a href="/matthew/15-5.htm" title="But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me;">Matthew 15:5</a>)—had received a more special consecration than the fabric, and involved, therefore, a higher obligation, when used as a <span class= "ital">formula jurandi,</span> than the Temple or the altar. Something of the same feeling is seen in the popular casuistry which makes the binding force of an oath depend on “kissing the Book;” or that of mediæval Christendom, which saw in the relics of a saint that which was more sacred than the Gospels. The principle involved in our Lord’s teaching goes further than its immediate application, and sweeps away the arbitrary distinction of different degrees of sanctity in the several parts of the same structure. Here the line of reasoning is, as in <a href="/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, that the Temple includes the altar, that the altar includes the gift, that the heaven includes the Throne, and that thus every oath-formula runs up, explicitly or implicitly, into the great thought of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!...">Matthew 23:16-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wo unto you, ye blind guides — </span>Before he had styled them <span class="ital">hypocrites, </span>from their personal character; now he gives them another title respecting their false doctrine and influence upon others.

Here we have the fourth reason of the woes denounced. <span class="ital">Which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing</span> — It constitutes no obligation to tell the truth or to perform one’s oath. <span class="ital">But whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple </span>— That is, by the treasure kept there, <span class="ital">he is a debtor </span>— Gr. <span class="greekheb">οφειλει</span>, <span class="ital">he oweth, </span>that is, is obliged to perform his oath. “It seems,” says Dr. Doddridge, “the Pharisees taught, that oaths by the creatures might be used on trifling occasions, and violated without any great guilt. But they excepted oaths by the corban,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(the gift,) and by sacrifices; in which it is plain that, without any regard to common sense or decency, they were influenced merely by a view to their own interest; and therefore represented these to the people as things of more eminent sanctity than even the temple or altar itself.” <span class="ital">Whoso shall swear by the altar, sweareth by all things thereon </span>— Not only by the altar, but by the holy fire and the sacrifices, and above all by that God to whom they belonged; inasmuch as every oath by a creature, if it has any meaning, is an implicit appeal to the Creator himself. <span class="ital">Whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by him that dwelleth therein — </span>Consequently, the oath is a solemn wishing that he, who dwells in the temple, may hinder him from ever worshipping there, if he be telling a falsehood or neglect his vow. <span class="ital">He that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, </span>&c. — And therefore his oath is a solemn wishing that God, who dwells in heaven, may exclude him out of that blessed place for ever, if he falsify his oath. For a further explanation of the subject of oaths, see the note on <a href="/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:...">Matthew 5:33-37</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:13-33 The scribes and Pharisees were enemies to the gospel of Christ, and therefore to the salvation of the souls of men. It is bad to keep away from Christ ourselves, but worse also to keep others from him. Yet it is no new thing for the show and form of godliness to be made a cloak to the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety will be reckoned double iniquity. They were very busy to turn souls to be of their party. Not for the glory of God and the good of souls, but that they might have the credit and advantage of making converts. Gain being their godliness, by a thousand devices they made religion give way to their worldly interests. They were very strict and precise in smaller matters of the law, but careless and loose in weightier matters. It is not the scrupling a little sin that Christ here reproves; if it be a sin, though but a gnat, it must be strained out; but the doing that, and then swallowing a camel, or, committing a greater sin. While they would seem to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. We are really, what we are inwardly. Outward motives may keep the outside clean, while the inside is filthy; but if the heart and spirit be made new, there will be newness of life; here we must begin with ourselves. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornaments of a grave, or dressing up a dead body, only for show. The deceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears in that they go down the streams of the sins of their own day, while they fancy that they should have opposed the sins of former days. We sometimes think, if we had lived when Christ was upon earth, that we should not have despised and rejected him, as men then did; yet Christ in his Spirit, in his word, in his ministers, is still no better treated. And it is just with God to give those up to their hearts' lusts, who obstinately persist in gratifying them. Christ gives men their true characters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whosoever shall swear ... - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>.<p>The temple - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>.<p>It is nothing - It amounts to nothing - it is not binding.<p>The gold of the temple - Either the golden vessels in the temple - the candlestick, etc.; or the gold with which the doors and other parts of the temple were covered; or the gold in the treasury.

Meaning the same persons, the Scribes and Pharisees, as before, though not named, who pretended to be "guides of the blind", <a href="/romans/2-19.htm">Romans 2:19</a> but were them selves blind, and so very unfit to be guides of others; they were as they were born, ignorant of divine things, of God in Christ, of the true Messiah, of the true meaning of the Scriptures, of the spirituality of the law, and of the Gospel of Christ; and the way of salvation by him; and their minds were blinded by the God of this world, and with a greedy, and insatiable covetousness after the things of it, of which Christ here gives an instance: <p>which say, whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; meaning either that it was no sin to use such an oath, or it was not binding upon a man: he might choose whether he would abide by what he swore by the temple he would do; and thus they ignorantly, and wickedly encouraged vain swearing and perjury. It was usual with them to swear by the temple: take an instance or two. <p>"Says R. Jochanan (p),  "by the temple", it is in our hands; but what shall I do?'' <p>The gloss upon it is; <p>"it is an oath by the temple of God, that it is in our power to reveal the illegitimacy of the families of the land of Israel.'' <p>"Says R. Zechariah ben Hakatzab (q), , "by this habitation" (meaning the temple), her hand was not removed from my hand from the time the Gentiles entered into Jerusalem, to the time they went out.'' <p>Jarchi and Bartenora's note on it is, this is an oath. Again, <p>"says R. Simeon ben Gamaliel (r), , "by this habitation"; I will not rest this night until they (doves) are sold for pence apiece.'' <p>The gloss on it is, "he swore by the sanctuary." <p>But whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is guilty; or is bound, or is a debtor, to make good his oath; he cannot be excused, but must be obliged to fulfil it; or if he does not, he is guilty of perjury. This is to be understood not of the gold that covered any part of the temple; nor of the golden vessels in it; but of the gold, or money, or gifts which were offered for the service of the temple: and the sense is, that whosoever swore by "Korban", and that this, or that should be as "Korban", he should not go back from it; he was obliged to give it. This showed the covetous disposition of these men, who made nothing of oaths that were swore by the temple; but those that were made by the "Korban", or the gifts of it, were binding, because their interest was in it; it was for their gain. <p>(p) T.
