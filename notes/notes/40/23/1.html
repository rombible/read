The name <span class="ital">Pharisees </span>being the appellation of a sect, it cannot be supposed that our Lord meant to say of all the party that they sat in Moses’s chair. Such a character was applicable to none but the doctors of the sect; for which reason we must suppose that the name <span class="ital">scribes </span>and <span class="ital">Pharisees </span>is a Hebraism for the <span class="ital">Pharisean scribes.

As we must not receive corrupt doctrines for the sake of any laudable practices of those that teach them; so we must not imitate bad examples for the sake of the plausible doctrines of those that give them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-12 The scribes and Pharisees explained the law of Moses, and enforced obedience to it. They are charged with hypocrisy in religion. We can only judge according to outward appearance; but God searches the heart. They made phylacteries. These were scrolls of paper or parchment, wherein were written four paragraphs of the law, to be worn on their foreheads and left arms, Ex 13:2-10; 13:11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They made these phylacteries broad, that they might be thought more zealous for the law than others. God appointed the Jews to make fringes upon their garments, Nu 15:38, to remind them of their being a peculiar people; but the Pharisees made them larger than common, as if they were thereby more religious than others. Pride was the darling, reigning sin of the Pharisees, the sin that most easily beset them, and which our Lord Jesus takes all occasions to speak against. For him that is taught in the word to give respect to him that teaches, is commendable; but for him that teaches, to demand it, to be puffed up with it, is sinful. How much is all this against the spirit of Christianity! The consistent disciple of Christ is pained by being put into chief places. But who that looks around on the visible church, would think this was the spirit required? It is plain that some measure of this antichristian spirit prevails in every religious society, and in every one of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If David ... - If he was then David's lord if he was his superior - if he had an existence at that time how could he be descended from him? They could not answer him.<p>Nor is there any way of answering the question but by the admission that the Messiah was divine as well as human; that he had an existence at the time of David, and was his lord and master, his God I and king, and that as man he was descended from him.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a><p>1. Multitudes of people, who are invited to be saved, reject the gospel and perish in their sins, <a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a>.<p>2. If they perish, they only will be to blame. The offer was freely made, the salvation was provided, and the only reason why they were not saved was that they would not come, <a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a>.<p>3. Attention to the affairs of this life, the love of the world, will shut many out of the kingdom of heaven, <a href="/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a>. Some attention to those things is necessary; but such a devotion to these things as to lead to the loss of the soul never can be right.<p>4. It is treating God ungratefully to reject his gospel, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3-5</a>. He has sent his Son to die for us; he has entreated us to be saved; he has followed us with mercies; and to reject all these, and refuse to be saved, is to treat him with contempt, as well as to overwhelm ourselves in condemnation. "Man has no right to be damned." He is under the most solemn obligations to be "saved;" and after what God has done for us, deep and dreadful woe will await us if we are so foolish and wicked as to be lost.<p>5. Many of the poor and needy will be saved, while the haughty and rich will perish forever, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9-10</a>.<p>6. Let those who make a profession of religion look often to the great day when Christ will search them, <a href="/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11</a>. There is a day coming that will try us. His eye will be upon us. He will read our hearts, and see whether we are clothed in his righteousness, or only the filthy rags of our own.<p>7. A profession of religion will not save us, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11-13</a>. It is foolish to deceive ourselves. Nothing but genuine piety, true faith in Jesus, and a holy life, will save us. God asks not profession merely, but the heart. He asks not mockery, but sincerity; not pretension, but reality.<p>8. The hypocrite must perish, <a href="/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>. It is right that he should perish. He knew his Master's will and would not do it. He must perish with an awful condemnation. No man sins amid so much light, none with so high a hand. No sin is so awful as to attempt to deceive God, and to palm pretensions on him for reality.<p>9. Pretended friends are sometimes more dangerous than avowed enemies, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. Pretended friendship is often for the purpose of decoying us into evil. It throws us off our guard, and we are more easily taken.<p>10. The truth is often admitted by wicked people from mere hypocrisy, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. It is only for the purpose of deceiving others and leading them into sin.<p>11. Wicked people can decide correctly on the character of a public preacher, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. They often admit his claim in words, but for an evil purpose.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 23<p>Mt 23:1-39.

After the Pharisees have been thus <span class="ital">silenced</span>, there now follows the decisive and direct <span class="ital">attack</span> upon the hierarchs, in a series of overwhelming denunciations extending to <a href="/matthew/23-39.htm" title="For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Matthew 23:39</a>, and which, uttered as they are on the eve of His death, form a kind of Messianic <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> through which Jesus seeks to testify against them. Luke has inserted at ch. 11 portions of this discourse in an order different from the original; but he has given in the present connection, like Mark 12, only a few fragments, so that, keeping in view that a collection of our Lord’s sayings was made by Matthew, and considering the originality in respect of matter and arrangement which characterizes the grand utterances now before us, the preference must be accorded to the report furnished by this apostle (in answer to Schleiermacher, Schulz, Schneckenburger, Olshausen, Volkmar). The entire discourse has so much the character of a living whole, that, although much that was spoken on other occasions may perhaps be mixed up with it, it is scarcely possible to disjoin such passages from those that are essentially original. Ewald thinks that the discourse is made up of passages that were probably original, though uttered on very different occasions; Holtzmann has recourse to the hypothesis that the evangelist has derived his account from a supposed special source, the same as that on which ch. 5 is based; in answer to the latter, see Weiss, 1864, p. 114. Observe that the <span class="greekheb">ὄχλοι</span> are mentioned first, because the first part of the discourse on to <a href="/matthew/23-7.htm" title="And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.">Matthew 23:7</a> is directed to them, then the <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> are addressed in <a href="/context/matthew/23-8.htm" title="But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers....">Matthew 23:8-12</a>, whereupon in <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm" title="But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.">Matthew 23:13</a> ff. we have the withering apostrophe to the Pharisees who were present, and that for the purpose of warning the <span class="greekheb">ὄχλοι</span> and the <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> to beware of them; and finally, the concluding passage, <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a> ff., containing the pathetic exclamation over Jerusalem. The glance, the gesture, the attitude, the matter and the language, were such that there could be no doubt who were immediately aimed at in the various sections of the discourse. We may imagine the scene in the temple to have been as follows: in the <span class="ital">foreground</span>, Jesus with His <span class="ital">disciples</span>; a little <span class="ital">farther off</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ὄχλοι</span>; more <span class="ital">in the background</span>, the Pharisees, who in <a href="/matthew/22-46.htm" title="And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.">Matthew 22:46</a> are spoken of as having withdrawn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/23-1.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,...">Matthew 23:1-12</a>. <span class="ital">Introduction to the discourse</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/23-1.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,">Matthew 23:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τότε</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>) Having left His adversaries to themselves.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-39.</span> - <span class="accented">Denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, and lamentation over Jerusalem which followed their guidance to her own destruction.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then spake Jesus</span>.

It is here addressed to the multitude, and to his disciples, and seems to have been designed to comfort the former under the difficulty of having accredited teachers who were proved to have misunderstood Scripture, and were incapable of interpreting it aright. He willed to show how far they were to follow these instructors, and where it was necessary to draw a line beyond which they were not to be obeyed. Some modern critics have suggested that this discourse was not spoken at this time, but that St. Matthew has here collected into one body certain sayings of our Lord uttered at different times and places. It is far more natural to suppose that St. Matthew's statement of the occasion of this discourse is historically true, and that Christ here repeated some parts of the censure he had already, in the course of his ministry, found it necessary to pronounce. The unity of this utterance in form and essence, its logical sequence and climactic character, prove that it was delivered at one time, and was intended to form the Lord's farewell address to the wayward people who would not come unto him that they might have life. The discourse may be divided into three parts. </body></html>
