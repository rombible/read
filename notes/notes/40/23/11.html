The latter interpretation seems to give on the whole the best meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/23-11.htm" title="But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant....">Matthew 23:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">But he that is greatest among you, </span>&c. — If any one among you would in reality be greater than another, let him be the more condescending, kind, and ready cheerfully to serve others in love. The words may either imply, 1st, a promise that such should be accounted greatest, and stand highest in the favour of God, who should be most humble, submissive, and serviceable: or, 2d, a precept enjoining the person who should be advanced to any place of dignity, trust, or honour in the church, to consider himself as peculiarly called thereby, not to be a lord, but a minister, and to serve others in love.

They are charged with hypocrisy in religion. We can only judge according to outward appearance; but God searches the heart. They made phylacteries. These were scrolls of paper or parchment, wherein were written four paragraphs of the law, to be worn on their foreheads and left arms, Ex 13:2-10; 13:11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They made these phylacteries broad, that they might be thought more zealous for the law than others. God appointed the Jews to make fringes upon their garments, Nu 15:38, to remind them of their being a peculiar people; but the Pharisees made them larger than common, as if they were thereby more religious than others. Pride was the darling, reigning sin of the Pharisees, the sin that most easily beset them, and which our Lord Jesus takes all occasions to speak against. For him that is taught in the word to give respect to him that teaches, is commendable; but for him that teaches, to demand it, to be puffed up with it, is sinful. How much is all this against the spirit of Christianity! The consistent disciple of Christ is pained by being put into chief places. But who that looks around on the visible church, would think this was the spirit required? It is plain that some measure of this antichristian spirit prevails in every religious society, and in every one of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a>.<p>He that shall humble himself ... - God will exalt or honor him that is humble, and that seeks a lowly place among people.

Either who really is so, having more grace, and greater gifts bestowed upon him, than others; which doubtless was the case of some of the disciples, or who desired to be the greatest, was ambitious of, and affected a superiority over others, and to be in the highest post and place, as it is certain some of them did. This was what they were often contending about among themselves, who should be greatest: and Christ here seems to have regard to that vain spirit, which appeared among them; and his view is, to check and restrain it: "shall be your servant"; or "let him be your servant". Service is the way to honour; he that would be most esteemed ought to do the most work; and the man that has the most grace, and the greatest gifts, ought to employ them for the use and benefit of others; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/23-11.htm" title="But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant....">Matthew 23:11-12</a>, epeat in substance the teaching of <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm" title="But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;">Matthew 20:26</a> : <a href="/matthew/18-4.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 18:4</a>; worth repeating and by no means out of place here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.
