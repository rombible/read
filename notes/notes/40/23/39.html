A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners and eternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall not see me ... - The day of your mercy is gone by.

Does Jesus mean that He was Himself the Lord of the temple, and that it became "deserted" when He finally left it? It is even so. Now is thy fate sealed, O Jerusalem, for the glory is departed from thee! That glory, once visible in the holy of holies, over the mercy seat, when on the day of atonement the blood of typical expiation was sprinkled on it and in front of it&#8212;called by the Jews the Shekinah, or the Dwelling, as being the visible pavilion of Jehovah&#8212;that glory, which Isaiah (Isa 6:1-13) saw in vision, the beloved disciple says was the glory of Christ (Joh 12:41). Though it was never visible in the second temple, Haggai foretold that "the glory of that latter house should be greater than of the former" (Hag 2:9) because "the Lord whom they sought was suddenly to come to His temple" (Mal 3:1), not in a mere bright cloud, but enshrined in living humanity!

That such a time will come is clear from Zec 12:10; Ro 11:26; 2Co 3:15, 16, &c.

Meaning in a very little time after the passover, from the time of his crucifixion and death; otherwise they saw him many times after this, as in the palace of the high priest, in Pilate's judgment hall, and on the cross; but not after his resurrection. This shows the reason of their house being desolate, and in what sense it should be so, and immediately became so; namely, by being then directly, and ever after, destitute of his presence: and though they might afterwards seek for, and expect the Messiah in it, yet they would never be able to see him, nor throughout their long captivity: till ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; that is, until the time comes, that the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and all Israel shall be saved, the Jews shall be converted, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; when they shall readily and cheerfully say these words to Christ, who will then appear in his glory; which they were now displeased at in the multitude that followed him, and the children in the temple. Though some think this is said by way of threatening, since the rest that is spoken to them by Christ is of that sort, and regards the men of that generation; and is given as a reason of their house being left desolate: and the sense is, that they should never see him with joy and pleasure; since, though they would be obliged to confess that he was Lord and Christ, they would never say the above words to him in faith, and holy reverence of him.

The words of Jesus, and the place, and the anger of the Scribes, may have recalled to some the scene in which Jeremiah, on the same spot, denounced the sin of Israel, called them to repentance, and foretold the destruction of the Temple: “then will I make this house like Shiloh” … “and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die,” <a href="/context/jeremiah/26-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,...">Jeremiah 26:1-8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/23-39.htm" title="For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Matthew 23:39</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λέγω</span>, <span class="ital">I say</span>) See Gnomon on <a href="/luke/13-35.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Luke 13:35</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἴδητε</span>, <span class="ital">ye shall see</span>) sc. you, inhabitants of Jerusalem.

That which is here foretold will actually come to pass at the appointed time, as in ch. <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a> was performed that which had been predicted in <a href="/luke/13-35.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Luke 13:35</a>.

For neither had all joined in this acclamation to Him, nor had they who did so understood what they were saying, as Israel shall understand hereafter: and soon after they, as it were, retracted their acclamation. The first utterance of these words was less complete, the second will be worthy of the name.[1027] Cf. Gnomon on the omission of “<span class="ital">again</span>,” in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm" title="Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.">Acts 1:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εὐλογημένος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">Blessed</span>, etc.) With this verse concludes our Lord’s public discourse to the Jews: with this verse will begin their repentance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1024] E.

In a few days he will be separated from them by death and burial; and, though he appeared to certain chosen witnesses after his resurrection, he was seen no more by the people (<a href="/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>); their house was deserted. Some take the word "see" in the sense of know, recognize; but it seems rather weak to say, "Ye shall not know me till ye acknowledge me as Messiah," as the knowing and acknowledging are practically identical or simultaneous. <span class="cmt_word">Till ye shall say,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!</span> The words which had greeted his triumphal entry a few days before (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>). The clause, "till ye shall say," does not shut the door of hope forever; it looks forward to a happier prospect. The time intended is that when Israel shall repent of its rejection of the Messiah, and in bitter contrition look on him whom it pierced, owning and receiving Jesus with glad "Hosannahs!" Then shall they behold him coming in power and glory, and shall regain their old position as beloved of God (see <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4, 5</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). Then "all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>).
