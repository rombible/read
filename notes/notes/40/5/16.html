If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy.

Here Christ applies the foregoing simile to his disciples, and more fully opens the meaning and design of it. His sense is this; that the light of the Gospel, which he had communicated to them, the spiritual knowledge of the mysteries of grace, which he had favoured them with, were to be openly declared, and made manifest before men. Light was not given merely for their own private use, but for the public good of mankind; and therefore, as they were placed as lights in the world, they were to hold forth, in the most open and conspicuous manner, the word of light and life: <p>that they may see your good works: meaning their zeal and fervency; their plainness and openness; their sincerity, faithfulness, and integrity; their courage and intrepidity; their diligence, industry, and indefatigableness in preaching the Gospel; their strict regard to truth, the honour of Christ, and the good of souls; as also their very great care and concern to recommend the doctrines of grace, by their example in their lives and conversations: <p>and glorify your Father which is in heaven; that is, that when the ministration of the Gospel has been blessed, for the illumination of the minds of men, to a thorough conviction of their state; and for their regeneration, conversion, sanctification, and comfort; they may give praise to God, and bless his name for qualifying and sending such Gospel ministers to show unto them the way of salvation; and that the word has been made useful to them for communicating spiritual light, life, joy, and comfort, , "Our and your Father which is in heaven", is a name, appellation, or periphrasis of God, frequently used by Jewish writers (s); and is often expressed by Christ in these his sermons on the mount. <p>(s) Vid.

This designation of God, which Christ gives forth from the fundamental standpoint of His gospel, already presupposes instructions previously given to the disciples upon the point. Observe, moreover, that here it is not <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> which, as formerly, has the emphasis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὕτω</span>. Do ye as they do in cottage life: apply the parable.—<span class="greekheb">λαμψάτω</span>, let your light shine. Don’t use means to prevent it, turning the rare exception of household practice into the rule, so extinguishing your light, or at least rendering it useless. Cowards can always find plausible excuses for the policy of obscuration—reasons of prudence and wisdom: gradual accustoming of men to new ideas; deference to the prejudices of good men; avoidance of rupture by premature outspokenness; but generally the true reason is fear of unpleasant consequences to oneself. Their conduct Jesus represents as disloyalty to God—<span class="greekheb">ὅπως</span>, etc. The shining of light from the good works of disciples glorifies God the Father in heaven. The hiding of the light means withholding glory. The temptation arises from the fact—a stern law of the moral world it is—that just when most glory is likely to accrue to God, least glory comes to the light-bearer; not glory but dishonour and evil treatment his share. Many are ready enough to let their light shine when honour comes to themselves. But <span class="ital">their</span> “light” is not true heaven-kindled light; their works are not <span class="greekheb">καλὰ</span>, noble, heroic, but <span class="greekheb">πονηρὰ</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm" title="Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.">Matthew 7:17</a>), ignoble, worthless, at best of the conventional type in fashion among religious people, and wrought often in a spirit of vanity and ostentation. This is <span class="ital">theatrical</span> goodness, which is emphatically not what Jesus wanted. Euthy. Zig. says: <span class="greekheb">οὐ κελεύει θεατρίζειν τὴν ἀρετὴν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note that here, for the first time in the Gospel, Christ’s distinctive name for God, “Father,” occurs. It comes in as a thing of course. Does it presuppose previous instruction? (So Meyer.) One might have expected so important a topic as the nature and name of God to have formed the subject of a distinct lesson. But Christ’s method of teaching was not scholastic or formal. He defined terms by <span class="ital">discriminating use</span>; Father, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, as a name for God, by using it as a motive to noble conduct. The motive suggested throws light on the name. God, we learn, as Father delights in noble conduct; as human fathers find joy in sons who acquit themselves bravely. Jesus may have given formal instruction on the point, but not necessarily. This first use of the title is very significant. It is <span class="ital">full</span>, solemn, impressive: your Father, He who is in the heavens; so again in <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>. It is suggestive of reasons for faithfulness, reasons of love and reverence. It hints at a reflected glory, the reward of heroism. The noble works which glorify the Father reveal the workers to be sons. The double-sided doctrine of this <span class="ital">logion</span> of Jesus is that the divine is revealed by the heroic in human conduct, and that the moral hero is the true son of God. Jesus Himself is the highest illustration of the twofold truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Let your light so shine</span> …] The word translated “shine” is rendered “giveth light” in the preceding verse.

Our Lord has here no thought of effort in shining, such as may improve the brightness of the light given, or of illuminating others, but of not concealing what light the disciples have.

The Fatherhood of God is here predicated in a special sense of the disciples, in the same way as the Fatherhood of God is, in the Old Testament, always connected with his covenant relation to his people as a nation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> here is not thinking of the original relation of God to being and especially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the Divine image (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), but of the relation into which the disciples have entered through the revelation of God in Christ; cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a> (Add. Note) and on <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a> (Add. Note); also Weiss, 'Life,' 2:348. The phrase, which occurs here for the first time in St. Matthew (but cf. ver. 9, note), henceforth occurs frequently, becoming of great importance for this Gospel (cf. vers. 45, 48; <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 9</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>So shine (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Often misconceived, as if the meaning were, "Let your light shine in such a way that men may see," etc. Standing at the beginning of the sentence, it points back to the illustration just used. "So," even as that lamp just mentioned, let your light shine. Wycliffe has apparently caught this correct sense: So shine your light before men. </body></html>
