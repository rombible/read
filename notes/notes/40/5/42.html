Were we to give to all men what they ask, we should in many cases be cursing, not blessing, them with our gifts. Not so does our Father give us what we ask in prayer; not so did Christ grant the prayers of His disciples. That which the words really teach as the ideal of the perfect life which we ought to aim at, is the loving and the giving temper that sees in every request made to us the expression of a want of some kind, which we are to consider as a call to thoughtful inquiry how best to meet the want, giving what is asked for if we honestly believe that it is really for the good of him who asks, giving something else if that would seem to be really better for him. Rightly understood, the words do not bid us idly give alms to the idle or the impostor; and St. Paul’s rule, “If a man will not work, neither let him eat” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>), is not a departure from the law of Christ, but its truest application and fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">From him that would borrow.</span>—The force of the precept depends on its connection with the Jewish Law, which forbade not only what we call usury, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> excessive interest, but all interest on loans where debtor and creditor alike were Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-37.htm" title="You shall not give him your money on usury, nor lend him your victuals for increase.">Leviticus 25:37</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>). From our modern point of view that law cannot be regarded as in harmony with the present order of society, nor consistent with our modern views of financial justice. It is not the less true, however, that in the education of a family or nation, such a prohibition may be a necessary and useful discipline. We should look with scorn on boys who lent on interest to their brothers or their schoolfellows, and the ideal of the Law of Moses was that of treating all Israelites as brothers brought under the discipline of the schoolmaster. As if with a prescient insight into the besetting temptation of the race, the lawgiver forbade a practice which would have destroyed, and eventually did destroy, the sense of brotherhood (<a href="/context/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.">Nehemiah 5:1-13</a>), leaving it open to receive interest from strangers who were outside the limits of the family (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm" title="To a stranger you may lend on usury; but to your brother you shall not lend on usury: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land where you go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>). The higher law of Christ treats all men as brothers, and bids us, if it is right to lend as an act of charity, to do so for love, and not for profit. Cases where the business of the world calls for loans not for the relief of want, but as a matter of commercial convenience, lie obviously outside the range of the precept.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:38-42 The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give to him that asketh thee - This is the general rule. It is better to give sometimes to an undeserving person than to turn away one who is really in need. It is good to be in the habit of giving. At the same time, the rule must be interpreted so as to be consistent with our duty to our families <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a> and with other objects of justice and charity. It is seldom, perhaps never, good to give to a person who is able to work, <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>. To give to such is to encourage laziness, and to support the idle at the expense of the industrious. If such a one is indeed hungry, feed him; if he needs anything further, give him employment. If a widow, an orphan, a man of misfortune, or an infirmed man, lame, or sick, is at your door, never send any of them away empty. See <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-45</a>. So this is true of a poor and needy friend that wishes to borrow. We are not to turn away or deny him. This deserves, however, some limitation. It must be done in consistency with other duties. To lend to every worthless man would be to throw away our property, encourage laziness and crime, and ruin our own families. It should be done consistently with every other obligation, and of this everyone is to be the judge. Perhaps our Saviour meant to teach that where there was a deserving friend or brother in need, we should lend to him without usury, and without standing much about the security. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42.

This shows that such counsels as "Owe no man anything" (Ro 13:8), are not to be taken absolutely; else the Scripture commendations of the righteous for "lending" to his necessitous brother (Ps 37:36; 112:5; Lu 6:37) would have no application.<p>turn not thou away&#8212;a graphic expression of unfeeling refusal to relieve a brother in extremity.<p>Same Subject&#8212;Love to Enemies (Mt 5:43-48).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In these words our Saviour presseth another piece of charity, viz. liberality to those who are poor; who are of two sorts: some such as are never able to repay us; to those he commandeth Christians <span class="ital">to give.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To him that asketh, </span> who hath need to ask, and in that order too which God hath directed, who hath commanded us to provide for our own household, and to do good to all, but especially to the household of faith.

Some have doubted the genuineness of the <span class="ital">logion</span> as a part of the Sermon. But it occurs in Luke’s redaction (<a href="/matthew/6-30.htm" title="Why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?">Matthew 6:30</a>), transformed indeed so as to make it a case of the sturdy beggar who helps himself to what he does not get for the asking. Were there idle, lawless tramps in Palestine in our Lord’s time, and would He counsel such treatment of them? If so, it is the extreme instance of not resisting evil.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀποστραφῇς</span> with <span class="greekheb">τὸν θέλοντα</span> in accusative.
