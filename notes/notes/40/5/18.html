And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.">Nehemiah 5:13</a>, it appears in its Hebrew form. From the worship of the synagogue it passed into that of the Christian Church, and by the time the Gospels were written had become so familiar that it was used without hesitation by all the Evangelists, sometimes singly, sometimes (uniformly in St. John) with the emphasis of reduplication.<p><span class= "bld">Till heaven and earth pass.</span>—The formula was probably one in common use by our Lord to express the unchangeableness of the divine word. It was afterwards used, we must remember, by our Lord, with even augmented force, in reference to His own words (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>; <a href="/mark/13-31.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.">Mark 13:31</a>; <a href="/luke/21-33.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.">Luke 21:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">One jot or one tittle.</span>—The “jot” is the Greek <span class= "ital">iota</span> (0, the Hebrew <span class= "ital">yod </span>(’)<span class= "ital">,</span> the smallest of all the letters of the alphabet. The “tittle” was one of the smaller strokes, or twists of other letters, such, e.g., as distinguished <span class= "greekheb">ד</span> (D) from <span class= "greekheb">ר</span> (R), or <span class= "greekheb">כ</span> (K) from <span class= "greekheb">ב</span> (B). Jewish Rabbis used to caution their scholars against so writing as to cause one letter to be mistaken for another, and to give examples of passages from the Law in which such a mistake would turn a divine truth into nonsense or blasphemy. The <span class= "ital">yod</span> in its turn was equally important. It distinguished Joshua from Hoshea, Sarai from Sarah. The Jews had indeed a strange legend that its insertion in the former name was given as a compensation for its exclusion from the latter. The meaning is obvious enough,” Nothing truly belonging to the Law, however seemingly trivial, shall drift away and be forgotten until it has done all that it was meant to do.”<p><span class= "bld">Till all be fulfilled.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">Till all things have come to pass.</span> The words in the English version suggest an identity with the “fulfil” of <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>, which is not found in the Greek. The same formula is used in the Greek of <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>. The “all things” in both cases are the great facts of our Lord’s life, death, resurrection, and the establishment of the kingdom of God. So taken, we find that the words do not assert, as at first they seem to do, the perpetual obligation even of the details of the Law, but the limit up to which the obligation was to last; and they are therefore not inconsistent with the words which speak of the system of the Law as a whole as “decaying and waxing old, and ready to vanish away” (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>). The two “untils” have each of them their significance. Each “jot” or “tittle “must first complete its work; then, and not till then, will it pass away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-18.htm" title="For truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one stroke or one pronunciation mark shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.">Matthew 5:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">For verily I say unto you </span>— This expression, whereby our Lord often prefaces what he is about to say, always imports the great importance, as well as certain truth of it. <span class="ital">Till heaven and earth pass away</span> — Till the whole visible frame of nature be disjointed and dissolved, <span class="ital">one jot or one tittle </span>— “The word <span class="greekheb">ιωτα</span>, which we render <span class="ital">jot, </span>undoubtedly answers to the Hebrew letter <span class="greekheb">י</span>, <span class="ital">jod, </span>whence the English word here seems to be derived, and which, being the least letter of the alphabet, might properly be used proverbially on this occasion. <span class="greekheb">Κεραια</span>, which we render <span class="ital">tittle, </span>properly signifies one of those little ornamental curvatures or flourishes, which, when Hebrew is elegantly written, are generally used at the beginning and end of a letter, and sometimes at the corners too.

And the predictions of the prophets have their proper effect and confirmation, when they are accomplished. Some, however, understand the words as meaning, <span class="ital">till the end, </span>or, <span class="ital">consummation of all things shall come, </span>or, till the heavens and the earth shall pass away, or be destroyed. The meaning of our Lord’s words, according to this interpretation, is, that there is nothing in the universe so stable as the truths contained in the moral law, and nothing so certain as the fulfilment of the predictions of the prophets: the heavens may fall, and the whole frame of nature be unhinged, nay, every part of it may be dissolved; but the rules of righteousness, and the declarations of the divine word, with their sanctions, shall remain immutable and eternal: for <span class="ital">the word of the Lord endureth for ever, </span><a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever.

Our Lord therefore proceeds, in the two next verses, to command his disciples, on the severest penalties, to enforce, both by their doctrine and example, the strict observation of all the moral precepts contained in the sacred writings, and that in their utmost extent.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:17-20 Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with any commands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man, pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same, whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in a man's temper and conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Verily - Truly, certainly. A word of strong affirmation.<p>Till heaven and earth pass - This expression denotes that the law never would be destroyed until it should be all fulfilled. It is the same as saying everything else may change; the very earth and heaven may pass away, but the law of God shall not be destroyed until its whole design has been accomplished.<p>One jot - The word "jot," or yod (&#1497;  y), is the name of the Hebrew letter I, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet.<p>One tittle - The word used here, in the Greek, means literally a little horn, then a point, an extremity. Several of the Hebrew letters were written with small points or apices, as in the Hebrew letter, shin (&#1513;&#1473;  sh), or the Hebrew letter, sin (&#1513;&#1474;  s), which serve to distinguish one letter from another. To change a small point of one letter, therefore, might vary the meaning of a word, and destroy the sense. The name "little horn" was given to these points probably from the manner in which they were written, resembling a little horn. Professor Hackett says of a manuscript which he saw a Jew transcribing: "One peculiarity, that struck me at once as I cast my eye over the parchment, was the horn-like appearance attached to some of the letters. I had seen the same mark, before this, in Hebrew manuscripts, but never where it was so prominent as here. The sign in question, as connected with the Hebrew Letter Lamedh (&#1500;  L) in particular, had almost the appearance of an intentional imitation of a ram's head. It was to that appendage of the Hebrew letters that the Saviour referred when he said, "'Not one jot or little horn' (as the Greek term signifies, which our version renders 'tittle,') 'shall pass from the law until all be fulfilled.'" - Illustrations of Scripture, p. 234. Hence, the Jews were exceedingly cautious in writing these letters, and considered the smallest change or omission a reason for destroying the whole manuscript when they were transcribing the Old Testament. The expression, "one jot or tittle," became proverbial, and means that the smallest part of the law should not be destroyed.<p>The laws of the Jews are commonly divided into moral, ceremonial, and judicial. The moral laws are such as grow out of the nature of things, and which cannot, therefore, be changed - such as the duty of loving God and his creatures. These cannot be abolished, as it can never be made right to hate God, or to hate our fellow-men. Of this kind are the ten commandments, and these our Saviour has neither abolished nor superseded. The ceremonial laws are such as are appointed to meet certain states of society, or to regulate the religious rites and ceremonies of a people. These can be changed when circumstances are changed, and yet the moral law be untouched. A general in an army may command his soldiers to appear sometimes in a red coat and sometimes in blue or in yellow. This would be a ceremonial law, and might be changed as he pleased. The duty of obeying him, and of being faithful to his country, could not be changed.<p>This is a moral law. A parent might permit his children to have 50 different dresses at different times, and love them equally in all. The dress is a mere matter of ceremony, and may be changed. The child, in all these garments, is bound to love and obey his father. This is a moral law, and cannot be changed. So the laws of the Jews. Those designed to regulate mere matters of ceremony and rites of worship might be changed. Those requiring love and obedience to God and love to people could not be changed, and Christ did not attempt it, <a href="/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>; <a href="/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>. A third species of law was the judicial, or those laws regulating courts of justice which are contained in the Old Testament. These were of the nature of the ceremonial law, and might also be changed at pleasure. The judicial law of the Hebrews was adapted to their own civil society. When the form of their polity was changed this was of course no longer binding. The ceremonial law was fulfilled by the coming of Christ: the shadow was lost in the substance, and ceased to be binding. The moral law was confirmed and unchanged. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. For verily I say unto you&#8212;Here, for the first time, does that august expression occur in our Lord's recorded teaching, with which we have grown so familiar as hardly to reflect on its full import. It is the expression manifestly, of supreme legislative authority; and as the subject in connection with which it is uttered is the Moral Law, no higher claim to an authority strictly divine could be advanced. For when we observe how jealously Jehovah asserts it as His exclusive prerogative to give law to men (Le 18:1-5; 19:37; 26:1-4, 13-16, &c.), such language as this of our Lord will appear totally unsuitable, and indeed abhorrent, from any creature lips. When the Baptist's words&#8212;"I say unto you" (Mt 3:9)&#8212;are compared with those of his Master here, the difference of the two cases will be at once apparent.<p>Till heaven and earth pass&#8212;Though even the Old Testament announces the ultimate "perdition of the heavens and the earth," in contrast with the immutability of Jehovah (Ps 102:24-27), the prevalent representation of the heavens and the earth in Scripture, when employed as a popular figure, is that of their stability (Ps 119:89-91; Ec 1:4; Jer 33:25, 26). It is the enduring stability, then, of the great truths and principles, moral and spiritual, of the Old Testament revelation which our Lord thus expresses.<p>one jot&#8212;the smallest of the Hebrew letters.<p>one tittle&#8212;one of those little strokes by which alone some of the Hebrew letters are distinguished from others like them.<p>shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled&#8212;The meaning is that "not so much as the smallest loss of authority or vitality shall ever come over the law." The expression, "till all be fulfilled," is much the same in meaning as "it shall be had in undiminished and enduring honor, from its greatest to its least requirements." Again, this general way of viewing our Lord's words here seems far preferable to that doctrinal understanding of them which would require us to determine the different kinds of "fulfilment" which the moral and the ceremonial parts of it were to have.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Amen I say unto you, </span> so it is in the Greek, a phrase, as some observe never used but by God and Christ himself; who is <span class="ital">the Amen, the faithful and true witness, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a></span>, though the servants of God have sometimes used it, as an adverb of wishing. It is by most concluded a form of an oath, God by it swearing by his truth and faithfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Till heaven and earth pass, </span>& c.; that is, the law is the certain and unchangeable will of God concerning reasonable creatures, and it shall never be altered in the least tittle, nor ever be abolished; you may therefore be secure that I come into the world upon no such errand. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For verily I say unto you,.... Or "I Amen say unto you", which is one of the names of Christ; see <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a> or the word "Amen" is only used by Christ as an asseveration of what he was about to say; and which, for greater confirmation, is usually doubled in the Evangelist John, "Amen, Amen", or "verily, verily". The word is used by the Jews (w) for an oath; they swore by it; and it is a rule with them, that whoever answers "Amen" after an oath, it is all one as if he had pronounced the oath itself. The thing so strongly affirmed in this solemn manner is, <p>till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. The "or jot", in the Greek language, answers to "jod" in the Hebrew, the least of all the letters in the alphabet; hence a little city is called by this name, and this reason is given for it, (x)  , "because that jod is the least among letters". We read also of Rabbi Jod (y), perhaps so called because , he was little, as the author of Juchasin observes (z). This shows in what language the law was written; not in the Samaritan language, for the jod in that is a large letter, but in the Hebrew, in which it is very small; and particularly is written in a very diminutive character, in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a> "by one tittle" some think is meant one of those ducts, dashes, or corners of letters, which distinguish one letter from another, that are much alike; others have thought that one of the pricks or vowel points is intended; others, one of those little strokes in the tops of letters, which the Jews call (a) "crowns" and "spikes", is here meant, in which they imagined great mysteries were contained; and there were some persons among them, who made it their business to search into the meaning of every letter, and of everyone of these little horns, or pricks, that were upon the top of them. So says R. Meir (b), <p>"in the time of the prophets there were such who very diligently searched every letter in the law, and explained every letter by itself; and do not wonder at this that they should expound every letter by itself, for they commented        , upon everyone of the tops of each letter.'' <p>Such an expounder was Akiba ben Joseph (c). To which custom Christ is here supposed to have respect: however, certain it is that he speaks very much in the language, and agreeably to the mind of the Jewish doctors; and some things in their writings will serve to illustrate this passage, <p>"If, (say they (d),) all the nations of the world were gathered together, "to root one word out of the law", they could not do it; which you may learn from Solomon, who sought to root "one letter out of the law", the letter "jod", in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> but the holy blessed God said, Solomon shall cease, and an hundred such as he (in the Talmud (e) it is a thousand such as he)    , "but, jod shall not cease from thee (the law) for ever".'' <p>And elsewhere the same expression is used (f), and it is added, <p>"ljbm ynya Kmm huwqw, "but a tittle from thee shall not perish."'' <p>The design of Christ, in conformity to the language of the Jews, is to declare, that no part of the law, not one of the least commandments in it, as he explains himself in the next verse, should be unaccomplished; but all should be fulfilled before "heaven and earth pass" away, as they will, with a great noise and fervent heat, as to their present form and condition; or sooner shall they pass away, than the least part of the law shall: which expresses the perpetuity of the law, and the impossibility of its passing away, and the superior excellency of it to the heavens and the earth. It is a saying of one of the Jewish doctors (g), that <p>"the whole world is not equal even to one word out of the law,'' <p>in which it is said, there is not one letter deficient or superfluous. <p>(w) T.

Those critics have therefore attached the vowel signs, appropriate to the marginal reading, to the consonants of the corresponding word in the text; e.g. in <a href="/jeremiah/42-6.htm" title="Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.">Jeremiah 42:6</a>, the text exhibits <span class="greekheb">אֲנַוְּ</span>, the margin <span class="greekheb">אנחנו קרי</span>. Here the vowels in the text belong to the word in the margin, which is to be pronounced <span class="greekheb">אֲנַחְנוּ</span>; but in reading the text <span class="greekheb">אנו</span>, the proper vowels must be supplied, making <span class="greekheb">אֲנוּ</span>. A small circle or asterisk over the word in the text always directs to the marginal reading.”—Gesenius, Heb. Gr. Sect. 17.—(I. B.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Cf. <a href="/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail" (Revised Version). The words are so similar that the two evangelists probably record the same utterance, the difference in the form of the sentence pointing rather to an oral than a written common source. St. Luke places it in an attack on the Pharisees, who had scoffed at our Lord for his parable of the dishonest steward. <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>, literally, "established," "sure"). It has hardly been sufficiently noticed by commentators that the New Testament usage of the word "Amen" often slightly differs from that found in the Old Testament. "Amen" in the Old Testament always involves the personal acceptance of the statement to which it refers ("so be it"), whether this be a statement upon oath (<a href="/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, perhaps), or a statement of penalties incurred under certain circumstances (<a href="/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, probably; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); or a statement expressing a pious hope uttered either by another (<a href="/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a> (?); cf. <a href="/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>; cf. also <a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>); or by one's self (<a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>). Hence the LXX. either leaves it untranslated or, with but one exception, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. In Hellenistic Greek, however, it became often used as little more  than a mere asseveration ("verily"). The earliest trace of this usage is found in <a href="/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>, where the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila much better <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, though generally elsewhere <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), and it is frequent in the New Testament, cf. especially <a href="/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, with parallels, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. also <a href="/luke/12-44.htm">Luke 12:44</a> with <a href="/matthew/24-47.htm">Matthew 24:47</a>, and <a href="/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3</a> with <a href="/mark/12-43.htm">Mark 12:43</a>). Yet this usage of "Amen" in Hellenistic Greek does not seem to have ever spread into Hebrew or Aramaic. W. H. Lowe ('Fragm. Pesach.,' p. 70) says, and apparently truly, "The Jews never used 'amen in the sense of 'verily.' They say <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">be'emeth</span>', 'in truth,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hemanutha</span>, 'Faith!' or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span>, '<span class="accented">omnam</span>, 'verily.'" If so, the fact is interesting, for it implies that, notwithstanding the usage of "Amen" in Greek, our Lord himself, as speaking Aramaic, probably did not use it in the mere sense of strong asseveration, but rather always with its connotation of his entire concurrence in the statement he was making. In his mouth, that is to say, it always emphasized the thought of his personal acceptance of the statement with its legitimate issue. Observe that it makes no difference (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>) whether the "Amen" comes at the beginning or at the end of his utterance. N.B. - <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>) may be taken as intermediate between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> states a truth; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> assents with the intellect; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, in at least Hebrew and Aramaic usage, accepts it with all its consequences (cf <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till heaven and earth pass</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">pass away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>); and so in the next clause. The same almost archaic sense of "pass" recurs in <a href="/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>, Authorized Version (Revised Version, "pass away"). Observe that our Lord does not say that the Law will then pass away. He says, not till then; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he affirms, as in <a href="/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, that it is <span class="accented">easier</span> for heaven and earth to pass away than for the Law. For, in fact, as being constantly fulfilled in its ideal and therefore permanent character, it must necessarily remain in the new world; cf. <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> (the everlasting duration of the word of the Lord); <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> (love); <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a> (righteousness); cf. Meyer. The belief in the permanence of the Law which the Jews had (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Meyer, and especially Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect;&sect; 5, 84) here finds its true satisfaction. "The least element of holiness which the Law contains has more reality and durability than the whole visible universe" (Godet on Luke). Comp. also <a href="/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>, "My words shall not pass away" - a claim only seen in its full three when put beside these words about the Law. <span class="cmt_word">One jot</span>. The permanence of even every <span class="accented">yod</span> (<span class="accented">y</span>, <span class="accented">j</span>), though the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is not infrequently referred to by Jewish writers (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.;' Edersheim, 'Life,' 1.537). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of <span class="accented">yod</span>, evidently because of its small size, is one proof of the fact that the Hebrew characters in use in our Lord's time were much more similar to the usual form under which we know them (<span class="accented">Quadrate schrift</span>) than to the form found on the Moabite Stone (Phoenician), where the <span class="accented">god</span> is no smaller than other letters (<span class="accented">vide</span> Euting's very complete table of forms of the Hebrew alphabet in Chwolsen, 'Corp. Inscript. Hebr.,' 1882; <span class="accented">vide</span> pp. 404-415 of the same work for Chwolson's much-controverted theory of the gradual development of the <span class="accented">Quadrat-sehrift</span>, roughly from the time of Ezra till the eighth or  <span class="date">ninth century A.D.</span>, out of old Aramaic forms slightly removed from Phoenician; and for the early history of the Hebrew alphabet generally, see the introduction to Driver's 'Samuel.' <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We may, perhaps, see in our Lord's reference to <span class="accented">yod</span> and a "tittle" an indication that even already scrupulous care was taken of the text. The objection to this, derived from the non-literal quotations in the New Testament is due to a misunderstanding of Jewish methods of quotation. <span class="cmt_word">Or one tittle</span>.

This double use of the Greek word forbids absolute certainty as to what our Lord was referring to, especially as the Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>, literally, "thorn") of which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is a translation has itself a double sense, viz.: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The end of a letter, especially the "thorn-like" small upward stroke of <span class="accented">yod.</span> So most interpreters since Origen (in Wetstein), who says that the Hebrew letters <span class="accented">eaph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>) and <span class="accented">beth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) differ only by a short <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. They also quote the well-known Jewish examples (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Wetstein) of the effect of negligence in writing similar letters; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> if one writes <span class="accented">resh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span>) for <span class="accented">daleth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>), "one" (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) becomes "another;" if <span class="accented">heth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;</span>) for <span class="accented">he</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>), "praise" (<a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>.) becomes  "profane." It must be noticed that the extremities of such Hebrew letters as we possess, which were actually written in our Lord's time on earth, are much more "thorn" "horn"-like than those of our printed texts. I cannot, however, find <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span> actually used in this sense of other letters than <span class="accented">yod.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some distinguishing mark over a letter to indicate care in writing and reading it, or to remind readers of some interpretation or rule attached as a peg to it or to the word of which it forms a part. It was much later, indeed, that such marks became very elaborate, but it is probable that the rudiments of them were known in our Lord's time (for such <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, cf. Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect; 27, 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and the article on Akiba in 'Dict. of Christian Biogr.'). If it be objected that our Lord could hardly refer to these marks of traditional explanation as of such permanence, the answer is that in so far as these expressed legitimate issues (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 21) of the Mosaic Law, he could place them on the same level as that Law itself. <span class="cmt_word">Till all</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">till all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all things in the Law - all the requirements of the Law, in contrast to the one "jot" or "tittle" just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Till all be fulfilled</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be accomplished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The clause is probably epexegetical of "till heaven and earth pass away." Nothing in the Law shall pass away till heaven and earth pass away, when, with a new heaven and earth, all the contents of the Law will be completely realized (cf. Nosgen) so that even then nothing in the Law shall pass away (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). On the contrary, every part of it, moral or ceremonial (Weiss), shall then, by being fully understood and obeyed in its true meaning, enter on its full and complete existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Jot, tittle (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>Jot is for jod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. Tittle is the little bend or point which serves to distinguish certain Hebrew letters of similar appearance.

The guilt of changing those little hooks which distinguish between certain Hebrew letters is declared to be so great that, if such a thing were done, the world would be destroyed. </body></html>
