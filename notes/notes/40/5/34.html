and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>, a formal prohibition of all oaths, either promissory or evidential, and look on the general practice of Christians, and the formal teaching of the Church of England in her Articles (<span class= "ital">Art.</span> xxxix.), as simply an acquiescence in evil. The first impression made by the words is indeed so strongly in their favour that the scruples of such men ought to be dealt with (as English legislation has at last dealt with them) with great tenderness. Their conclusion is, however, it is believed, mistaken: (1) Because, were it true, then in this instance our Lord would be directly repealing part of the moral law given by Moses, instead of completing and expanding it, as in the case of the Sixth and Seventh Commandments. He would be destroying, not fulfilling. (2) Because our Lord himself answered, when He had before been silent, to a solemn formal adjuration (<a href="/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63-64</a>), and St. Paul repeatedly uses such forms of attestation (<a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>). (3) Because the context shows that the sin which our Lord condemned was the light use of oaths in common speech, and with no real thought as to their meaning. Such oaths practically involved irreverence, and were therefore inconsistent with the fear of God. The real purpose of an oath is to intensify that fear by bringing the thought of God’s presence home to men at the very time they take them, and they are therefore rightly used when they attain that end. Practically, it must be admitted that the needless multiplication of oaths, both evidential and promissory, on trivial occasions, has tended, and still tends, to weaken awe and impair men’s reverence for truth, and we may rejoice when their number is diminished. In an ideal Christian society no oaths would be needed, for every word would be spoken as by those who knew that the Eternal Judge was hearing them.<p>(34-35) <span class= "bld">Neither by heaven; . . . nor by the earth; . . . neither by Jerusalem.</span>—Other formulæ of oaths meet us in <a href="/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>. It is not easy at first to understand the thought that underlies such modes of speech. When men swear by God, or the name of Jehovah, there is an implied appeal to the Supreme Ruler. We invoke Him (as in the English form, “So help me God”) to assist and bless us according to the measure of our truthfulness, or to punish us if we speak falsely. But to swear by a <span class= "ital">thing</span> that has no power or life seems almost unintelligible, unless the thing invoked be regarded as endowed in idea with a mysterious holiness and a power to bless and curse. Once in use, it was natural that men under a system like that of Israel, or, we may add, of Christendom, should employ them as convenient symbols intensifying affirmation, and yet not involving the speaker in the guilt of perjury or in the profane utterance of the divine name. Our Lord deals with all such formulæ in the same way. If they have any force at all, it is because they imply a reference to the Eternal. Heaven is His throne, and earth is His footstool (the words are a citation from <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?">Isaiah 66:1</a>), and Jerusalem is the city of the great King. To use them lightly is, therefore, to profane the holy name which they imply. Men do not guard themselves either against irreverence or perjury by such expedients.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:33-37 There is no reason to consider that solemn oaths in a court of justice, or on other proper occasions, are wrong, provided they are taken with due reverence. But all oaths taken without necessity, or in common conversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions which are appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt of swearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; the better they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does not enjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such a constant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I say unto you, Swear not at all - That is, in the manner which he proceeds to specify.

Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself&#8212;These are not the precise words of Ex 20:7; but they express all that it was currently understood to condemn, namely, false swearing (Le 19:12, &c.). This is plain from what follows.<p>But I say unto you, Swear not at all&#8212;That this was meant to condemn swearing of every kind and on every occasion&#8212;as the Society of Friends and some other ultra-moralists allege&#8212;is not for a moment to be thought. For even Jehovah is said once and again to have sworn by Himself; and our Lord certainly answered upon oath to a question put to Him by the high priest; and the apostle several times, and in the most solemn language, takes God to witness that he spoke and wrote the truth; and it is inconceivable that our Lord should here have quoted the precept about not forswearing ourselves, but performing to the Lord our oaths, only to give a precept of His own directly in the teeth of it. Evidently, it is swearing in common intercourse and on frivolous occasions that is here meant. Frivolous oaths were indeed severely condemned in the teaching of the times. But so narrow was the circle of them that a man might swear, says Lightfoot, a hundred thousand times and yet not be guilty of vain swearing. Hardly anything was regarded as an oath if only the name of God were not in it; just as among ourselves, as Trench well remarks, a certain lingering reverence for the name of God leads to cutting off portions of His name, or uttering sounds nearly resembling it, or substituting the name of some heathen deity, in profane exclamations or asseverations. Against all this our Lord now speaks decisively; teaching His audience that every oath carries an appeal to God, whether named or not.<p>neither by heaven; for it is God's throne&#8212;(quoting Isa 66:1);<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/5-36.htm" title="Neither shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.">Matthew 5:36</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I say unto you, swear not at all,.... Which must not be understood in the strictest sense, as though it was not lawful to take an oath upon any occasion, in an affair of moment, in a solemn serious manner, and in the name of God; which may be safely done: but of rash swearing, about trivial matters, and by the creatures; as appears by what follows, <p>neither by heaven; which is directly contrary to the Jewish canons (m), which say, <p>"they that swear  "by heaven", and by earth, are free.'' <p>Upon the words in Sol 2:7, "I adjure you", &amp;c. it is asked (n), <p>"by what does she adjure them? R. Eliezer says, by the heavens, and by the earth; by the hosts, the host above, and the host below.'' <p>So Philo the Jew says (o) that the most high and ancient cause need not to be immediately mentioned in swearing; but the "earth", the sun, the stars,  "heaven", and the whole world. So R. Aben Ezra, and R. David Kimchi, explain <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>. "The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness"; that is, say they,  "by heaven": which may be thought to justify them, in this form of swearing; though they did not look upon it as a binding oath, and therefore if broken they were not criminal (p). <p>"He that swears by heaven, and by the earth, and by the sun, and the like; though his intention is nothing less than to him that created them, this is no oath.'' <p>The reason why it is forbidden by Christ to swear by heaven, is, <p>for it is God's throne; referring to <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a> where he sits, the glory of his majesty shines forth, and is itself glorious and excellent, and not to be mentioned in a vain way; and especially, for the reason Christ elsewhere gives, <a href="/matthew/23-22.htm">Matthew 23:22</a> that "he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon"; so that they doubly sinned, first, by openly swearing by that which is God's creature; and then, by tacitly bringing God into their rash and vain oaths. <p>(m) Misn.

Hal. 1847). The simple prohibition,—given, however, to the disciples, and for the life of fellowship of true believers,—and in so far not less <span class="ital">ideal</span> than the requirements that have preceded, appears from the words themselves (comp. <a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>), and also from <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a>. Christianity as it <span class="ital">should</span> be according to the will of Christ, should know <span class="ital">no oath at all:</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ μὴ ὀμνύειν ὅλως ἐπιτείνει μάλιστα τὴν εὐσέβειαν</span>, Euth. Zigabenus. To the consciousness of the Christian, God should always be so vividly present, that, to him and others in the Christian community, his yea and nay are, in point of reliability, equivalent to an oath. His yea and nay are oath enough. Comp. on <span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, <span class="ital">prorsus</span> (= <span class="greekheb">παντελῶς</span>, Hesychius), Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. i. 2. 35: <span class="greekheb">προαγορεύομεν τοῖς νέοις ὅλως μὴ διαλέγεσθαι</span>, Oecon. <a href="/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>. Accordingly, it is only in the incomplete temporal condition of Christianity, as well as in the relation to the world in which it is placed, and to the existing relations of the department of public law, to which it conforms itself, that the oath has its necessary, indeed (comp. <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm" title="For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.">Hebrews 6:16</a>), but conditional and temporary existence. <span class="ital">Christ</span> Himself has sworn (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a> f.); <span class="ital">Paul</span> has frequently sworn (<a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a> f.; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>); nay, <span class="ital">God</span> swears to His own people (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm" title="Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father;">Genesis 26:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-23.htm" title="Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:">Numbers 14:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="/luke/1-73.htm" title="The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,">Luke 1:73</a>; <a href="/acts/7-17.htm" title="But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,">Acts 7:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm" title="For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,">Hebrews 6:13</a>). Therefore Anabaptists and Quakers are wrong in rejecting an oath <span class="ital">without any exception</span>, as was already done by Justin, Irenaeus, Clement, Origen, Chrysostom, Jerome, and other Fathers. The various but altogether arbitrary explanations of those who here recognise no absolute prohibition may be seen in Tholuck. The <span class="ital">direct</span> oath, <span class="ital">by God</span>, is not indeed expressly mentioned along with others in what follows; its prohibition, however, is implied, just as a matter of course, and entirely, first of all in the general <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως</span>, as it is the reference to God which constitutes precisely the fundamental conception and nature of the oath, and, as in the doctrine here discussed, <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a>, the direct oath is contained not only in <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐπιορκ</span>., according to <a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>, but also expressly in <span class="greekheb">ἀποδώσεις τῷ κυρίῳ</span>, etc. If Christ, therefore, had intended to forbid merely the oaths of common life, He would, instead of the altogether general statement, <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως</span>, have made use of a form of expression excluding oaths to be taken in relation to the magistracy (probably by a <span class="greekheb">παρεκτός</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>). It is true, indeed, that in the special prohibitions which follow, He mentions only indirect oaths,—consequently not those that are valid in a court of justice,—but just because the prohibition of the direct oath was already contained in <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμός</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, first of all and before all other kinds of oaths; and His object now is simply to set forth that even indirect swearing fell under the general prohibition of swearing. And He sets this forth in such a way, that in so doing the prohibition of the direct oath forms <span class="ital">the presupposition</span> of His demonstration, as it could not otherwise be expected after <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως</span>. What a scanty <span class="greekheb">πλήρωσις</span> of the law—and one altogether out of keeping with the ideal character of the points which preceded—would it have been had Jesus only intended to say: I forbid you “<span class="ital">the wanton oaths of the streets, of the markets</span>” (Keim), in all their forms!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήτε ἐν τῷ οὐρ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">not</span> to swear in general, <span class="ital">nor</span> (specially) by heaven, <span class="ital">nor</span> by earth.

Again an unqualified statement, to be taken not in the letter as a new law, but in the spirit as inculcating such a love of truth that so far as we are concerned there shall be no need of oaths. In civil life the most truthful man has to take an oath because of the untruth and consequent distrust prevailing in the world, and in doing so he does not sin against Christ’s teaching. Christ Himself took an oath before the High Priest (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>). What follows (<a href="/context/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:...">Matthew 5:34-36</a>) is directed against the casuistry which laid stress on the words <span class="greekheb">τῷ κυρίῳ</span>, and evaded obligation by taking oaths in which the divine name was not mentioned: by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, or by one’s own head. Jesus points out that all such oaths involved a reference to God. This is sufficiently obvious in the case of the first three, not so clear in case of the fourth.—<span class="greekheb">λευκὴν ἢ μέλαιναν</span>: white is the colour of old age, black of youth. We cannot alter the colour of our hair so as to make our head look young or old. <span class="ital">A fortiori</span> we cannot bring on our head any curse by perjury, of which hair suddenly whitened might be the symbol. Providence alone can blast our life. The oath by the head is a direct appeal to God. All these oaths are binding, therefore, says Jesus; but what I most wish to impress on you is: do not swear at all. Observe the use of <span class="greekheb">μήτε</span> (not <span class="greekheb">μηδέ</span>) to connect these different evasive oaths as forming a homogeneous group. Winer, sect. Leviticus 6, endorses the view of Herrmann in Viger that <span class="greekheb">οὔτε</span> and <span class="greekheb">μήτε</span> are <span class="ital">adjunctival</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> and <span class="greekheb">μηδέ</span> <span class="ital">disjunctival</span>, and says that the latter add negation to negation, while the former divide a single negation into parts. Jesus first thinks of these evasive oaths as a bad class, then specifies them one after the other. Away with them one and all, and let your word be <span class="greekheb">ναὶ ναί</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὒ οὔ</span>. That is, if you want to give assurance, let it not be by an oath, but by simple repetition of your <span class="ital">yes</span> and <span class="ital">no</span>. Grotius interprets: let your yea or nay in <span class="ital">word</span> be a yea or nay in <span class="ital">deed</span>, be as good as your word even unsupported by an oath. This brings the version of Christ’s saying in Mt. into closer correspondence with <a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>—<span class="greekheb">ἤτω τὸ Ναί ναὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ Οὔ οὔ</span>. Beza, with whom Achelis (<span class="ital">Bergpredigt</span>) agrees, renders, “Let your affirmative discourse be a simple yea, and your negative, nay”.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ περισσὸν</span>, the surplus, what goes beyond these simple words.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ</span>, hardly “from the evil one,” though many ancient and modern interpreters, including Meyer, have so understood it. Meyer says the neuter “of evil” gives a very insipid meaning. I think, however, that Christ expresses Himself mildly out of respect for the necessity of oaths in a world full of falsehood. I know, He means to say, that in certain circumstances something beyond yea and nay will be required of you. But it comes of evil, the evil of untruthfulness. See that the evil be not in you. Chrysostom (Hom. xvii.) asks: How evil, if it be God’s law? and answers: Because the law was good in its season. God acted like a nurse who gives the breast to an infant and afterwards laughs at it when it wants it after weaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">Swear not at all</span>] The prohibition must be understood of rash and careless oaths in conversation, not of solemn asseveration in Courts of Justice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for it is God’s throne</span>] Such was the prevalent hypocrisy that the Jews of the day thought that they escaped the sin of perjury if in their oaths they avoided using the name of God. One of the Rabbinical sayings was “As heaven and earth shall pass away, so passeth away the oath taken by them.” Our Lord shows that a false oath taken by heaven, by earth, or by Jerusalem is none the less a profanation of God’s name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hypocrisy reproduces itself. Louis XI. “admitted to one or two peculiar forms of oath the force of a binding obligation which he denied to all others, strictly preserving the secret, which mode of swearing he really accounted obligatory, as one of the most valuable of state mysteries.” Introd. to <span class="ital">Quentin Durward</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως</span>, <span class="ital">not to swear at all</span>) The <span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, <span class="ital">at all</span>, extends this prohibition to swearing truly as well as falsely: it does not, however, universally prohibit all true swearing. The right employment of oaths is not only like divorce permitted but clearly established by the law, nor is it here abolished by Christ; see <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>. But the abuse of oaths was extremely frequent with the Jews of that age, to the destruction of their legitimate use, as is clear from the forms of swearing cited in this passage; nor did they think him guilty of perjury who called only <span class="ital">creatures</span> to witness in his oath, however falsely he might swear. See Samuel Petit,[214] Variae Lectiones, ch. 16. The following decree of the Jews is to be found in Elle Schemoth Rabba,[215] section 44, <span class="ital">As heaven and earth shall pass away, so shall the oath pass away which calls them to witness</span>. There is clearly, however, a prohibition, whilst the prevalent[216] abuse of oaths is forbidden, and their true use restored. Many of the ancient Christians received this command simply and literally, and so much the more readily declined the heathen oaths which they were commanded to take. See however, <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-8.htm" title="But, The LORD lives, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries where I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.">Jeremiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>, the last of which passages refers to Christian times. On the contrary, there is now-a-days a great danger lest a very small proportion of the number that are made be true, and of the true a very small proportion necessary, and of those that are necessary a very small proportion free, fruitful, holy, and joyful. Many are employed for show, for calumny, for silencing just suspicions.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, <span class="ital">by</span>) That which is sworn by is offered in pledge: it should therefore be in the power of him who swears. He who swears wrongly (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-36.htm" title="Neither shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.">Matthew 5:36</a>) is guilty of sacrilege. Therefore, in this sense a man ought not to swear by God, because, in case of his swearing falsely, he pledges himself to renounce God. This, however, it is not in his power to do. But we must swear in that manner which is sanctioned in the Divine law itself, so that our oath should be an invocation of the Divine name. Even the customary formula, <span class="ital">So help me God</span>, is not to be taken in the former but in the latter sense, so that the emphasis should fall upon the word GOD. This interpretation is at any rate favourable to him who swears, and makes the matter rather easier.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ οὐρανῷ</span>, <span class="ital">by heaven</span>) How much greater is their sin who swear by God Himself!—<span class="greekheb">θρόνος</span>, <span class="ital">throne</span>) How great is the majesty of God! God is not enclosed by heaven, but His glory is especially manifested there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[214] A celebrated scholar, born at Nîsmes in 1594, studied at Geneva, raised at an early age to the Professorship of Theology and of Greek and Hebrew in that city.

Yet, as St. Augustine points out, St. Paul took oaths in his writings (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>); and our Lord himself did not refuse to answer when put upon his oath (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63, 64</a>). He, that is to say, and St. Paul after him, accepted the fact that there are times when a solemn oath must be taken. How, then, can we explain this absolute prohibition here? In that our Lord is not here thinking at all of formal and solemn oaths, but of oaths as the outcome of impatience and exaggeration. The thoughtlessness of fervent asseveration is often betrayed into an oath. Such an oath, or even any asseveration that passes in spirit beyond "yea, yea," "nay, nay," has its origin <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; cf. Chaucer, "Sweryng sodeynly without avysement is eek a gret synne" ('Parson's Tale,' &sect; 'De Ira'). Martensen, however ('Ethics, Individual,' &sect; 100), takes the prohibition of oaths as formally unconditional and total, in accordance with the highest ideal of what man will hereafter be and require, and he sees the limitation, which he allows is to be given to these words, in the present conditions of human society. We have an ideal duty towards God, but we have also a practical duty to those among whom we live, and the present state of human affairs permits and necessitates oaths. Hence it was that even Christ submitted to them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither by heaven</span>, etc. Our Lord further defines what he means by an oath. It does not mean only an expression in which God's Name is mentioned, but any expression appealing to any object at all, whether this be supraterrestrial, terrestrial, national, or personal. Although God's Name is often omitted in such cases, from a feeling of reverence, its omission does not prevent the asseveration being an oath. <span class="accented">Heaven</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the heaven</span>; for the thought is clearly not the immaterial transcendental heaven, the abode of bliss, but the physical heaven (cf. <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Heaven...  footstool</span>.
