The usage of the time, however, confined the word to the moral laws of God (as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-23.htm" title="In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.">Ecclesiasticus 32:23-24</a>), and throughout the New Testament it is never used in any other sense, with the possible exception of <a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a> (comp. especially <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). And the context, which proceeds at once to deal with moral laws and does not touch on ceremonial, is in accordance with this meaning. The “least commandments,” then, are those which seemed trivial, yet were really great—the control of thoughts, desires, words, as compared with the apparently greater commands that dealt with acts. The reference to “teaching” shows that our Lord was speaking to His disciples, as the future instructors of mankind, and the obvious import of His words is that they were to raise, not lower, the standard of righteousness which had been recognised previously.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.</span>—The consequence of tampering with the great laws of duty, or the least laws, which are practically great, is described in terms at once severe and gentle; gentle, because the sentence, where the guilt is not wilful, or is repented of, is not one of absolute exclusion from the kingdom; severe in so far as being the “least” in that kingdom, the object of pity or sorrow to others, involved a severe humiliation to those who aimed at being the highest. To that condemnation many in every age of the Church have been liable, the Anthiomian fanatic and the Jesuit casuist standing so far on the same footing.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall do and teach.</span>—Here again the teaching work of the disciples is prominent. The combination is in this case even more significant than in the other. Not right doing only, still less right teaching only, but both together, made up the ideal of the preacher’s work.<p><span class= "bld">Great.</span>—Not “greatest.” The avoidance of the latter word, interpreted by the later teaching of 18:4, would seem to have been deliberate. Men might aim at a positive standard of the greatness of the true teacher and the true worker, but the conscious aim at being “greatest” was self-frustrating. That honour belonged to him only who was all unconscious that he had any claim to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-19.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whosoever therefore shall break </span>— Shall himself transgress in his practice, or pervert and weaken by his doctrine, <span class="ital">one of these least</span> <span class="ital">commandments, and teach men so </span>— Shall direct or encourage men to do the same, or shall teach them, either by word or example, that the obligation of these commands is dissolved; <span class="ital">he shall be called </span>— Or, <span class="ital">shall be accounted </span>one of <span class="ital">the least, </span>and unworthiest members <span class="ital">in the kingdom of heaven </span>— Or, Church of the Messiah, and shall soon be entirely cut off from it, as unfit for so holy a society, and shall have no part in the church triumphant. “There is in the text a figure, which the rhetoricians call <span class="greekheb">μειωσις</span>, <span class="ital">diminution, </span>often elegantly used to convey a strong idea.

No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man, pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same, whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in a man's temper and conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whosoever therefore shall break - Shall violate or disobey.<p>One of these least commandments - The Pharisees, it is probable, divided the precepts of the law into lesser and greater, teaching that they who violated the former were guilty of a trivial offence only. See <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>. Christ teaches that in his kingdom they who make this distinction, or who taught that any laws of God might be violated with impunity, should be called least; while they should be held in high regard who observed all the laws of God without distinction.<p>Shall be called least - That is, shall be least. See <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>. The meaning of this passage seems to be this: in the kingdom of heaven, that is, in the kingdom of the Messiah, or in the church which he is about to establish (see the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>), he that breaks the least of these commandments shall be in no esteem, or shall not be regarded as a proper religious teacher. The Pharisees, by dividing the law into greater and lesser precepts, made no small part of it void by their traditions and divisions, <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3-6</a>. Jesus says that in his kingdom all this vain division and tradition would cease. Such divisions and distinctions would be a small matter. He that attempted it should be the least of all. People would be engaged in yielding obedience to all the law of God without any such vain distinctions.<p>Shall be called great - He that teaches that all the law of God is binding, and that the whole of it should be obeyed, without attempting to specify what is most important, shall be a teacher worthy of his office, and shall be called great. Hence, we learn:<p>1. that all the law of God is binding on Christians. Compare <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>.<p>2. that all the commands of God should be preached, in their proper place, by Christian ministers.<p>3. that they who pretend that there are any laws of God so small that they need not obey them, are unworthy of his kingdom. And,<p>4. that true piety has respect to all the commandments of God.

Which are to be understood not of the beatitudes in the preceding verses, for these were not delivered by Christ under the form of commandments; nor of any of the peculiar commands of Christ under the Gospel dispensation; but of the precepts of the law, of which some were comparatively lesser than others; and might be said to be broke, loosed, or dissolved, as the word here used signifies, when men acted contrary to them. <p>And shall teach men so; not only teach them by their example to break the commandments, but by express orders: for however gross and absurd this may seem to be, that there should be any such teachers, and they should have any hearers, yet such there were among the Jews; and our Lord here manifestly strikes at them: for notwithstanding the great and excellent things they say of the law, yet they tell us, that the doctors of the sanhedrim had power to root anything out of the law; to loose or make void any of its commands, for a time, excepting in the case of idolatry; and so might any true prophet, or wise man; which they pretend is sometimes necessary for the glory of God, and the good of men; and they are to be heard and obeyed, when they say, transgress anyone of all the commands which are in the law (h). Maimonides says (i), that the sanhedrim had power, when it was convenient, for the time present, to make void an affirmative command, and to transgress a negative one, in order to return many to their religion; or to deliver many of the Israelites from stumbling at other things, they may do whatsoever the present time makes necessary: for so, adds he, the former wise men say, a man may profane one sabbath, in order to keep many sabbaths. And elsewhere (k) he affirms, <p>"if a prophet, whom we know to be a prophet, should order us    , "to transgress anyone of the commands", which are mentioned in the law, or many commands, whether light or heavy, for a time, we are ordered to hearken to him; and so we learn from the former wise men, by tradition, that in everything a prophet shall say to thee   , "transgress the words of the law", as Elias on Mount Carmel, hear him, except in the case of idolatry.'' <p>And another of their writers says (l), <p>"it is lawful sometimes to make void the law, and to do that which appears to be forbidden.'' <p>Nay, they even (m) say, that if a Gentile should bid an Israelite transgress anyone of the commands mentioned in the law, excepting idolatry, adultery, and murder, he may transgress with impunity, provided it is done privately. You see what reason Christ had to express himself in the manner he does, and that with resentment, saying, <p>he shall be called, or be  <p>the least in the kingdom of heaven; meaning either the church of God, where he shall have neither a name, nor place; he shall not be in the least esteemed, but shall be cast out as a worthless man; or the ultimate state of happiness and glory, in the other world, where he shall not enter, as is said in the next verse; but, on the other hand, <p>whosoever shall do and teach; whose doctrine and conversation, principles and practices agree together; who both teach obedience to the law, and perform it themselves: where again he glances at the masters in Israel, and tacitly reproves them who said, but did not; taught the people what they themselves did not practise; and so were unworthy of the honour, which he that both teaches and does shall have: for <p>the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven; he shall be highly esteemed of in the church here, and be honoured hereafter in the world to come. The Jews have a saying somewhat like this; <p>"he that lessens himself for the words of the law in this world, , "he shall become great" in the world to come (n),'' <p>or days of the Messiah. <p>(h) T.

Köstlin and Hilgenfeld find here a very distinct disapproval of the Apostle Paul and of the <span class="ital">Paulinites</span>, who break free from the law; nay, Paul, thinks Köstlin, was actually <span class="ital">named</span> by Jewish Christians the smallest (<a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>), as he so names himself (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>). A purely imaginary combination.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/5-19.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἐὰν οὖν λύσῃ</span>, etc.: <span class="greekheb">οὗν</span> pointing to a natural inference from what goes before. Christ’s view being such as indicated, He must so judge of the setter aside of any laws however small. When a religious system has lasted long, and is wearing towards its decline and fall, there are always such men. The Baptist was in some respects such a man. He seems to have totally neglected the temple worship and sacred festivals. He shared the prophetic disgust at formalism. Note now what Christ’s judgment about such really is. A scribe or Pharisee would regard a breaker of even the least commandments as a miscreant. Jesus simply calls him the <span class="ital">least</span> in the Kingdom of Heaven. He takes for granted that he is an earnest man, with a passion for righteousness, which is the key to his iconoclastic conduct. He recognises him therefore as possessing real moral worth, but, in virtue of his impatient radical-reformer temper, not great, only little in the scale of true moral values, in spite of his earnestness in action and sincerity in teaching. John the Baptist was possibly in His mind, or some others not known to us from the Gospels.—<span class="greekheb">ὃς δʼ ἂν ποιήσῃ καὶ διδάξῃ</span>, etc. We know now who is least: who is great? The man who does and teaches to do all the commands great and small; great not named but understood—<span class="greekheb">οὗτος μέγας</span>. Jesus has in view O. T. saints, the piety reflected in the Psalter, where the great ethical laws and the precepts respecting ritual are both alike respected, and men in His own time living in their spirit. In such was a sweetness and graciousness, akin to the Kingdom as He conceived it, lacking in the character of the hot-headed law-breaker. The geniality of Jesus made Him value these sweet saintly souls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. Again addressed to the Apostles as teachers. The union of doing and teaching is essential. It was the grave sin of the Pharisees that they taught without doing.

In this verse our Lord once for all declares his opposition to antinomianism. Every one of the commands in the Law is, in its true and ideal meaning, still binding. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). Not merely in contrast to "do" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) in the sense of "transgress" (Fritzsche), but "abrogate" (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>, "Not the violation of the sanctity of the day in a special case, but the abrogation of the duty of observance;" cf. also <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). It expresses, indeed, a less complete abrogation than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 17), because, while speaking of himself, the Lord could use the strongest word possible, and that with reference to the whole Law or the Prophets; but here his expression is limited by the inability of any individual disciple to carry out an abrogation even of one command<span class="cmt_word">. One of these least commandments.</span> Not necessarily such as the Pharisees reckoned least, in their enumeration of small and great, but such as our Lord himself symbolized by "jot" or "tittle;" those precepts which in reality are the least important (Meyer). Chrysostom strangely says that our Lord here refers, not to old laws, but to those which he was about to lay down; similarly Bengel thinks of vers. 22-28, etc. While the Jews distinguished carefully between small and great precepts, they insisted on the importance of keeping even the smallest; cf. 'Ab.,' 4:5 (Taylor), "Hasten to a slight precept.., for the reward of precept is precept." <span class="cmt_word">And shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach men so.</span> Doing his best to abrogate it, not only in his own person by neglect or violation, but also for others by teaching them to disregard it. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be called the least</span>. The Revised Version omits "he, .... the." He is not cast out of the kingdom ("Ubi nisi magni esse non possunt," Augustine), but his want of moral insight (did he consider it "breadth of thought"?) leads to his being called <span class="accented">least</span> in the kingdom. It is the converse of the parable in <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc. There faithfulness in a very little (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>) wins much; here disregard of a very little causes a person to be reckoned (ver. 9, note) as very little - the principle of judgment being that of <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in avery little is unrighteous also in much." <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably in its full and final establishment. The doctrine of grades of blessedness and of punishment hereafter is clearly taught in Scripture (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But whosoever shall do and teach them</span>. Similarly the Revised Version; but rather supply "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is required in the smallest commandment" (Meyer). The personal performance and conscious spreading of one of the least commandments will be found to involve so much that it gains for the person a high position. <span class="cmt_word">Do and teach</span>. For many will perform a command without taking any conscious part in spreading it. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">same;</span> Revised Version, he (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Why inserted here and not in the previous clause? Partly because of the awkwardness of inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there so soon after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>; partly because our Lord wished to lay stress there on the recompense, here on the person ("he and no other") who receives recompense. On the thought, cf. 'Test. XII. Parr.' (Levi., &sect; 13), "If he teach these things and practise them, he shall share the throne of the king, as also Joseph our brother." It is worth adding Tyndale's remark in his 'Exposition,' "Whosoever shall first fulfil them  [these least commandments following] himself, and then teach other, and set all his study to the furtherance and maintaining of them, that doctor shall all they of the kingdom of heaven have in price, and follow him and seek him out, as doth an eagle her prey, and cleave to him as burrs." </body></html>
