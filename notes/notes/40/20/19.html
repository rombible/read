The Master looked beyond the suffering to the victory over death, but the disciples could not enter into the meaning of the words that spoke of it. St. Luke, indeed (as if he had gathered from some of those who heard them what had been their state of feeling at the time), reports that “they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither understood they the things that were spoken” (<a href="/luke/18-34.htm" title="And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.">Luke 18:34</a>).

And here, as before, he adds the mention of his resurrection and his glory, to that of his death and sufferings, to encourage his disciples, and comfort them. A believing view of our once crucified and now glorified Redeemer, is good to humble a proud, self-justifying disposition. When we consider the need of the humiliation and sufferings of the Son of God, in order to the salvation of perishing sinners, surely we must be aware of the freeness and richness of Divine grace in our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem - Jesus assured them that what they feared would come to pass, but he had, in some measure, prepared their minds for this state of suffering by the promises which he had made to them, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27-30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>.

Among other things, he says he shall be "spitefully entreated;" that is, treated with spite or malice; malice, implying contempt. These sufferings of our Saviour, and this treatment, and his death, had been predicted in many places.

Mark saith, <span class="ital">that as they went Jesus went</span> <span class="ital">before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were</span> <span class="ital">afraid.</span> Mark gives us no account of any formidable object in their eye. Those that think they were amazed to see him make such haste to his death, forget that Luke saith, that after our Saviour had further instructed them in this, they understood it not; but probably they knew he was going into the nest of his enemies, and this made them afraid. He calls to him the twelve, (it was not a discourse fit for a multitude), and gives them an account very particularly of what he had twice or thrice before taught them: He had before told them of his death and resurrection, and that he should be betrayed to death; here he describes the manner, they should deliver him to the Gentiles (to Pilate and Herod); he describes his previous sufferings, he should be scourged, mocked, spit upon, and the kind of his death, he should be crucified; that when these things came to pass, they might be assured that he was God, who had so punctually foretold things to come, not existent in their causes, but mere contingencies. He comforteth them with two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That it was according to what had been foretold by the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That though he died, he should rise again the third day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They had need of this forewarning for a forearming; for considering that they now looked upon him as the Messiah, it might well pose them to think how he should die; and when they had seen all these things come to pass, it might have shaken their faith; but being so particularly foretold, the coming of them to pass rather confirmed their faith in him as the Son of God than weakened it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But Luke saith, <span class="ital">they understood none of these things; </span> that is, surely they believed none of them, <span class="ital">the saying was hid from them.</span> The words were plain enough, but they could not reconcile them to their reason, they could not conceive how he who was the Messiah could die; nor get over the prejudice of his being a temporal prince, and exercising a kingdom in this world. For his rising again the third day, they could not believe it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles,.... To Pilate, an Heathen governor, and to the Roman officers and soldiers under him; see <a href="/john/18-35.htm">John 18:35</a>. <p>To mock him, as they did, by putting on him a scarlet robe, platting a crown of thorns, and placing it on his head, and a reed in his hand; and then bowed the knee to him, and cried, hail, king of the Jews! <p>and to scourge him: as he was by Pilate, at least by his orders: Mark adds, "and spit upon him"; as not only did the Jews in the palace of the high priest, but also the Gentiles, the Roman soldiers, after they had mocked him in the manner before described: <p>and to crucify him: which, as it was a cruel and shameful death, such as slaves and the worst of malefactors were put to, so it was a Roman one; for which reason, the Jews choose to deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. The Persic version here adds, "and put him into the grave": which though it followed his crucifixion, was not done by the Gentiles, but by Joseph of Arimathea, a Jew, and a disciple of Jesus; and that not in a contemptuous, but honourable manner <p>and the third day he shall rise again: this he said for the comfort of his disciples; but now, though these things were so clearly and distinctly expressed by Christ, and which show his omniscience, and give proof both of his deity and Messiahship, yet Luke observes of the disciples, "that they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken": the words were plain, the grammatical sense of them was easy, but they could not imagine that they were to be taken literally; which was such a glaring contradiction to their received and rooted principles of the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, and the grandeur of it, that they fancied these expressions carried a mystical, secret meaning in them, which they were not masters of: and certain it is, that what our Lord now said, was so far from destroying, or weakening these prejudices of theirs, that it rather confirmed them in them; particularly, what he said about rising again, which seemed to have put them afresh in mind, and to excite their hopes of this external felicity, as appears from the following case. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify <i>him</i>: and the third day he shall rise again.</span><p>(4) The shame of the cross is the sure way to the glory of everlasting life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμπαῖξαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">μαστιγῶσαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">σταυρῶσαι</span>, mock, scourge, crucify; all new features, the details of the <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ παθεῖν</span>.

The fact of his death he had impressed upon his apostles, but the mode had. not been mentioned; such an unexpected, awful, and ignomiuious close was incredible. and needed special preparation ere it could be received as true. Intimations, indeed, of such a death had been given darkly, when his disciples were told that they must take up the cross and follow him, or when he spoke of being "lifted up" like the serpent in the wilderness (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>); but his words were not understood; they fell upon ears prejudiced to a certain erroneous conviction, which events alone could eradicate. <span class="cmt_word">He shall rise again</span> (see on Matthew 16:21). It seems to us almost incredible that, after all that Christ said here and elsewhere, his resurrection should have come upon his followers as a surprise which they could not believe without tangible proof. But when we read of their dulness and unbelief; we are constrained to admire the candour and sincerity of narrators, who record such facts to their discredit without evasion or apology. As St. Luke says, "They understood none of these things; and this saying was hid  from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken." </body></html>
