That nearness to Him in His glory could be obtained only by an equal nearness in suffering. Had they counted the cost of that nearness?<p><span class= "bld">To drink of the cup that I shall drink of.</span>—The words that follow, “to be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with,” are not found in many of the best MSS., and have probably been added to bring St. Matthew’s narrative into harmony with St. Mark’s. For the sake of completeness, however, they will be examined here. And (1) we have the question, How did the two disciples understand our Lord’s words? We are familiar with their meaning. Was it equally clear to them? As far as the cup is concerned, there can be little doubt that any reader of the Old Testament would at once recognise it as the symbol of a good or evil fortune. There was the “cup running over” of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>, the “wine-cup of fury” of <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, the “cup of astonishment and desolation” of <a href="/ezekiel/23-33.htm" title="You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.">Ezekiel 23:33</a>. The meaning of the “baptism” was, perhaps, less obvious (see Note on <a href="/matthew/20-29.htm" title="And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.">Matthew 20:29</a>, on our Lord’s use of the symbolism), yet here also there were the overwhelming “proud waters” of <a href="/psalms/124-5.htm" title="Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.">Psalm 124:5</a>, the “waves and billows” of <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>. The very verb, “to baptize” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to plunge into the deep), was used by Josephus for the destruction of a city (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 3, § 3), by the LXX. for “terrifying” in <a href="/isaiah/21-4.htm" title="My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure has he turned into fear to me.">Isaiah 21:4</a>. Our Lord Himself had already used it in dim mysterious reference to His coming passion (<a href="/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a>, where see Note). There was enough, then, to lead them to see in their Master’s words an intimation of some great suffering about to fall on Him, and this is, indeed, implied in the very form of their answer. “We are able,” they say, in the tone of those who have been challenged and accept the challenge. That their insight into the great mystery of the passion went but a little way as compared with their Master’s, lies, of course, in the very nature of the case. When the beloved disciple, in after years, taught by his own experience and by his brother’s death (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.">Acts 12:2</a>), thought over the words, “Let this cup pass from Me” (26:39), he must have seen somewhat more clearly into its depth of meaning.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:20-28 The sons of Zebedee abused what Christ said to comfort the disciples. Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Pride is a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdo others in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition of their request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings. It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but not the cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh 18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa 48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it is given, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquainted with the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desire of greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, but something of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours most diligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to his brethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ, and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks of his death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is a sacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantial sacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented. It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, if for many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye know not what ye ask - You do not know the nature of your request, nor what would be involved in it.<p>You suppose that it would be attended only with honor and happiness if the request was granted, whereas it would require much suffering and trial.<p>Are ye able to drink of the cup ... - To drink of a cup, in the Scriptures, often signifies to be afflicted, or to be punished, <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>.

Our Saviour gently reproves them for their unadvised petition, and again minds them, that he was first to suffer, and then to enter into his glory, and that by much tribulation they also must enter into the kingdom of God; which was a thing fitter for their present thoughts, than sitting at his right hand and left hand, for we must <span class="ital">suffer with him, </span> if we will be <span class="ital">glorified together, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a></span>.

Christ here expresses his sufferings under the notion of drinking of a cup, and being baptized with a baptism. A <span class="ital">cup</span> is an ordinary metaphor in holy writ, by which a man’s portion in this life is expressed, whether it be a portion of good things or evil, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/11-6.htm" title="On the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.">Psalm 11:6</a> <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a> <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a> <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a> <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>,42Jo 18:11</span>. Drinking of a cup is usually put for suffering, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and are you he that shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.">Jeremiah 49:12</a> <a href="/ezekiel/23-32.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.">Ezekiel 23:32</a> <a href="/obadiah/1-16.htm" title="For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.">Obadiah 1:16</a></span>. The metaphor being, as some think, taken from a custom in some nations, to put malefactors to death by giving them a cup of poison to drink; or, as others think, from the lewd custom, at competitions to force men to drink off their cups. To be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with</span> hath the same import: see <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a></span>. Afflictions are ordinarily compared in Scripture to waters: to be baptized, is to be dipped in water; metaphorically, to be plunged in afflictions. I am, saith Christ, to be baptized with blood, overwhelmed with sufferings and afflictions; are you able to be so? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They say unto him, We are able.</span> This was as rashly spoken as the other.

To her two sons, <p>ye know not what ye ask. They were ignorant of the nature of Christ's kingdom, which is spiritual, and not of this world: or they would never have asked such a question, or sued for that which will never be enjoyed by any and supposing that Christ's kingdom had been such as they imagined, yet in asking for honours and riches, they might not know what they asked for; they might promise themselves much pleasure and happiness in the enjoyment of them, and yet, if indulged with them, might be disappointed, and find unexpected troubles and uneasiness. It would have been much more proper and seasonable, on hearing of Christ's being mocked, scourged, spit upon, and crucified, if they had put such a question to themselves, Christ here directs to, <p>are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with? meaning his reproaches, sorrows, sufferings, and death; which because of the disagreeableness of them, he compares to a bitter cup of vengeance, wrath, fury, and indignation; and because they were appointed to him, and allotted for him, they were his portion, therefore he expresses them by a "cup"; and because they were so many and great, of such an overwhelming nature, that he seemed to be plunged into them, and covered with them, therefore he likens them to a "baptism" and which the ordinance of water baptism, performed by immersion, is a lively representation of. Now Christ suggests to these disciples, that instead of indulging their ambitious desires of worldly grandeur, that they would do well to consider what a bitter cup he had to drink of, and what a sea of sorrows and sufferings he was about to be plunged into, and drenched in; and whether they could think of enduring anything of the like kind, for his sake, which was most likely to be in a short time, what they would be called unto, and not to honours, ease, and pleasure; and what they must be sure, more or less, to undergo, before they entered the everlasting kingdom of glory: <p>they say unto him, we are able; not considering the nature of these sufferings, and their own weakness; but partly through ignorance of themselves, and a vain confidence which possessed them; and chiefly through a vehement desire of the places in his kingdom, they asked for, and which they thought drinking his cup, and being baptized with his baptism, were the condition, and the means of enjoying; and so rashly affirm their ability, and which includes their willingness to comply herewith. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.

They indeed merited a rebuke for their preposterous demand; but the Saviour deals mildly with them. They had spoken ignorantly, perhaps fancying that some favour might be shown to them on the ground of their relationship to the Virgin Mary, or because of their nearness to Jesus, and certainly not in the least realizing the nature of the kingdom, the qualifications of its inheritors, or the difficulties that have to be surmounted by those who would win eminent positions therein. Things that we deem most desirable would often be the very worst for our spiritual progress; and in praying for really good things, we are apt to forget to count the cost we must pay for their attainment. Jesus sets before the ambitious brethren the obstacles that would meet them. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye able to drink of the cup?</span> Joy and sorrow, blessing and affliction, in Holy Scripture are often denoted under the metaphor of a cup (comp. <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). Here the cup signifies the internal, mental, and spiritual sufferings which Christ endured (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I shall drink of;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">which I am about to drink</span>; or am purposing to drink. Christ expresses his voluntary intention of suffering bitterly, and asks if they are prepared to do the same. <span class="cmt_word">To he baptized,</span> etc. The baptism is significant of the external pains and persecutions, in the sea of which he was to be sunk (comp. <a href="/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 15</a>). The cup and the baptism adumbrate the two sacraments by which we are made one with Christ. Many of the best manuscripts, the Vulgate and other versions, omit this last clause, and the corresponding one in the following verse; and many modern editors, with the Revised Version, expunge it also. It is supposed to have been introduced from the parallel passage in St. Mark. There it is undoubtedly genuine; so we have good warrant to believe that our Lord spoke the words, whether St. Matthew really reported them or not. <span class="cmt_word">We are able.</span> They came forward now and answered in simplicity, not understanding that to which they pledged themselves. They loved their Master, they knew that trials awaited him, and they were willing to share his lot. Ere long they were put to the proof, and in the end came out victorious.  </body></html>
