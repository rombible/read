There is mercy enough in Christ for all that ask. They were earnest in prayer. They cried out as men in earnest. Cold desires beg denials. They were humble in prayer, casting themselves upon, and referring themselves cheerfully to, the Mediator's mercy. They showed faith in prayer, by the title they gave to Christ. Surely it was by the Holy Ghost that they called Jesus, Lord. They persevered in prayer. When they were in pursuit of such mercy, it was no time for timidity or hesitation: they cried earnestly. Christ encouraged them. The wants and burdens of the body we are soon sensible of, and can readily relate. Oh that we did as feelingly complain of our spiritual maladies, especially our spiritual blindness! Many are spiritually blind, yet say they see. Jesus cured these blind men; and when they had received sight, they followed him. None follow Christ blindly. He first by his grace opens men's eyes, and so draws their hearts after him. These miracles are our call to Jesus; may we hear it, and make it our daily prayer to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the multitude rebuked them because ... - They chid or reproved them, and in a threatening manner told them to be silent.<p>They cried the more - Jesus, standing still, ordered them to be brought to him (Mark)<p>His friends then addressed the blind men and told them that Jesus called (Mark). Mark adds that Bartimeus cast away his garment, and rose and came to Jesus.

That is, that their sight might be restored to them; for being deprived of that, it was all one as if their eyes were so closed, that they could not open them; and so the recovery of it is expressed by an opening of them. The opening of the eyes of the blind was prophesied of, as what should be done in the days of the Messiah, and by him, as an evidence of his being that person, <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a> which prophecy these blind men might be acquainted with, and be an encouragement to their faith to expect a cure from him. They do not ask for alms, but for the recovery of their sight; which being granted, they would be able to get their bread in another way; for they were not like some idle persons that choose rather to be under such a calamity, or any other, that they might not be obliged to work with their hands for a livelihood. Their request shows, that they made no doubt of it, but firmly believed that Christ was able to do this for them, though the thing was impossible to be done by man; who therefore must conclude that he was not a mere man, but the Son of the living God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/20.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/20-33.htm" title="They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.">Matthew 20:33</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα ἀνοιγῶσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] answering the above question in terms of the object aimed at in the cry, <span class="greekheb">ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς</span>, of which <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀνοιγ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is the continuation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἥψατο</span>] different from Mark and Luke, who represent Jesus as healing merely by the power of His <span class="ital">word</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῶν ὀμμάτων</span> (see critical notes), used for variety, being, as far as the meaning is concerned, the same as <span class="greekheb">ὀφθαλμοί</span>.
