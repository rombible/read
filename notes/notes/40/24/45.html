He is to supply men with the spiritual food which they need for the sustenance of their higher life. It may be the “spiritual milk” of <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>; it may be the “strong meat” or “solid food.” There is an art, as it were, of spiritual dietetics, which requires tact and discernment as well as faithfulness. The wise servant will seek to discover not only the right kind of food, but the right season for giving it. An apparent parallel presents itself in the common interpretation of “rightly dividing the word of truth” (<a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2Timothy 2:15</a>), but the imagery implied in that phrase is probably of an entirely different character.

See notes on <a href="/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a>, &c. <span class="ital">Blessed is that servant, </span>&c. — “You, the ministers of religion, ought to be peculiarly faithful in the discharge of your duty; for it is not an ordinary trust that is committed to your charge. You are stewards, whose business it is to take care of the whole family, and who, because of the influence which your example may have upon others, ought to be remarkably diligent. Your duty is to be well acquainted with the stores of evangelical truths, and to understand how they may be best applied. You should know likewise the various characters of the persons under your charge, that you may be able to give every one of them his portion of meat in due season. <span class="ital">Verily, he shall make him ruler over all his goods </span>— If when I come I find you thus employed, I will highly reward you with the glories and joys of my kingdom, even as an earthly master bestows particular marks of respect on such servants as have been remarkably faithful in any important trust.” <span class="ital">But if that evil servant </span>— Now become evil, having <span class="ital">put away faith and a good conscience, shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth, </span>&c. — “On the other hand, if you behave like wicked stewards, who, because their lord delays his coming, beat their fellow-servants and get drunk with sots and epicures; if you tyrannise over the consciences of your brethren, neglect the duties of your function, and give yourselves up to sensual pleasures, I will come when you little think of it, and will make you dreadful examples of my indignation, by the severe punishments which I will inflict upon you.” <span class="ital">And shall cut him asunder </span>— Tearing and cutting persons into several pieces, was one of the severest kinds of punishment anciently used, and is here put for the extreme misery that awaits the persons here described in the other world. <span class="ital">And appoint him his portion with the hypocrites </span>— The worst of sinners. If ministers are the persons here primarily intended, there is a peculiar propriety in the expression. For no hypocrisy can be baser than to call ourselves ministers of Christ while we are the slaves of avarice, ambition, or sensuality. Wherever such are found, may God reform them by his grace, or disarm them of that power and influence which they continually abuse to his dishonour, and to their own aggravated damnation! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is, in fact, "a parable," though it is not expressly so called. The design is to show that his disciples should act as if they were each moment expecting his return.

The Vulgate Latin adds, "do you think?" and is a question put to the disciples, which they might apply to themselves: in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>, it is spoken in answer to a question of Peter's, in relation to the above exhortation, whether it was spoken to them, or to all; and by this answer, it looks as if it was more especially designed for them, though it may be applied to other. The "servant" is there called a "steward", for such a servant is meant; and a name that is very proper for the apostles and ministers of the word, who are stewards of the mysteries of Christ, and of the manifold grace of God; and whose characters are, that they are "faithful": for this is required in stewards, that they be faithful to the trust reposed in them; as ministers are, when they preach the pure Gospel of Christ, and the whole of it; conceal no part, nor keep anything of it; seek not to please men, but God; neither seek their own things, their ease, honour, and profit, but the glory of God, the honour of Christ, and the good of souls; and abide by the truths, cause, and interest of a Redeemer, at all hazards. And they are "wise", who know and are well instructed in divine things; who make Christ the main subject of their ministry; who improve their talents and time for their master's use, and the advantage of those that are under their care; who seek for, and deliver acceptable words and matter; and manage their whole trust, so as to be able to give in a good account of their stewardship another day. The post that such a person is put in, and the work he is to do, follow: <p>whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household; or "family", the church of God, which is the household of God, and of faith, in which are believers of various growths and sizes; some fathers, some young men, some children; and over these, the ministers are, by their Lord, made and placed as rulers; not as lords and tyrants over God's heritage, to govern them in an arbitrary way, but as over them in the Lord, to rule them according to the word of God, and the laws of his house; by preaching the Gospel, administering ordinances, and keeping up his worship and the discipline of the church; and whose principal business it is, <p>to give them meat in due season; even "their portion" of it, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>, for the word of God is to be cut and rightly divided, and everyone in the family, according to his age, appetite, and digestion, is to have his proper part and portion given him: it must be meat, proper food, such as is solid, substantial, and nourishing; even the wholesome words of Christ Jesus, that must be given them, and not husks and empty trash; and all in due season, in its proper time, as their cases and circumstances require, and call for; as whether weary, or uncomfortable, or in the dark, or under temptations and afflictions: for a word fitly and seasonably spoken, how useful is it! <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/24.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/24-45.htm" title="Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?">Matthew 24:45</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Τίς ἄρα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">who therefore</span>, considering the necessity for preparedness thus indicated.

In <a href="/luke/12-41.htm">Luke 12:41</a>, etc, Christ utters this parabolic discourse in reply to Peter's question, "Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?" He now turns his exhortation to those in authority over the house, specially to the ministers and stewards of his mysteries, proposing it in an interrogative form, not only because the man he wants is difficult to find, but in order that each may put the question to himself, and see if he reaches the high standard suggested. <span class="cmt_word">Is a</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faithful and wise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">prudens, practically wise</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>. The idea is that some good and true slave is raised to the stewardship of his master's household, like Eliezer whom Abram advanced to this position (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath made ruler</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">hath set</span>) <span class="cmt_word">over his household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, see on ver. 47). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is used classically for a body of attendants, the servants that form the family, the <span class="accented">menage.</span> Christ asks - Where is one to be found fit for this position in his Church? It is the Lord who selects and appoints the  steward; he is neither self-constituted nor appointed by those over whom he rules. <span class="cmt_word">To give</span> <span class="cmt_word">them meat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">their food</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in due season.</span> It was the duty of such an officer to dispense the regular allowance of daily food to the members of the household. So the stewards of the mysteries of Christ have to feed his flock with spiritual food, with the Word and sacraments, and. to do this wisely and discreetly, according to the capacity, advancement, and circumstances of each recipient. The exhortation holds good for others as well as the clergy, civil rulers, the rich, all men. All our endowments, mental, spiritual, physical, material, are the gift of God, and are to be used in his service and to the good of others. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In due season (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>At the regular hours which his Lord observes when at home; and not delaying because he thinks that his Lord delayeth his coming (<a href="/matthew/24-48.htm">Matthew 24:48</a>), but doing his duty in its appointed time. </body></html>
