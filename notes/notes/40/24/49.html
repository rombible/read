We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Smite his fellow-servants ... - This is the conduct of a wicked servant, who, supposing he would not be called to account, and abusing his authority, gave himself up to oppression, carousing, and debauchery.<p>It is designed to represent the conduct of ministers who are unfaithful and overbearing, and who abuse their trust in the church.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Mt 24:1-51.

By abusing the power lodged in him, usurping a dominion over their faith, and imposing on their consciences things which Christ has never commanded; vexing and burdening them with trifling rites and ceremonies, and other unnecessary things; wounding, grieving, offending weak minds by his conduct and example; or persecuting the saints, such of them as cannot come into everything in his way of believing and practising: <p>and to eat and drink with the drunken; giving himself up to luxury and intemperance; feeding himself instead of the family; serving his own belly, and not his Lord and Master Christ; living an ungodly and licentious life, altogether unbecoming the Gospel of Christ: such servants and stewards have been, and are in the church of God; but sad will be their case, when their Lord comes, as follows. Respect seems to be had either to the ecclesiastical rulers among the Jews, who went under the name of the servants of the Lord, but persecuted the apostles, and those that believed in Christ; or the "Judaizing" Christians, and false teachers, that were for imposing the ceremonies of the law upon believers; or Simon Magus, and his followers, a set of licentious, men; or all of them; who lived in this period of time, between the death of Christ, and the destruction of the temple. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/24-49.htm" title="And shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;">Matthew 24:49</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνδούλους</span>, <span class="ital">fellow-servants</span>) They are called <span class="ital">fellow-servants</span>, to bring out in strong relief the injurious character of that <span class="ital">evil servant’s</span> conduct towards them: they were, however, subject to him, though he with them was subject to their common Lord.—<span class="greekheb">δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>) His injurious conduct towards his fellow-servants, and his own self-indulgence, are put in strong contrast with each other.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ τῶν μεθυόντων</span>, <span class="ital">with the drunken</span>) There will, therefore, at that time be many whose whole condition and character will consist in vicious self-indulgence.
