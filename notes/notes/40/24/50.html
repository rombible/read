We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Smite his fellow-servants ... - This is the conduct of a wicked servant, who, supposing he would not be called to account, and abusing his authority, gave himself up to oppression, carousing, and debauchery.<p>It is designed to represent the conduct of ministers who are unfaithful and overbearing, and who abuse their trust in the church.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Mt 24:1-51.
