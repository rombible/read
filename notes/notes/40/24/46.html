Christian insight has, however, rightly given them a wider application. As there are “days of the Lord” in the history of churches and nations, so the Lord comes to men in the crises of their individual lives; and one such coming is that day of death which closes the trial-time of their earthly life, and brings them into the presence of the Judge.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is, in fact, "a parable," though it is not expressly so called. The design is to show that his disciples should act as if they were each moment expecting his return. This he illustrates by the conduct of a servant who did not expect his master soon to return, who acted with great impropriety, and who was accordingly punished.<p><a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a><p>Who, then, is a faithful and wise servant ... - By the conduct of a faithful and wise servant Jesus intends to denote a faithful Christian, a servant of God, or a teacher of religion.<p>Whom his lord - His master.<p>The word here has no reference to God. It means the "lord" or master of the servant. Applied to Christian teachers, in the spiritual meaning of the parable, it refers to "Christ," who has appointed them as teachers, and who is their Lord and Master, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13-14</a>.<p>Over his household - His family. Christian ministers are the servants of God appointed over the church, the family of Christ, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>.<p>Meat in due season - The word "meat" here means food of all kinds. When the Bible was translated into English, the word included, as the original does, all kinds of provisions requisite to support and nourish life.<p>In due season - As they need it, or in the accustomed times. This was the office of a steward. Among the ancients this office was often filled by a "slave" - one who had shown himself trusty and faithful. The duty was to have a general superintendence over the affairs of the family. Applied to Christian ministers, it means that they are to feed the flock of God, to "minister" to their needs, and to do it as they need it, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Mt 24:1-51.
