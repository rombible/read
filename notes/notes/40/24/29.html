No other meaning could have been found in the words when they were first heard or read. The “days” of this verse are those which were shortened “for the elect’s sake” (<a href="/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>). The “tribulation” can be none other than that of <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.">Matthew 24:21</a>, which was emphatically connected with the flight of men from the beleaguered city. The language of St. Mark, “in those days, after that tribulation,” followed by a description of the second Advent identical in substance with St. Matthew’s, brings the two events, if possible, into yet closer juxtaposition. How are we to explain the fact that already more than eighteen centuries have rolled away, and “the promise of His coming” still tarries? It is a partial answer to the question to say that God’s measurements of time are not as man’s, and that with Him “a thousand years are as one day” (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>); that there is that in God which answers to the modification of a purpose in man, and now postpones, now hastens, the unfolding of His plan. But that which may seem the boldest answer is also (in the judgment of the present writer) that which seems the truest and most reverential. Of that “day and hour” knew no man, “not even the Son” (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>), “but the Father only” (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>); and therefore He, as truly man, and as having, therefore, vouchsafed to accept the limitations of knowledge incident to man’s nature, speaks of the two events as poets and prophets speak of the far-off future. As men gazing from a distance see the glittering heights of two snow crowned mountains apparently in close proximity, and take no account of the vast tract, it may be of very many miles, which lies between them; so it was that those whose thoughts must have been mainly moulded on this prediction, the Apostles and their immediate disciples, though they were too conscious of their ignorance Of “the times and the seasons” to fix the day or year, lived and died in the expectation that it was not far off, and that they might, by prayer and acts, hasten its coming (<a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a>). (See Note on <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Shall the sun be darkened.</span>—The words reproduce the imagery in which Isaiah had described the day of the Lord’s judgment upon Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>), and may naturally receive the same symbolic interpretation. Our Lord speaks here in language as essentially apocalyptic as that of the Revelation of St. John (<a href="/revelation/8-12.htm" title="And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.">Revelation 8:12</a>), and it lies in the very nature of such language that it precludes a literal interpretation. Even the common speech of men describes a time of tribulation as one in which “the skies are dark” and “the sun of a nation’s glory sets in gloom;” and the language of Isaiah, of St. John, and of our Lord, is but the expansion of that familiar parable. Sun, moon, and stars <span class= "ital">may</span> represent, as many have thought, kingly power, and the spiritual influence of which the Church of Christ is the embodiment, and the illuminating power of those who “shine as lights in the world” (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Philippians 2:15</a>), but even this interpretation is, it may be, over-precise and technical, and the words are better left in their dim and terrible vagueness.<p><span class= "bld">The powers of the heavens.</span>—These are, it will be noted, distinguished from the “stars,” and may be taken as the apocalyptic expression for the laws or “forces” by which moon and stars are kept in their appointed courses. The phrase is found elsewhere only in the parallel passages in St. Mark and St. Luke.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Immediately after, </span>&c. — We are now come to the last act of this dismal tragedy, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the final dissolution of the Jewish polity in church and state, which our Lord, for several reasons, might not think fit to declare nakedly and plainly, and therefore chose to clothe his discourse in figurative language. Commentators, indeed, have generally understood this, and what follows, of the end of the world, and of Christ’s coming to judgment: but the words, <span class="ital">immediately</span> <span class="ital">after the tribulation of those days, </span>show evidently that he is not speaking of any distant event, but of something immediately consequent upon the tribulation before mentioned, and that must be the destruction of the temple and city of Jerusalem, and the abolition of the Jewish polity, civil and religious. It is true, his figures are very strong, but not stronger than those used by the ancient prophets upon similar occasions. The Prophet Isaiah speaks in the same manner of the destruction of Babylon, <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>, <span class="ital">The stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. </span>The Prophet Ezekiel describes in similar terms the destruction coming on Egypt, <a href="/context/ezekiel/32-7.htm" title="And when I shall put you out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light....">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>. <span class="ital">When I shall put thee out I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. </span>The Prophet Daniel also uses similar language, when speaking of the slaughter of the Jews by <span class="ital">the little horn, </span>meaning probably Antiochus Epiphanes: <span class="ital">And it waxed great even unto the host of heaven; and cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. </span>And lastly, God, by Joel, foretelling this very same destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="/context/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke....">Joel 2:30-31</a>, says, <span class="ital">I will show wonders in heaven and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood. </span>So that great commotions and revolutions upon earth are often represented by commotions and changes in the heavens.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:29-41 Christ foretells his second coming. It is usual for prophets to speak of things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness and certainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretold that there shall be a great change, in order to the making all things new. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At his first coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shall shortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they have pierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endless horror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there are some in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shall keep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should never cease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predicting were fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment; therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease to exist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men of the world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but they plan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and most certain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away every human scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will be as surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first, to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment. Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. They were secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and they believed not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortly pass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it far from them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of our Saviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, and suddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their house employments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside, and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I prepared to meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day of judgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Immediately after the tribulation of those days - That is, immediately after these tribulations, events will occur that "may be properly represented" by the darkening of the sun and moon, and by the stars falling from heaven. The word rendered "immediately" - &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  eutheo&#772;s - means, properly, "straightway, immediately," <a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-5.htm">Matthew 13:5</a>; <a href="/mark/1-31.htm">Mark 1:31</a>; <a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a>; then "shortly," <a href="/3_john/1-14.htm">3 John 1:14</a>. This is the meaning here. Such events would "shortly" or "soon" occur In the fulfillment of the predictions they would be "the next in order," and would occur "before long." The term here requires us to admit that, in order to the fulfillment of the prophecy, it can be shown, or it actually happened, that things "did" soon occur "after the tribulation of those days" which would be "properly represented or described" by the images which the Saviour employs. It is not necessary to show that there could not have been "a more remote" reference to events lying far in the future, in which there would be a more complete fulfillment or "filling up" of the meaning of the words (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22-23</a>); but it is necessary that there should have been events which would be "properly expressed" by the language which the Saviour uses, or which would have been in some proper sense "fulfilled," even if there had not been reference to more remote events. It will be seen in the exposition that this was actually the case, and that therefore there was a propriety in saying that these events would occur "immediately" - that is, "soon, or the next in order." Compare the notes at <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>.<p>Shall the sun be darkened ... - The images used here are not to be taken literally. They are often employed by the sacred writers to denote "any great calamities." As the darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars, would be an inexpressible calamity, so any great catastrophe - any overturning of kingdoms or cities, or dethroning of kings and princes is represented by the darkening of the sun and moon, and by some terrible convulsion in the elements. Thus the destruction of Babylon is foretold in similar terms <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, and of Tyre <a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>. The slaughter in Bozrah and Idumea is predicted in the same language, <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. See also <a href="/isaiah/50-3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>. To the description in Matthew, Luke has added <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25-26</a>, "And upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; people's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." All these are figures of great and terrible calamities. The roaring of the waves of the sea denotes great tumult and affliction among the people. "Perplexity" means doubt, anxiety; not knowing what to do to escape. "Men's hearts should fail them for fear," or by reason of fear. Their fears would be so great as to take away their courage and strength. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Mt 24:1-51.

Concerning the destruction of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Those who interpret it of the destruction of Jerusalem have the context to guide them, as also the reports of historians, of strange prodigies seen in the air and earth, before the taking of it; likewise the word <span class="ital">immediately after, </span>& c. But I am more inclinable to interpret them of the last judgment, and to think that our Saviour is now passed to satisfy the disciples about their other question, concerning the end of the world; for although Christ’s coming may sometimes signify that remarkable act of his providence in the destruction of his enemies, yet the next verses speaking of his coming with great power and glory, and of his coming with his angels, and with the sound of a trumpet, and gathering his elect from the four winds, the phrases are so like the phrases by which the Scripture expresses Christ’s coming to the last judgment, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a> <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a></span>, and Christ speaking to his disciples asking of him as well about that as the destruction of Jerusalem, I should rather interpret this verse with reference to the last judgment, than the destruction of Jerusalem before spoken of, or at least that these signs should be understood common both to the one and the other, as divers of the other signs mentioned in this chapter are. Some think that the darkening of the sun and the moon here, the falling of the stars, and the shaking of the powers of heaven, are to be taken metaphorically, as signifying the great change there should be in the ecclesiastical and civil state of the Jews; and it is true that such kind of expressions do often in Scripture so signify, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a> 24:23 <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm" title="And when I shall put you out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.">Ezekiel 32:7</a> <a href="/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a></span>. But without doubt the literal sense is not to be excluded, whether we understand the text of the destruction of Jerusalem, or of his coming to his last judgment; for as historians tell of great prodigies seen before the former, so the apostle confirms us that there will be such things seen before the day of judgment, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>,12</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Immediately after the tribulation of those days,.... That is, immediately after the distress the Jews would be in through the siege of Jerusalem, and the calamities attending it; just upon the destruction of that city, and the temple in it, with the whole nation of the Jews, shall the following things come to pass; and therefore cannot be referred to the last judgment, or what should befall the church, or world, a little before that time, or should be accomplished in the whole intermediate time, between the destruction of Jerusalem, and the last judgment: for all that is said to account for such a sense, as that it was usual with the prophets to speak of judgments afar off as near; and that the apostles often speak of the coming of Christ, the last judgment, and the end of the world, as just at hand; and that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, will not answer to the word "immediately", or show that that should be understood of two thousand years after: besides, all the following things were to be fulfilled before that present generation, in which Christ lived, passed away, <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a> and therefore must be understood of things that should directly, and immediately take place upon, or at the destruction of the city and temple, <p>Shall the sun be darkened: not in a literal but in a figurative sense; and is to be understood not of the religion of the Jewish church; nor of the knowledge of the law among them, and the decrease of it; nor of the Gospel being obscured by heretics and false teachers; nor of the temple of Jerusalem, senses which are given into by one or another; but of the Shekinah, or the divine presence in the temple. The glory of God, who is a sun and a shield, filled the tabernacle, when it was reared up; and so it did the temple, when it was built and dedicated; in the most holy place, Jehovah took up his residence; here was the symbol of his presence, the mercy seat, and the two cherubim over it: and though God had for some time departed from this people, and a voice was heard in the temple before its destruction, saying, "let us go hence"; yet the token of the divine presence remained till the utter destruction of it; and then this sun was wholly darkened, and there was not so much as the outward symbol of it: <p>and the moon shall not give her light; which also is to be explained in a figurative and metaphorical sense; and refers not to the Roman empire, which quickly began to diminish; nor to the city of Jerusalem; nor to the civil polity of the nation; but to the ceremonial law, the moon, the church is said to have under her feet, <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a> so called because the observance of new moons was one part of it, and the Jewish festivals were regulated by the moon; and especially, because like the moon, it was variable and changeable. Now, though this, in right, was abolished at the death of Christ, and ceased to give any true light, when he, the substance, was come; yet was kept up by the Jews, as long as their temple was standing; but when that was destroyed, the daily sacrifice, in fact, ceased, and so it has ever since; the Jews esteeming it unlawful to offer sacrifice in a strange land, or upon any other altar than that of Jerusalem; and are to this day without a sacrifice, and without an ephod: <p>and the stars shall fall from heaven; which phrase, as it elsewhere intends the doctors of the church, and preachers falling off from purity of doctrine and conversation; so here it designs the Jewish Rabbins and doctors, who departed from the word of God, and set up their traditions above it, fell into vain and senseless interpretations of it, and into debates about things contained in their Talmud; the foundation of which began to be laid immediately upon their dispersion into other countries: <p>and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; meaning all the ordinances of the legal dispensation; which shaking, and even removing of them, were foretold by <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a> and explained by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26</a> whereby room and way were made for Gospel ordinances to take place, and be established; which shall not be shaken, so as to be removed, but remain till the second coming of Christ. The Jews themselves are sensible, and make heavy complaints of the great declensions and alterations among them, since the destruction of the temple; for after having taken notice of the death of several of their doctors, who died a little before, or after that; and that upon their death ceased the honour of the law, the splendour of wisdom, and the glory of the priesthood, they add (g), <p>"from the time that the temple was destroyed, the wise men, and sons of nobles, were put to shame, and they covered their heads; liberal men were reduced to poverty; and men of violence and calumny prevailed; and there were none that expounded, or inquired, or asked. R. Elezer the great, said, from the time the sanctuary were destroyed, the wise men began to be like Scribes, and the Scribes like to the Chazans, (or sextons that looked after the synagogues,) and the Chazans like to the common people, and the common people grew worse and worse, and there were none that inquired and asked; <p>that is, of the wise men there were no scholars, or very few that studied in the law, <p>(g) Misn.

Ebrard’s explanation of this passage falls to the ground with his erroneous interpretation of <a href="/context/matthew/24-23.htm" title="Then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ, or there; believe it not....">Matthew 24:23-24</a>, that explanation being as follows: <span class="ital">immediately after the unhappy condition of the church</span> (<a href="/context/matthew/24-23.htm" title="Then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ, or there; believe it not....">Matthew 24:23-28</a>), <span class="ital">a condition which is to continue after the destruction of Jerusalem</span>,—it being assumed that the <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> involves the meaning: “<span class="ital">nullis aliis intercedentibus indiciis</span>.” It may be observed generally, that a whole host of strange and fanciful interpretations have been given here, in consequence of its having been assumed that Jesus could not possibly have intended to say that His second advent was to follow immediately upon the destruction of Jerusalem. This assumption, however, is contrary to all exegetical rule, considering that Jesus repeatedly makes reference elsewhere (see also <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>) to His second coming as an event that is near at hand. Among those interpretations may also be classed that of Schott (following such earlier expositors as Hammond and others, who had already taken <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">suddenly</span>), who says that Matthew had written <span class="greekheb">פִּתְאֹם</span>, subito, but that the translator (like the Sept. in the case of <a href="/job/5-3.htm" title="I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.">Job 5:3</a>) had rendered the expression “minus accurate” by <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>. This is certainly a wonderful supposition, for the simple reason that the <span class="greekheb">פתאם</span> itself would be a wonderful expression to use if an interval of a thousand years was to intervene. Bengel has contributed to promote this view by his observation that: “Nondum erat tempus revelandi totam seriem rerum futurarum a vastatione Hieros. usque ad consummationem seculi,” and by his paraphrase of the passage: “De iis, quae post pressuram dierum illorum, delendae urbis Jerusalem, evenient proximum, quod in praesenti pro mea conditione commemorandum et pro vestra capacitate expectandum venit, hoc est, quod sol obscurabitur,” etc. Many others, as Wetstein, for example, have been enabled to dispense with gratuitous assumptions of this sort by understanding <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a> ff. to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, which is supposed to be described therein in the language of prophetic imagery (Kuinoel), and they so understand the verse in spite of the destruction already introduced at <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>. In this, however, they escape Scylla only to be drawn into Charybdis, and are compelled to have recourse to expedients of a still more hazardous kind in order to explain away the literal advent,[18] which is depicted in language as clear as it is sublime. And yet E. J. Meyer again interprets <a href="/context/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:...">Matthew 24:29-34</a> of the destruction of Jerusalem, and in such a way as to make it appear that the prediction regarding the final advent is not introduced till <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>. But this view is at once precluded by the fact that in <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a> <span class="greekheb">ὁ οὐρανὸς κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ γῆ παρελεύσεται</span> cannot be regarded as the leading idea, the theme of what follows, but only as a subsidiary thought (v. 18) by way of background for the words <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ λόγοι μου οὐ μὴ παρέλθ</span>. immediately after (observe, Christ does not say <span class="greekheb">οἱ γὰρ λόγοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ λόγοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). Hoelemann, Cremer, Auberlen are right in their interpretation of <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>, but wrong in regarding <span class="ital">the time of the culmination of the heathen power</span>—an idea imported from <a href="/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>—as antecedent to the period indicated by <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>.

According to Dorner, our passage is intended as a prophetical delineation of the <span class="ital">fall of heathenism</span>, which would follow immediately upon the overthrow of Judaism; and, accordingly, he sees in the mention of the sun, moon, and stars an allusion to the <span class="ital">nature-worship</span> of the heathen world, an idea, however, which is refuted at once by <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>; see E. J. Meyer, p. 125 ff.; Bleek, p. 356; Hofmann, p. 636; Gess, p. 136. Ewald correctly interprets: “While the whole world is being convulsed (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>, after <a href="/joel/3-3.htm" title="And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.">Joel 3:3</a> f.; <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>), the heaven-sent Messiah appears in His glory (according to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>) to judge,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀστέρες πεσοῦνται</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Comp. <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>. To be understood <span class="ital">literally</span>, but not as illustrative of sad times (Hengstenberg on the Revelation; Gerlach, <span class="ital">letzte Dinge</span>, p. 102); and yet not in the sense of <span class="ital">falling-stars</span> (Fritzsche, Kuinoel), but as meaning: the <span class="ital">whole</span> of the stars together. Similarly in the passage in Isaiah just referred to, in accordance with the ancient idea that heaven was a firmament in which the stars were set for the purpose of giving light to the earth (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14</a>). The <span class="ital">falling</span> of the stars (which is not to be diluted, with Bengel, Paulus, Schott, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Cremer, following the Greek Fathers, so as to mean a mere <span class="ital">obscuration</span>) to the earth—which, in accordance with the cosmical views of the time, is the plain and natural sense of <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν γῆν</span> (see <a href="/revelation/6-13.htm" title="And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.">Revelation 6:13</a>)—is, no doubt, impossible as an actual fact, but it need not surprise us to see such an idea introduced into a prophetic picture so grandly poetical as this is,—a picture which it is scarcely fair to measure by the astronomical conceptions of our own day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἱ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν σαλευθ</span>.] is usually explained of the <span class="ital">starry hosts</span> (<a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2 Kings 17:16</a>, etc.), which, coming as it does after <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀστέρες πεσοῦνται</span>, would introduce a tautological feature into the picture. The words should therefore be taken in a <span class="ital">general</span> sense: <span class="ital">the powers of the heavens</span> (the powers which uphold the heavens, which stretch them out, and produce the phenomena which take place in them, etc.) <span class="ital">will be so shaken</span> as to lose their usual stability. Comp. <a href="/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>. The interpretation of Olshausen, who follows Jerome, Chrysostom, Euthymius Zigabenus, in supposing that the trembling <span class="ital">in the world of angels</span> is referred to (<a href="/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a>), is inconsistent not merely with <span class="greekheb">σαλευθής</span>., but also with the whole connection which refers to the domain of <span class="ital">physical</span> things.

At this point the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span>, which, according to the evangelist, was one of the subjects on which the disciples desired information, becomes the theme of discourse. What is said thereon is so perplexing as to tempt a modern expositor to wish it had not been there, or to have recourse to critical expedients to eliminate it from the text. But nothing would be gained by that unless we got rid, at the same time, of other sayings of kindred character ascribed to Jesus in the Gospels. And there seems to be no reason to doubt that some such utterance would form a part of the eschatological discourse, even if the disciples did not ask instruction on the subject. The revelation as to the last days of Israel naturally led up to it, and the best clue to the meaning of the <span class="ital">Parusia-logion</span> may be to regard it as a pendant to that revelation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">Immediately after the tribulation of those days</span>] i. e. the tribulation which shall precede the second advent of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light</span>] Such figurative language is frequent with the Hebrew prophets; it implies (1) the perplexity and confusion of a sudden revolution, a great change; the very sources of light become darkness. Cp. <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>, “For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine;” and (2) the darkness of distress as <a href="/context/ezekiel/32-7.htm" title="And when I shall put you out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light....">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>, “All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐθέως δὲ μετὰ τὴν θλίψιν τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκείνων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">but immediately after the affliction of those days, etc</span>.) There are four things to be observed in this passage. (1) Our Lord speaks of the sun being literally darkened, etc. And this phrase frequently occurs in the prophets, concerning the destruction of a nation, and in such cases has a much more literal force than is generally supposed, for where there is a great destruction of men, the beholders of the sun are reduced to a small number; but much more in the present passage has it a literal force, for the whole of our Lord’s language on this occasion is strictly literal; therefore this verse must be also understood literally. (2) The tribulation indicated will be that of the Jewish people, and that for one generation, (3) It is not said, <span class="ital">after that tribulation</span>, nor <span class="ital">after those days</span>, but <span class="ital">after the tribulation of those days</span>, as in <a href="/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,">Mark 13:24</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις μετὰ τὴν θλίψιν ἐκείνην</span>, <span class="ital">in those days, after that tribulation</span>. The term, “<span class="ital">those days</span>,” refers to <a href="/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-19.htm" title="And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Matthew 24:19</a>; and it is indicated that the tribulation will not be long, but brief in duration; <a href="/context/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be....">Matthew 24:21-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>. (4) The expression, <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>, <span class="ital">quickly</span> (<span class="ital">cito</span>), implies a very short delay, since <span class="greekheb">οὔπω</span>, <span class="ital">not yet</span> (<a href="/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6</a>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ εὐθέως</span>, <span class="ital">not quickly</span> (<a href="/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>), is said of the short delay which must precede that tribulation; nay, the passage already cited from St Mark excludes delay altogether. The Engl. Vers. has “<span class="ital">immediately</span>.” You will say, it is a great leap from the destruction of Jerusalem to the end of the world, which is represented as coming <span class="ital">quickly</span> after it. I reply—A prophecy resembles a landscape painting, which marks distinctly the houses, paths, and bridges in the foreground, but brings together, into a narrow space, the distant valleys and mountains, though they are really far apart. Thus should they who study a prophecy look on the future to which the prophecy refers. And the eyes of the disciples, who had combined in their question the end of the temple and of the world, are left somewhat veiled (for it was not yet the time for knowing; see <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>), from which cause, imitating our Lord’s language, they with universal consent declared that the end was near at hand. In their progress, however, both prophecy and contemplation (<span class="ital">prospectus</span>)[1051] more and more explain things further distant. In which manner also we ought to interpret what is obscure by what is clear, not what is clear by what is obscure, and to venerate in its dark sayings that Divine wisdom which always sees all things, but does not reveal all things at once. Afterwards it was revealed that Antichrist should come before the end of the world; and again Paul joined these two rather nearly together, until the Apocalypse also placed an interval of a thousand years between them. The advent of our Lord, however, actually took place (as far as its commencement was concerned; see Gnomon on <a href="/john/21-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.">John 21:22</a>) after the destruction of Jerusalem, and presently, too, inasmuch as no intermediate event was to be mentioned in the present passage; cf. Gnomon on ch. <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>. The particle <span class="greekheb">ἑυθεως</span> (<span class="ital">quickly</span> or <span class="ital">immediately</span>) refers to this advent, not absolutely to the darkening of the sun and moon, for that accords with the extent of our Lord’s meaning; so that the meaning is “<span class="ital">soon after the tribulation of those days</span>, it will come to pass that the <span class="ital">sun shall be darkened</span>,” etc. A similar connection of an adverb[1052] with a verb occurs in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm" title="But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.">Genesis 2:17</a>; <span class="ital">in the day on which thou shalt eat thereof</span>, it will come to pass that <span class="ital">thou shalt die the death</span>; see also Gnomon on ch. <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>, and <a href="/luke/1-48.htm" title="For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.">Luke 1:48</a>. The expression may also be referred to the mode of speech, so as to mean <span class="ital">after that affliction</span> (which the plan of this discourse, and the point of view from which this time is regarded, permit to be subjoined <span class="ital">immediately</span>, provided it be indicated that the other things will intervene) <span class="ital">the sun shall be darkened</span>, etc. It frequently occurs that adverbs, as in this passage, <span class="greekheb">εὐθεώς</span>, <span class="ital">immediately</span>, do not qualify the thing itself, but the language in which it is expressed. Thus, in <a href="/mark/7-9.htm" title="And he said to them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.">Mark 7:9</a>, the adverb <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΛῶς</span>, <span class="ital">well</span>, and the verb <span class="greekheb">ἀθετεῖτε</span>, <span class="ital">ye abolish</span> [Engl. Vers., <span class="ital">ye reject</span>], are joined with [a part of] the verb <span class="ital">to say</span> [viz. <span class="ital">it may be said that</span>], understood: thus, too, in <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, the adverb <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>, <span class="ital">again</span>, is joined with the verb <span class="greekheb">ΛΈΓΕΙ</span>, <span class="ital">He saith</span>. In fine, St Luke (<a href="/context/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled....">Luke 21:24-25</a>) separates the <span class="ital">signs</span> in the sun, etc. [from <span class="ital">that tribulation</span>] by a greater interval. Some explain <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> as denoting, not the shortness of the interval, but the suddenness of the event after long intervening periods. We must, however, keep to our first interpretation, so indeed that the particle <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> be understood to comprehend the whole space between the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and the end of the world. On such passages there rests, as St Antony used to term it, a <span class="ital">prophetical cloudlet</span>. It was not yet the fit time for revealing the whole series of events from the destruction of Jerusalem down to the end of the world. The following is a paraphrase of our Lord’s words, “Concerning those things which will happen <span class="ital">after the tribulation of those days</span> of the destruction of Jerusalem, THE NEAREST EVENT which at present it suits My condition to mention, and your capacity to expect, is this, <span class="ital">that the sun will be darkened</span>,” etc. Furthermore, it does not follow from this that the expression, <span class="greekheb">ΜΕΤᾺ ΤΑῦΤΑ</span>, <span class="ital">after these things</span>, should be understood loosely in <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a>. Where quickness is presupposed from <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>. Such formulæ are to be understood according to the analogy of the passages where they occur.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἥλιος σκοτισθήσεται</span>, <span class="ital">the sun shall be darkened</span>) This must be taken literally, of a calamity different from those which have been described before. In the Old Testament, such expressions are used metaphorically, the figure being derived from that which will literally happen at the end of the world.—<span class="greekheb">Ἡ ΣΕΛΉΝΗ Οὐ ΔΏΣΕΙ ΤῸ ΦΈΓΓΟς ΑὐΤῆς</span>, <span class="ital">the moon shall not give her light</span>) sc. as she is wont to do both when filling and waning. According to the course of nature, the sun and moon are eclipsed at different times: then, however, they will both be eclipsed at once.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐπανοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">from heaven</span>) It is not said <span class="ital">upon the earth</span>; cf. in <a href="/mark/13-25.htm" title="And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.">Mark 13:25</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκπίπτοντες</span>, <span class="ital">falling out</span>. They shall be as though they were not, sc. without light.—<span class="greekheb">ΔΥΝΆΜΕΙς</span>, <span class="ital">powers</span>) sc. those firm interchained and subtle powers of heaven[1053] (distinct from the <span class="ital">stars</span>) which are accustomed to influence the earth. They are thus denominated by Matthew, Mark, and Luke.—<span class="greekheb">σαλευθήσονται</span>, <span class="ital">shall be shaken</span>) an appropriate metaphor from the waves of the sea.[1054]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1051] <span class="ital">Looking further forward</span>, as in the landscape already alluded to, wherein at first sight all the parts might seem projected into the one plane. But the eye, which has gradually come to discern perspective, and to substitute, by the judgment, causes for the visible effects, learns to <span class="ital">look further</span>, and to separate by wide distances the foreground and background of the picture.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1052] Sc. בְּיו̇ם on the day that.—(I.

The Lord proceeds to announce some details of the final advent. Taking the tribulation to be the single fact of the  ruin of Jerusalem, with its accompanying horrors, some have explained the Lord's word "immediately after" by the foreshortening process of prophecy, which makes the distant future seem close to the obtruding present, or by the consideration that in God's view time does not exist: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). But the truth is, the tribulation (ver. 21) only began with the fall of Jerusalem; that was its first and partial fulfilment; and, am St. Luke implies (<a href="/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23, 24</a>), it has been going on ever since, and is not yet finished. The punishment of the Jews is still proceeding, Jerusalem is still trodden down by the Gentiles, wrath still lies upon the people, they are still dispersed over the world, and have been and are more or leas persecuted in many countries. This state of things is to continue "till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled;" it is, then, "immediately after" this that the signs announced by the Lord shall be seen. He is, as we said above (see on ver. 4), purposely indefinite, that the Church may learn to wait and watch for the return of the Saviour and Judge. This state of expectatation is to be its normal condition. It had its effect on the primitive Church before she Jewish catastrophe. St. Peter (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19-21</a>) tells of the times of refreshing, when Jesus shall come, as possibly close at hand; St. Paul more than once speaks in the same strain (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, etc.), though he warns his converts not to omit ordinary duties in immediate expectation of the end (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>); St. James (James 5:9) tells of the Judge standing before the door. And since then often has this belief cropped up at various stages of the world's history, showing that Christ's warning has sunk deep into Christian hearts, and produced the temper of mind which he purposed to raise. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the sun be darkened,</span> etc. There is no valid reason why the physical phenomena mentioned in this verso are not to be taken literally, even if we see also in them a spiritual significance. It is only reasonable to expect that the end of this world should be accompanied by stupendous changes in the realm of nature. The sun was miraculously darkened when Jesus hung on the cross. What wonder if similar catastrophes signal his coming to judgment? The apostle's words point to a literal fulfilment (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>). Our Lord's prediction echoes announcements often found in the Old Testament, which are not always to be considered metaphorical (see <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30, 31</a>; <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15, 16</a>; <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). Anticipations of some of these terrible latter day signs occurred at Jerusalem, according to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:05.3,4). <span class="cmt_word">Darkened... not give light.</span> This is in accordance with Hebrew parallelism. The next clause is constructed in the same way. <span class="cmt_word">Fall from heaven.</span> The Lord may be speaking of the apparent effect of these convulsions of nature, in accordance with popular ideas, as we talk of the sun rising and setting; or he may thus term the obscuration or extinction of the light of the stars. <span class="cmt_word">The powers of the heavens</span> mean probably the heavenly bodies independent of the solar system, called elsewhere "the host of heaven" (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>. etc.); or the phrase may signify (though the parallelism would not be so perfect) the forces and laws which control these bodies. An interruption in the action of these powers would occasion the most awful catastrophes (see Haggai 3:6, which makes a similar announcement). We must notice the spiritual application of this prediction, as it has obtained a wide acceptance. The words are sometimes taken in a bad sense. The sun is Satan, or Lucifer, who fell as lightning from heaven (<a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>); "the powers of the heavens" are the hosts of the prince of the power of the air, "the spiritual wickednesses in high places;" the stars are all that exalt themselves, who shall be consumed and vanish at the brightness of the cross. But more generally the luminaries are explained in a good sense. The sun is Christ or his truth, which shall be obscured in the last days; the moon is the Church, darkened by heresy and unbelief, and borrowing no light from its sun; the stars are they who once were foremost in the faith, but now shall fall from their steadfastness, or be unable to diffuse light, owing to the gross darkness and mistiness of those evil days. </body></html>
