Do not assume any new appearance, or change your visage or dress. The Jews and all neighboring nations were much in the habit of washing and anointing their bodies. This washing was performed at every meal; and where it could be effected, the head, or other parts of the body, was daily anointed with sweet or olive oil. In a warm climate, exposed to the great heat of the sun, this practice conduced much to health, preserved the skin smooth and tender, and afforded a most grateful sensation and odor.

Christ allows of fasting, but what is of a quite different kind from that of the Jews; which lay not in an outward abstinence from food, and other conveniences of life, and refreshments of nature; but in an abstinence from sin, in acknowledgment and confession of it; and in the exercise of faith and hope in God, as a God pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin; wherefore cheerfulness, and a free use of the creatures, without an abuse of them, best became such persons. <p>Anoint thine head, and wash thy face; directly contrary to the Jewish canons, which forbid these things, with others, on fast days: <p>"On the day of atonement, (say (i) they,) a man is forbidden eating and drinking, "and washing and anointing", and putting on of shoes, and the use of the bed.'' <p>And the same were forbidden on other fasts: in anointings, the head was anointed first, and this rule and reason are given for it: <p>"he that would anoint his whole body,  , "let him anoint his head first", because it is king over all its members (k).'' <p>Anointing and washing were signs of cheerfulness and joy; see <a href="/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>. <p>(i) Misn.

Comp. Chrysostom. The form is one that is suited to an attitude of radical opposition to Jewish formalism. Luther: “If thou so fastest between thyself and thy Father alone, thou hast rightly fasted in that it pleases Him; yet not as if one must not go on a fast-day with few clothes, or unwashed, but the additional ceremony is rejected, because it is observed for the sake of applause, and to hoodwink people with such singular demeanour.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄλειψαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">νίψαι</span>: not necessarily as if preparing for a feast (Meyer and Weiss), but performing the usual daily ablutions for comfort and cleanliness, so avoiding parade of fasting by neglect of them (Bleek, Achelis).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The foregoing inculcations of sincerity and reality in religion contribute indirectly to the illustration of the divine name Father, which is here again defined by discriminating use.

But as anointing, at least, cannot be proved to have been a daily habit (though expressly forbidden during the stricter kinds of fasts, see Schurer, II. 2:212), especially with the mixed classes whom our Lord was addressing, and as it was with the ancients rather a symbol of special joy, it is safer to take it in this sense here. Thus our Lord will mean - so far from appearing sad, let your appearance be that of special joy and gladness. "By the symbols of joy and gladness he bade us be joyful and glad when we fast" (Photius, in Suicer, 1:186). </body></html>
