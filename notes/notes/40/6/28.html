Yet we ought not to forget its special pointedness as addressed to a people who reckoned their garments, not less than their money, as part of their capital, and often expended on them the labour of many weeks or months. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm" title="But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:">Matthew 6:20</a>; <a href="/james/5-2.htm" title="Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.">James 5:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Consider the lilies of the field.</span>—Here again we may think of the lesson as drawn immediately from the surrounding objects.

The eastern princes were often clothed in white robes, (and they were generally accounted a magnificent apparel; see <a href="/esther/8-15.htm" title="And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.">Esther 8:15</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>;) and therefore Calmet and Doddridge properly refer this dress of Solomon to the <span class="ital">whiteness of the lilies, </span>rather than to <span class="ital">tulips of various colours. </span>or <span class="ital">a purple kind of lily, </span>supposed by Ray (<span class="ital">On the Creation, </span>page 107,) to be here intended by <span class="greekheb">κρινα</span>, the word we render <span class="ital">lilies. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field, </span>&c. — If an inanimate thing, so trifling in its nature, and uncertain in its duration, is thus beautifully adorned, will not God take care to clothe you, who are more valuable, as ye are men endowed with reason, but especially as ye are my servants and friends? <span class="ital">The grass of the field, </span>is a general expression, including both herbs and flowers. Dr. Campbell renders the original expression, <span class="greekheb">τον χορτον</span>, <span class="ital">the herbage, </span>and observes, that it is evident from the <span class="ital">lily </span>being included under the term, that more is meant by it than is signified with us by the word <span class="ital">grass; </span>and he quotes Grotius as remarking that the Hebrews ranked the whole vegetable system under two classes, <span class="greekheb">עצ</span>, <span class="ital">gnets, </span>and <span class="greekheb">עשּׁב</span>, <span class="ital">gnesheb, </span>the former including all sorts of shrubs, as well as trees, and the latter every kind of plant, which has not, like trees and shrubs, a perennial stalk. <span class="ital">Which to-day is </span>— Namely, in the field; <span class="ital">and to-morrow is cast into the oven </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">κλιβανον</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">the oven, </span>is interpreted by some <span class="ital">a still, </span>for distilling herbs; but “there is no reason,” says Macknight, “to alter the translation, since it appears from <a href="/matthew/13-10.htm" title="And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?">Matthew 13:10</a>, that they used some kind of vegetable substances for fuel, particularly <span class="ital">tares, </span>which, if they were annuals, might be sufficiently dry for immediate use by the time they were cut down, as the <span class="ital">herb of the field </span>is here said to be; or <span class="ital">to-morrow, </span>in the text may mean, not the day immediately after the herbs are cut down, but any time soon after, the expression being proverbial, and easily admitting of this signification.” Dr. Campbell is of the same mind, observing that he had not seen a vestige of evidence in any ancient author, that the art of distillation was then known, or any authority, sacred or profane, for translating the word <span class="greekheb">κλιβανος</span>, <span class="ital">a still. </span>He thinks the scarcity of fuel in those parts, both formerly and at present, fully accounts for their having recourse to withered herbs for heating their ovens. It accounts also, he supposes, for the frequent recourse of the sacred penmen to those similitudes, whereby things found unfit for any nobler purpose, are represented as reserved for the fire. Add to this, Shaw (<span class="ital">Trav. </span>page 25,) and Harmer (chap. 4. obs. 6,) inform us, that myrtle, rosemary, and other plants, are made use of in Barbary to heat their ovens. Our Lord, to check every kind of distrust of the divine providence, and to encourage confidence therein, adds, <span class="ital">O ye of little faith </span>— Or, <span class="ital">O ye distrustful, </span>as Campbell renders the word <span class="greekheb">ολιγοπιστοι</span>, observing, that “it is quite in the genius of the Greek language to express, by such compound words, what in other languages is expressed by a more simple term.” It is hardly necessary to observe here, that “it does not follow from our Lord’s application of the expression, <span class="ital">O ye of little faith, </span>that it is an exercise of faith to sit with our arms folded, expecting support from the divine providence, without any action of our own; but after having done what prudence directs for providing the necessaries of life, we ought to trust in God, believing that he will make our labours effectual by his blessing.” It is remarked here by Dr. Doddridge, that the word <span class="greekheb">αμφιεννυσιν</span>, rendered <span class="ital">clothe </span>the grass of the field, properly implies the putting on a complete dress, that surrounds the body on all sides; and beautifully expresses that external membrane, which (like the skin in a human body) at once adorns the tender fabric of the vegetable, and guards it from the injuries of the weather. Every microscope in which a flower is viewed, gives a lively comment on this text.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:25-34 There is scarcely any sin against which our Lord Jesus more warns his disciples, than disquieting, distracting, distrustful cares about the things of this life. This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consider the lilies of the field - The fourth consideration is taken from the care which God bestows on lilies. Watch the growing of the lily. It toils not, and it spins not; yet night and day it grows. With a beauty with which the most splendid monarch of the East was never adorned. it expands its blossom and fills the air with fragrance. Yet this beauty is of short continuance. Soon it will fade, and the beautiful flower will be cut down and burned. God "so little" regards the bestowment of beauty and ornament as to give the highest adorning to this which is soon to perish. When He thus clothes a lily - a fair flower, soon to perish - will he be unmindful of his children? Shall they dear to His heart and imbued with immortality - lack that which is proper for them, and shall they in vain trust the God that decks the lily of the valley?<p>Even Solomon in all his glory ... - The common dress of Eastern kings was purple, but they sometimes wore white robes. See <a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>. It is to this that Christ refers.

The Persic version mentions both rose and lily; the one being beautifully clothed in red, the other in white. Christ does not direct his hearers to the lilies, or flowers which grow in the garden which receive some advantage from the management and care of the gardener; but to those of the field, where the art and care of men were not so exercised: and besides, he was now preaching on the mount, in an open place; and as he could point to the fowls of the air, flying in their sight, so to the flowers, in the adjacent fields and valleys: which he would have them look upon, with their eyes, consider and contemplate in their minds, <p>how they grow; in what variety of garbs they appear, of what different beautiful colours, and fragrant odours, they were; and yet <p>they toil not, or do not labour as husbandmen do, in tilling their land, ploughing their fields, and sowing them with flax, out of which linen garments are made: <p>neither do they spin; the flax, when plucked and dressed, as women do, in order for clothing; nor do they weave it into cloth, or make it up into garments, as other artificers do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And why take ye thought for raiment?

He insists on the needlessness (ver. 28) and on the comparative uselessness (ver. 29) of anxiety about it, since even the king who had the greatest opportunities could not vie in clothing with a single lily. Flowers have this glorious clothing (ver. 30), though they are so perishable: much more shall you be clothed. <span class="cmt_word">Consider</span> (ver. 26, note). <span class="cmt_word">The lilies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). Though there are many kinds of lilies in Palestine, and some of brilliant colouring (particularly the purple and white Huleh lily found round Nazareth), yet none of them grows in such abundance as to give the tone to the colouring of the flowers generally. It seems, therefore, probable that the word is employed loosely. So, perhaps, in the LXX. of <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31, 33, 34</a>, and other passages, where it represents the "flowers" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>) on the candlestick.

If a single species is to be thought of, Canon Tristram would prefer the <span class="accented">Anemone coronaria</span> of our gardens, which is "the most gorgeously painted, the most conspicuous in spring, and the most universally spread of all the floral treasures of the Holy Land" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 464, edit. 1877). <span class="cmt_word">Of the field</span>.

Its insertion emphasizes the spontaneity of origin, the absence of cultivation, the "waste" as not grown for the comfort or pleasure of man. <span class="cmt_word">How they grow</span>. Professor Drummond's beautiful remarks upon this verse ('Natural Law,' etc.) do not belong to exegesis, but to homily, for the stress of our Lord's words lies on "grow," not on "how;" he is thinking of the fact, net the manner of their growth. They toil not; to produce the raw material. <span class="cmt_word">Neither do they spin</span>; to manufacture it when produced. "Illud virorum est, qui agrum colunt; hoc mulie-rum domisedarum" (Wetstein). </body></html>
