The “sackcloth” took the place of the usual raiment, “ashes” on the head, of the usual unguents (<a href="/nehemiah/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloths, and earth on them.">Nehemiah 9:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a>). The tradition of the Pharisees starting from the true principle that fasting was one way of attaining self-control, and that as a discipline it was effectual in proportion as it was systematic, fixed on the fasts “twice in the week,” specified in the prayer of the Pharisee (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>); and the second and fifth days of the week were fixed, and connected with some vague idea that Moses went up Mount Sinai on the one, and descended on the other. Our Lord, we may note, does not blame the principle, or even the rule, on which the Pharisees acted. He recognises fasting, as He recognises almsgiving and prayer, and is content to warn His disciples against the ostentation that vitiates all three, the secret self-satisfaction under the mask of contrition, the “pride that apes humility.” The very words, “when thou fastest” contain an implied command.<p><span class= "bld">Of a sad countenance.</span>—Strictly, <span class= "ital">of sullen look, </span>the moroseness of affected austerity rather than of real sorrow.<p><span class= "bld">They disfigure their faces.</span>—The verb is the same as that translated “corrupt” in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>.

God sees in secret, and will reward openly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover, when ye fast - The word "fast" literally signifies to abstain from food and drink, whether from necessity or as a religious observance. It is, however, commonly applied in the Bible to the latter. It is, then, an expression of grief or sorrow. Such is the constitution of the body, that in a time of grief or sorrow we are not disposed to eat; or, we have no appetite. The grief of the "soul" is so absorbing as to destroy the natural appetites of the "body." People in deep affliction eat little, and often pine away and fall into sickness, because the body refuses, on account of the deep sorrow of the mind, to discharge the functions of health. "Fasting, then, is the natural expression of grief." It is not arbitrary; it is what every person in sorrow naturally does. This is the foundation of its being applied to religion as a sacred rite. It is because the soul, when oppressed and burdened by a sense of sin, is so filled with grief that the body refuses food. It is, therefore, appropriate to scenes of penitence, of godly sorrow, of suffering, and to those facts connected with religion which are suited to produce grief, as the prevalence of iniquity, or some dark impending calamity, or storm, or tempest, pestilence, plague, or famine. It is also useful to humble us, to bring us to reflection, to direct the thoughts away from the allurements of this world to the bliss of a better. It is not acceptable except it be the "real expression," of sorrow; the natural effect of the feeling that we are burdened with crime.<p>The Jews fasted often. They had four "annual" fasts in commemoration of the capture of Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>, of the burning of the temple <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>, of the death of Gedaliah <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-4.htm">Jeremiah 41:4</a>, and of the commencement of the attack on Jerusalem <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>. In addition to these, they had a multitude of occasional fasts. It was customary, also, for the Pharisees to fast twice a week, <a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>.<p>Of a sad countenance - That is, sour, morose; with assumed expressions of unfelt sorrow.<p>They disfigure their faces - That is, they do not anoint and wash themselves as usual: they are uncombed, filthy, squalid, and haggard. It is said that they were often in the habit of throwing ashes on their heads and faces; and this, mixing with their tears, served still further to disfigure their faces. So much pains will people take, and so much suffering will they undergo, and so much that is ridiculous will they assume, to impose on God and people. But they deceive neither. God sees through the flimsy veil. Human eyes can pierce a disguise so thin. Hypocrites overact their part. Not having the genuine principles of piety at heart, they know not what is its proper expression, and hence they appear supremely contemptible and abominable. Never should people exhibit outwardly more than they feel; and never should they attempt to exhibit anything for the mere sake of ostentation.<p>They have their reward - They have all that they desired - the praise of men and "the pleasure of ostentation."

This is to be understood, not so much of their public stated fasts, and which were by divine appointment, as of their private fasts; which, with the Jews, were very frequent and numerous, and particularly every Monday and Thursday; see <a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a> in which they affected great severity, and is here condemned by Christ: <p>be not as the hypocrites, the Scribes and Pharisees, <p>of a sad countenance; who put on very mournful airs, and dismal looks; made wry faces, and distorted countenances; banished all pleasantry and cheerfulness from them, so that they looked quite like other men than they really were; <p>for they disfigure their faces; not by covering them out of sight, by putting a veil over them, as some have thought; but they neglected to wash their faces, and make them clean, as at other times; and not only so, but put ashes upon their heads, and other methods they used: they discoloured their faces, or "made" them "black", as the Arabic version reads it; that they might look as if they became so through fasting: and such persons were in great esteem, and thought to be very religious. It is said (f), in commendation of R. Joshua ben Chanamah, that all his days , "his face was black", through fastings; and this is said (g) to be the reason of Ashur's name, in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-5.htm">1 Chronicles 4:5</a> because "his face was black" with fasting: yea, they looked upon such a disfiguring of the face to be meritorious, and what would be rewarded hereafter. <p>"Whoever (say they (h)) , "makes his face black", on account of the law in this world, God will make his brightness to shine in the world to come.'' <p>Now these practices they used, <p>that they might appear unto men to fast: so that either they did not really fast, when they pretended to it; only put on these outward appearances, that men might think they did; or, not content with real fasting, which they must be conscious of themselves, and God knew, they took such methods, that it might appear to men that they fasted, and that they might be taken notice of, and applauded by them: for their view in fasting was not to satisfy their own consciences, or please God, but that they might have glory of men.

Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Christ does not abolish it, but regulates it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> yet fasting is mentioned much less often in the true text of the New Testament than in that which,  developed contemporaneously with eccle-siasticism, became the Received Text. <span class="cmt_word">Be</span> <span class="cmt_word">not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.</span> The Revised Version, by inserting a comma between "not" and "as," shows that the true emphasis of the warning lies, not on resemblance to the hypocrites themselves, but on being of a sad countenance, as in fact also the hypocrites were. <span class="accented">The hypocrites</span> (ver. 2, note; cf. also 'Didache,' &sect; 8, "But let not your fasts be with the hypocrites," where, however, the thought is rather of hypocrites as representing the Pharisaic, the typically Jewish party). The early Jewish Christians are bidden in the 'Didache' to avoid the fasting-days chosen by the Jews. <span class="accented">Be not.</span> Our Lord does not forbid even this sad countenance if it be, so to speak, natural; but do not, because you fast, therefore purposely become so (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in sign of your supposed sorrow for sin (cf. Ecclus. 19:26). <span class="accented">Of a sad countenance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); gloomy, especially- in knitting the brows. In <a href="/daniel/1-10.htm">Daniel 1:10</a> (Thee-dotion) used of merely physically bad looks (cf. 'Test. XII. Patr.,' &sect; 4, of the look of a man whose liver is out of order). In the New Testament elsewhere only <a href="/luke/24-17.htm">Luke 24:17</a>, "And they stood still, looking sad," Revised Version (cf. <a href="/genesis/40-7.htm">Genesis 40:7</a>; Ecclus. 25:23). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">they disfigure.</span> The play on the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">. .</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, hardly to be reproduced in English," They <span class="accented">disfigure</span>...  that they may <span class="accented">figure</span> before men as fasting") points to the 'Gospel having been originally composed in Greek (see Introduction, p. 13.). It is curious that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> comes elsewhere in Matthew only in vers. 19, 20, while in the whole of the New Testament it only comes twice besides: <a href="/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a> (from the LXX.) and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). As ver. 19 is peculiar to Matthew, and ver. 20 is a corollary to it though in part found also in <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>, the whole passage vers. 16-20 is probably either due to the author of the First Gospel or else derived by him from some one source. In this connexion it may be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes in the New Testament only in ver. 18 (twice). Physical disfigurement, common in many nations as a sign of grief, such as tearing or marking the flesh, is not to be thought of, since this was forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, too, has no such connotation, but rather hiding out of sight, hence causing to vanish, destroy (ver. 19); here, in the sense of giving a strange, unpleasant appearance, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by ashes, or by not washing, or even by covering part of the face or the head (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a><span class="cmt_word">;</span> <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">they may appear unto men to fast</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">that they may be seen</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not the mere appearance, as though there were appearance only, but the being seen as fasting - conspicuousness, not mere semblance. Hence <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is expressed (contrast ver. 5), since while in ver. 5 not the praying but the piety that induced it is to be made apparent, here it is the very fact itself of fasting, which, except for these external signs, might escape human notice. <span class="cmt_word">They have</span> (ver. 2, note). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye fast (&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Observe the force of the present tense as indicating action in progress: Whenever ye may be fasting.<p>Of a sad countenance (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>An uncommon word in the New Testament, occurring only here and at <a href="/luke/24-17.htm">Luke 24:17</a>. Trench ("Studies in the Gospels") explains it by the older sense of the English dreary, as expressing the downcast look of settled grief, pain, or displeasure. In classical Greek it also signifies sullenness and affected gravity. Luther renders, Look not sour.<p>Disfigure (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The idea is rather conceal than disfigure. There is a play upon this word and &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (they may appear) which is untranslatable into English: they conceal or mask their true visage that they may appear unto men. The allusion is to the outward signs of humiliation which often accompanied fasting, such as being unwashed and unshaven and unanointed. "Avoid," says Christ, "the squalor of the unwashed face and of the unkempt hair and beard, and the rather anoint thy head and wash thy face, so as to appear (&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;&#x3c2;) not unto men, but unto God as fasting." Wycliffe's rendering is peculiar: They put their faces out of kindly terms. </body></html>
