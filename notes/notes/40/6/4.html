Publicity may be a duty, especially in public work. But this—gifts for schools, hospitals, and the like—is hardly contemplated in the word “alms,” which refers rather to acts of mercy, to cases of individual suffering. Ostentation in those acts is what our Lord especially condemns.<p><span class= "bld">Thy Father which seeth in secret.</span>—The attribute which we call the Omniscience of God is commonly dwelt on as calculated to inspire a just fear of the All-seeing One. He sees, we say, the evil deeds that are done in secret. Here it is brought before us as an encouragement and ground of hope. Do we feel isolated, not understood, not appreciated? He sees in secret and will reward.<p><span class= "bld">Shall reward thee openly.</span>—A curious instance of an early attempt to improve on our Lord’s teaching. The adverb “openly” is not found in the best MSS., and is now omitted by most editors. It would seem either as if a false rhetorical taste desired a more complete antithesis, or that the craving for public acknowledgment in the presence of men and angels asserted itself even here, and led men to add to the words of the divine Teacher. It need hardly be said that the addition weakens and lowers the force of the truth asserted. It is not necessarily in this way, “openly,” that God rewards His servants, nor do the words point only to the reward of the last great day. The reward is at once immediate, and, it may be, secret—the hidden manna, the joy with which a stranger doth not intermeddle, and which no man taketh from us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 Our Lord next warned against hypocrisy and outward show in religious duties. What we do, must be done from an inward principle, that we may be approved of God, not that we may be praised of men. In these verses we are cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms. Take heed of it. It is a subtle sin; and vain-glory creeps into what we do, before we are aware. But the duty is not the less necessary and excellent for being abused by hypocrites to serve their pride. The doom Christ passes, at first may seem a promise, but it is their reward; not the reward God promises to those who do good, but the reward hypocrites promise themselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be seen of men, and they are seen of men. When we take least notice of our good deeds ourselves, God takes most notice of them. He will reward thee; not as a master who gives his servant what he earns, and no more, but as a Father who gives abundantly to his son that serves him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not thy left hand know ... - This is a proverbial expression, signifying that the action should be done as secretly as possible. The Hebrews often attribute actions to members which properly belong to persons. The encouragement for performing our acts of charity in secret is that it will be pleasing to God; that he will see the act, however secret it may be, and will openly reward it. If the reward is not granted in this life, it will be in the life to come. In multitudes of cases, however, alms given to the poor are "lent to the Lord" <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, and will be repaid in this life. Rarely, perhaps never, has it been found that the man who is liberal to the poor has ever suffered by it in his worldly circumstances. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. That thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly&#8212;The word "Himself" appears to be an unauthorized addition to the text, which the sense no doubt suggested.

The speech is rather metaphorical, prohibiting all ostentation in acts of charity, and inviting others to take notice of them, as Jehu invited Jonadab to come and see his zeal, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm" title="And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD.

The thing forbidden under the metaphorical expression is ostentation, and seeking our own honour and applause. The thing commanded is sincerity with respect to our end. The apostle calls it a giving with simplicity, singly aiming at the glorifying of God, by an obedient performance of our duty. He tells us those who give their alms to be honoured of <span class="ital">men have their reward, </span> that is, all which they are like to have; men applaud and cry them up, there is their reward: others shall have their reward from God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">who seeth in secret, </span> and so needeth not such a publication of our good deeds; and he will reward them openly before men and angels at the last day, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a>,32,34</span>, and ordinarily in this life, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/37-25.htm" title="I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.">Psalm 37:25</a> 41:1 <a href="/psalms/112-9.htm" title="He has dispersed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.">Psalm 112:9</a>,10</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thine alms may be in secret,.... May be done in secret, and be kept a secret. The allusion seems to be to the secret chamber, where money was brought privately for the relief of the poor. <p>"There were two chambers in the sanctuary, the one was  , "the chamber of secrets", and the other the chamber of vessels: the chamber of secrets was that into which pious persons put  "in secret", and the poor children of good men were maintained out of it privately (q).'' <p>The Jews say many things in favour of doing alms privately. <p>"Greater, (say they (r),) is he that gives alms  in secret, than Moses our master.'' <p>They tell us (s), that <p>"R. Jannai seeing a certain man give Zuz (a piece of money) to a poor man publicly, said unto him, it would have been better, if thou hadst not have given him anything, than to have given him in this manner.'' <p>This was the practice of the ancient religious Jews, to give their alms privately; but the Scribes and Pharisees had brought that practice into disuse, and which our Lord labours to restore; adding, for encouragement, <p>and thy Father, which seeth in secret; beholds all secret actions, and knows the secret springs of actions, <p>himself shall reward thee openly; in the great day of account, before angels and men, when all secret things shall be brought to light, and every good man have praise of God. This duty, of giving alms to the poor, is mentioned by Christ before prayer to God; it may be for this reason, because it was usual to give alms before prayer. <p>"The great, or famous men, among the wise men, used to give a Prutah (a small piece of money) to a poor man before every prayer, and after that they prayed; as it is said, "I shall behold thy face in righteousness" (t).'' <p>(q) Misn.
