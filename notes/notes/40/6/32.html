This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For after all these things do the Gentiles seek - That is, those destitute of the true doctrines of religion, and unacquainted with proper dependence on Divine Providence, make it their chief anxiety thus to seek food and clothing. But you, who have a knowledge of your Father in heaven; who know that He will provide for your needs, should not be anxious. Seek first His kingdom; seek first to be righteous, and to become interested in His favor, and all necessary things will be added to you. He has control over all things, and He can give you what you need. He will give you what he deems best for you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek)&#8212;rather, "pursue." Knowing nothing definitely beyond the present life to kindle their aspirations and engage their supreme attention, the heathen naturally pursue present objects as their chief, their only good. To what an elevation above these does Jesus here lift His disciples!<p>for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things&#8212;How precious this word! Food and raiment are pronounced needful to God's children; and He who could say, "No man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him" (Mt 11:27), says with an authority which none but Himself could claim, "Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things." Will not that suffice you, O ye needy ones of the household of faith?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 31,32.

This he here presseth by two arguments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because these are the things which people spend all their thoughts upon, who are not aware that they have souls to take care for, or do not understand the providence of God, or have no such relation to God as Christians have, who call God Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. You have (saith he) a heavenly Father, who, being the God of heaven, knoweth what you need, and, being your Father, will also supply your needs. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For after all these things do the Gentiles seek,.... Or "the nations of the world", as in <a href="/luke/12-30.htm">Luke 12:30</a>. The Syriac reads it so here: the phrase,  "the nations of the world", is used of the Gentiles, in distinction from the Israelites, thousands of times in the Jewish writings; it would be endless to give instances. These knew not God, nor acknowledged his providence; the greater part of them thought, that the soul perished with the body; few of them thought, that anything remained after death; and they that did, spoke very doubtfully of it: wherefore it is no wonder, that such persons should greedily seek after, and be anxiously concerned for all these things, food, raiment, and riches, and a great plenty of them; since this is all the happiness they expect; and imagine, that this is to be acquired by their care, thought, diligence, and industry; having no regard to a superior being, and his all wise providence: but for the Jews, and so Christians, who have a divine revelation, the knowledge of God, and his providence, and of a future state after this life, to act the same part the Heathens do, is exceedingly unbecoming, absurd, and wicked: and besides, such greedy desires, immoderate care, and anxious solicitude, are altogether unnecessary; <p>for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Every word almost, carries in it an argument, to strengthen the faith of God's children, to encourage them to believe, that he will bestow upon them, whatever is needful, for meat, drink, and clothing: he is a "father", and will take care of his children; "their father"; they have interest in him, being related to him, and need not doubt of his paternal care, and affectionate regard to them: their "heavenly" Father, or their Father in heaven; who has all things at his command, who sits there, and does whatever he pleaseth on earth: "he knoweth that they have need"; he knows all things, all their straits, difficulties, wants and necessities; he knows they need every day, "all these things", food and raiment, and cannot do without them: and therefore they may depend upon it, that as it is in his power to relieve them, and their persons and cases are not unknown to him; he who stands in the relation of a father to them, will supply them with whatever is proper and convenient for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/6-32.htm" title="(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.">Matthew 6:32</a>. The <span class="ital">second</span> <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> does not append another reason co-ordinate with the first, but after the injunction contained in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm" title="Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?">Matthew 6:31</a> has been justified by the reference to the heathen (to whom they are not to compare themselves), this same injunction is provided with an <span class="ital">explanation</span> of an encouraging nature, so that the first <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> is <span class="ital">logical</span>, the second <span class="ital">explanatory</span>, as frequently in classical writers (Kühner, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Anab</span>. v. 6. 6. Frotscher, <span class="ital">ad Hieron</span>. xi. 6). The referring of the second <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> to something to be supplied after <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span>, such as “<span class="ital">who know nothing of God</span>” (Tholuck), is arbitrary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἶδε</span> is emphatic; is certainly <span class="ital">known</span> to your Father, and so on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>] <span class="ital">that</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι</span> (Paulus: that, which; Fritzsche: quatenus).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/6-32.htm" title="(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.">Matthew 6:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span>, again a reference to heathen practice; in <a href="/matthew/6-7.htm" title="But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.">Matthew 6:7</a> to their “battology” in prayer, here to the kind of blessings they eagerly ask (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιζητοῦσιν</span>); material only or chiefly; bread, raiment, wealth, etc. I never realised how true the statement of Jesus is till I read the <span class="ital">Vedic Hymns</span>, the prayer book and song book of the Indian Aryans. With the exception of a few hymns to <span class="ital">Varuna</span>, in which sin is confessed and pardon begged, most hymns, especially those to <span class="ital">Indra</span>, contain prayers only for material goods: cows, horses, green pastures, good harvests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To wifeless men thou givest wives,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And joyful mak’st their joyless lives;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thou givest sons, courageous, strong,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To guard their aged sires from wrong,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Lands, jewels, horses, herds of kine,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All kinds of wealth are gifts of thine<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thy friend is never slain; his might<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Is never worsted in the fight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>—Dr. Muir, <span class="ital">Sanskrit Texts</span>, vol. v., p. 137.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>—<span class="greekheb">οἶδεν γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ὑ</span>.: Disciples must rise above the pagan level, especially as they worship not <span class="ital">Indra</span>, but a <span class="ital">Father in heaven</span>, believed in even by the Indian Aryans, in a rude way, under the name of Dyaus-Pitar, Heaven-Father. <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> explains the difference between pagans and disciples. The disciple has a Father who knows, and never forgets, His children’s needs, and who is so regarded by all who truly believe in Him. Such faith kills care. But such faith is possible only to those who comply with the following injunction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/matthew/6-33.htm" title="But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.">Matthew 6:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">ζητεῖτε πρῶτον</span>. There is considerable variation in the text of this counsel. Perhaps the nearest to the original is the reading of [44], which omits <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span> with [45], and inverts the order of <span class="greekheb">βασ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">δικαι</span>. Seek ye His (the Father’s) righteousness and kingdom, though it may be against this that in Luke (<a href="/luke/12-31.htm" title="But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.">Luke 12:31</a>) the kingdom only is mentioned, <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> also being omitted: Seek ye His kingdom. This may have been the original form of the <span class="ital">logion</span>, all beyond being interpretation, true though unnecessary. Seeking the kingdom means seeking righteousness as the <span class="ital">summum bonum</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> is implied in such a quest. Some (Meyer, Sevin, Achelis) think there is no second, not even a subordinate seeking after earthly goods, all that to be left in God’s hands, our sole concern the kingdom. That is indeed the ideal heroic attitude. Yet practically it comes to be a question of first and second, supreme and subordinate, and if the kingdom be indeed first it will keep all else in its proper place. The <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>, like the prayer against temptation, indicates consideration for weakness in the sincere.—<span class="greekheb">προστεθήσεται</span>, shall be <span class="ital">added</span>, implying that the main object of quest will certainly be secured.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">the Gentiles seek</span>] Seek with eagerness.
