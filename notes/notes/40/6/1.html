Its excellence had been that it laid stress, as the religion of Islam did afterwards, on the three great duties of the religious life, almsgiving, fasting, and prayer, rather than on sacrifices and offerings. Verbally, Pharisaism accepted on this point the widest and most spiritual teaching of the prophets, and so its home was in the Synagogue rather than the Temple, and it gained a hold on the minds of the people which the priests never gained. But a subtle evil found its way even here. Love of praise and power, rather than spontaneous love, and self-denial, and adoration, was the mainspring of their action, and so that which is the essence of all religion was absent even from the acts in which the purest and highest form of religion naturally shows itself.<p><span class= "bld">Your alms.</span>—The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">righteousness,</span> and obviously with a far truer meaning, as the wider word which branches off afterwards into the three heads of alms, fasting, prayer. In Rabbinic language the whole was often used for the part, and “righteousness” was identified with “mercifulness,” and that with giving money. The Greek version of the LXX. often renders the Hebrew word for <span class= "ital">righteousness</span> by “alms.” In the New Testament, however, there is no such narrowing of its meaning, and here the full significance of the word is fixed by its use in <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>. The reading “alms” probably arose from a misconception of the real meaning of the passage, and the consequent assumption that it simply introduced the rule given in <a href="/context/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2-3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To be seen of them.</span>—It is the motive, and not the fact of publicity, that vitiates the action. The high ideal of the disciple of Christ is to let his light shine “before men” (the self-same words are used in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a> as here), and yet to be indifferent to their praise or even their opinion. In most religious men there is probably a mingling of the two motives, and we dare not say at what precise stage the presence of the lower overpowers the higher. It is enough to remember that it is the little speck which may taint the whole character till it loses all its life.<p><span class= "bld">Of your Father which is in heaven.</span>—More accurately, <span class= "ital">with your Father,</span> as meaning, “in His estimate.” The act is not done to and for Him, and therefore (speaking after the manner of men) He looks on it as having no claim to payment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take heed that ye do not your alms, </span>&c. — As some copies and very ancient versions read <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσυνην</span>, <span class="ital">righteousness, </span>instead of <span class="greekheb">ελεημοσυνην</span>, <span class="ital">alms-deeds, </span>and several of the fathers quote the passage so, “I choose, with Beza,” says Dr. Doddridge, “to follow that reading; because it prevents the appearance of a tautology in the following words, and makes this verse a general and very proper introduction to the remaining part of the section, in which the caution is branched out into the particular heads of <span class="ital">alms, prayer, </span>and <span class="ital">fasting.</span>” The doctor therefore reads, <span class="ital">Take heed that ye practise not your righteousness, </span>in which interpretation of the clause, and for similar reasons, he is followed by Dr. Campbell. The verse is a general caution against vain glory in any of our good works, all which are here summed up together in the comprehensive word, <span class="ital">righteousness. </span>This general caution our Lord applies, in the sequel, to the three principal branches of it, relating to our neighbour, <a href="/context/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.

What we do, must be done from an inward principle, that we may be approved of God, not that we may be praised of men. In these verses we are cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms. Take heed of it. It is a subtle sin; and vain-glory creeps into what we do, before we are aware. But the duty is not the less necessary and excellent for being abused by hypocrites to serve their pride. The doom Christ passes, at first may seem a promise, but it is their reward; not the reward God promises to those who do good, but the reward hypocrites promise themselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be seen of men, and they are seen of men. When we take least notice of our good deeds ourselves, God takes most notice of them. He will reward thee; not as a master who gives his servant what he earns, and no more, but as a Father who gives abundantly to his son that serves him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take heed that ye do not your alms - The word "alms" here denotes liberality to the poor and needy. In the margin, as in the best editions of the Greek it is "righteousness;" either referring to almsgiving as eminently a righteous act, or more probably including all that is specified in this and the following verses - almsgiving, prayer, fasting, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2-18</a>. Our Saviour here does not positively command his disciples to aid the poor, but supposes that they would do it of course, and gives them directions how to do it. It is the nature of religion to help those who are really needy; and a real Christian does not wait to be "commanded" to do it, but only asks for the opportunity. See <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>; <a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>.<p>Before men ... - Our Lord does not require us never to give alms before people, but only forbids our doing it "to be seen of them," for the purposes of ostentation and to seek their praise. To a person who is disposed to do good from a right motive, it matters little whether it be in public or in private. The only thing that renders it even desirable that our good deeds should be seen is that God may be glorified. See <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>.<p>Otherwise - If your only motive for doing it is to be seen by people, God will not reward you. Take heed, therefore, that you do not do it to be seen, "otherwise" God will not reward you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Sermon on the Mount&#8212;continued.<p>Mt 6:1-18. Further Illustration of the Righteousness of the Kingdom&#8212;Its Unostentatiousness.<p>General Caution against Ostentation in Religious Duties (Mt 6:1).<p>1. Take heed that ye do not your alms&#8212;But the true reading seems clearly to be "your righteousness." The external authority for both readings is pretty nearly equal; but internal evidence is decidedly in favor of "righteousness." The subject of the second verse being "almsgiving" that word&#8212;so like the other in Greek&#8212;might easily be substituted for it by the copyist: whereas the opposite would not be so likely. But it is still more in favor of "righteousness," that if we so read the first verse, it then becomes a general heading for this whole section of the discourse, inculcating unostentatiousness in all deeds of righteousness&#8212;Almsgiving, Prayer, and Fasting being, in that case, but selected examples of this righteousness; whereas, if we read, "Do not your alms," &c., this first verse will have no reference but to that one point. By "righteousness," in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading features&#8212;in opposition to traditional perversions of it&#8212;it is the great object of this discourse to open up: that righteousness of which the Lord says, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Mt 5:20). To "do" this righteousness, was an old and well-understood expression. Thus, "Blessed is he that doeth righteousness at all times" (Ps 106:3). It refers to the actings of righteousness in the life&#8212;the outgoings of the gracious nature&#8212;of which our Lord afterwards said to His disciples, "Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples" (Joh 15:8).<p>before men, to be seen of them&#8212;with the view or intention of being beheld of them. See the same expression in Mt 5:28. True, He had required them to let their light so shine before men that they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven (Mt 5:16). But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our righteousness for self-glorification. In fact, the doing of the former necessarily implies our not doing the latter.<p>otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven&#8212;When all duty is done to God&#8212;as primarily enjoining and finally judging of it&#8212;He will take care that it be duly recognized; but when done purely for ostentation, God cannot own it, nor is His judgment of it even thought of&#8212;God accepts only what is done to Himself. So much for the general principle. Now follow three illustrations of it.<p>Almsgiving (Mt 6:2-4).<span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven....">Matthew 6:1-4</a></span> Christ continuing his sermon, giveth directions about<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>alms giving,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Some copies read, "take heed that ye do not your righteousness", &amp;c. which is a very good reading: but then, by "righteousness", is not meant righteousness, as comprehending all other righteous acts, as particularly alms, prayer, and fasting, hereafter mentioned; but alms only; nothing being more common with the Jews than to call alms   "righteousness": and whatever word Matthew made use of, there is no doubt to be made of it, but this was the word Christ used. Now alms was so called, because it is a righteous action, which ought to be performed; and to withhold from the poor what is meet, is to deal unrighteously: hence we read of the "mammon of unrighteousness"; by which is meant, not money unrighteously got, but that which is unrighteously kept from the poor: also it might be so called, because the Jews very much placed their justifying righteousness before God in the performance of it: let us first see how, according to them, it was to be done, and then what confidence they placed in it, and how much they made use of it. The account Maimonides (f) gives is as follows, who observes: that <p>"we are bound to take heed to the commandment of alms more than all the affirmative commands; because alms is a sign of a "righteous" man, the seed of Abraham our father; as it is said, in <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>. Nor is the throne of Israel established, nor can the law of truth stand, but by alms; as it is said, <a href="/proverbs/16-19.htm">Proverbs 16:19</a>. Nor shall Israel be redeemed, but by alms, according to <a href="/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>. There are (says he) eight degrees in giving alms, the one above another; the highest, than which there is none higher, is this; when one relieves an Israelite, and gives him a gift, or lends to him, or takes him into partnership, or finds him work, so that he strengthens his hands before he stands in need of asking; and of this it is said, and "thou shalt relieve him, a stranger and a sojourner, that he may live with thee": which is as much as to say, relieve him before he falls, and is brought to necessity. The next to this is, when a man gives alms to the poor, and he knows not to whom he gives; nor does the poor man know of whom he receives; for, behold, this is doing it for the sake of it; as the chamber of secrets, which was in the sanctuary, into which righteous men privately put, and the poor children of good men were privately supported: and the next to this is, when a man puts into the alms chest: and a man does not put into the alms chest except he knows that the governor is faithful and wise, and knows how to manage as should be; such an one as R. Chananiah ben Tradion. The next to this is, when the giver knows to whom he gives, but the poor man does not know from whom he receives; as the great ones of the wise men, who used to go secretly, and cast their money at the doors of the poor; and this is right to do, and a good method it is when the governors of alms do not dispose aright. The next to this is, when the poor man knows of whom he takes, but does not know the giver; as the great men among the wise men, who used to bind up their money in linen cloths, and put them behind them, and the poor came and took them, that they might not be ashamed. The next to this is, when a man puts it into his hands before he asks. The next to this is, when he gives to him after he has asked. The next to this is, when he gives to him less than is proper, with a pleasant countenance. The next to this is, when he gives with grief.'' <p>Now this work, or duty, they magnify at a very great rate: not content to say (g), that <p>"he that does alms, does that which is more excellent than all offerings;'' <p>they further affirm (h), that <p>"giving of alms and beneficence  , "are equal to the whole law";'' <p>or, it is all one as if a man performed the whole law. Moreover, they give (i) out, <p>"that whoever takes of his goods, and does alms with them, he shall be delivered from the "damnation of hell".'' <p>Yea, they reckon that this gives a right and title to eternal life (k). <p>"He that says, let this "sela", or "shekel", be for alms, that his children may live, and that he may be worthy of the life of the world to come, lo! this is , "a perfect righteous man".'' <p>Or, as elsewhere (l) expressed, <p>"let this sela be for alms, that my son may live, and that he may be a son of the world to come; lo! this is a perfect righteous man.'' <p>Thus, you see, they looked upon it as their righteousness; and what made them heirs of heaven, and gave them a title to eternal glory. Now our Lord advises them to take heed, as what would be of bad consequence, and very detrimental to them, that they did not their alms before men, <p>to be seen of them; not but alms may be lawfully done before, or in the sight of men, and a good end may be answered by it; namely, to stir up others to acts of liberality; but then this must not be done with this view, to be seen of men, in order to gain their applause, and a good name among them, <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Take heed that ye do not your <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> reward of your Father which is in heaven.</span><p>(1) Ambition makes alms vain.<p>(a) This word reward is always taken in the scriptures for a free recompense, and therefore the schoolmen fondly set it to be answerable to a deserving, which they call merit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>. <span class="ital">Connection</span>: However (<span class="greekheb">προσέχετε δέ</span>, <span class="ital">be upon your guard</span>), to those <span class="ital">doctrines and prescriptions</span> regarding the true <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, I must add a <span class="ital">warning</span> with reference to the <span class="ital">practice</span> of it (<span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span>, <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1 John 3:7</a>).

The design of the whole discourse is to teach true righteousness; (see ch. <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>, and <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm" title="But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.">Matthew 6:33</a>); and this reading accords with that design.

Of these he instances three: alms (vers. 2-4), prayer (vers. 5-8, 9-15), fasting (vers. 16-18). It is, indeed, true that the performance of these duties on special occasions was implied in the Pentateuch (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a>); but there are no regulations concerning their observance in ordinary and daily life.
