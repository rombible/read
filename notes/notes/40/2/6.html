This in part explains the fact that he does not give either the version of the LXX., or a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew, but a free paraphrase. As the Targum, just referred to, belongs to this period, it is perfectly possible that the writer of it may have been one of the Council. At any rate, his Messianic reference of the passage was likely to be dominant. The chief difference for the English reader to note is, that the Hebrew gives “thou art little among the thousands (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as in <a href="/judges/6-15.htm" title="And he said to him, Oh my Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.">Judges 6:15</a>, the families or clans) of Judah;” the version given by St. Matthew, “thou art not the least among the princes.” The prophet contrasts the outward insignificance with the spiritual greatness. The paraphrast sees the outward transfigured by the glory of the spiritual. So again the simpler “out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel” is paraphrased into “out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> feed, as a shepherd) my people Israel.” The fact that the scribes stopped, and did not go on to the words that told of the Ruler as one “whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,” may have arisen either from an unwillingness to bring that aspect of the expected Christ before the mind of Herod, or, possibly, from an equal unwillingness to face it themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/2-6.htm" title="And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.">Matthew 2:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou Bethlehem, </span>&c., <span class="ital">art not the least among the princes of Juda</span> — It is justly observed by Dr. Doddridge, after Erasmus, here, that “when this and several other quotations from the Old Testament, which we find in the New, come to be compared with the original, and even with the Septuagint, it plainly appears that the apostles did not always think it necessary to transcribe the passages they cited, but sometimes contented themselves with giving the general sense in some little diversity of language.” The words of Micah, which we render, <span class="ital">Though thou be little, </span>may be rendered, <span class="ital">Art thou little? </span>And his expression, <span class="ital">thousands of Judah; </span>and that of the evangelist here, <span class="ital">princes, </span>or <span class="ital">governors of Judah, </span>are in sense the same, the word <span class="ital">thousands </span>being used by the prophet, in allusion to the first division of the tribes of Israel into thousands, hundreds, and other subordinate divisions, over every one of which thousands was a <span class="ital">prince </span>or chief. But for a full explanation of both passages the reader is referred to the note on <a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace often use most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and his salvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish enough to hope for success therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By the prophet - The Sanhedrin answered without hesitation. The question where he would be born had been settled by prophecy. This prophecy is found in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. In that prophecy both the place of his birth and the character of the Messiah are so clearly set forth that there was no room to doubt. It will be observed that there is a considerable difference between the passage as quoted by the Sanhedrin and as it stands in Micah. The main point, however, is retained - the place of his birth. We are not concerned, therefore, in showing how these passages can be reconciled. Matthew, moreover, is not responsible for the correctness of the quotation. He affirms only that the chief priests and scribes gave this answer to Herod, and that Herod was satisfied. Admitting that they did not quote the passage correctly, it does not prove that Matthew has not reported their answer as they gave it, and this is all that he pretends to give.<p>Art not the least - In Micah, "though thou be little." Though a small place so far as population is concerned, yet it shall not be small, or be the least in honor; for the Messiah shall be born there. His birth gave the place an honor which could not be conferred on the larger cities by all their numbers, their splendor, and their wealth. The birth of a distinguished personage was always supposed to give honor and importance to a city or country. Thus, seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to Homer; Stratford-upon-Avon is distinguished as the birthplace of Shakespeare; and Corsica as the birthplace of Napoleon.<p>A Governor - A ruler. This is one of the characters of the Messiah, who is the king of his people, <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>. The word "rule" here means to rule as a shepherd does his flock, in faithfulness and tenderness. Compare <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&#8212;the "in" being familiarly left out, as we say, "London, Middlesex."<p>art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, &c.&#8212;This quotation, though differing verbally, agrees substantially with the Hebrew and the Septuagint. For says the prophet, "Though thou be little, yet out of thee shall come the Ruler"&#8212;this honor more than compensating for its natural insignificance; while our Evangelist, by a lively turn, makes him say, "Thou art not the least: for out of thee shall come a Governor"&#8212;this distinction lifting it from the lowest to the highest rank. The "thousands of Juda," in the prophet, mean the subordinate divisions of the tribe: our Evangelist, instead of these, merely names the "princes" or heads of these families, including the districts which they occupied.<p>that shall rule&#8212;or "feed," as in the Margin.<p>my people Israel&#8212;In the Old Testament, kings are, by a beautiful figure, styled "shepherds" (Eze 34:1-10, &c.). The classical writers use the same figure. The pastoral rule of Jehovah and Messiah over His people is a representation pervading all Scripture, and rich in import. (See Ps 23:1-6; Isa 40:11; Eze 37:24; Joh 10:11; Re 7:17). That this prophecy of Micah referred to the Messiah, was admitted by the ancient Rabbins.<p>The Wise Men Despatched to Bethlehem by Herod to See the Babe, and Bring Him Word, Make a Religious Offering to the Infant King, but Divinely Warned, Return Home by Another Way (Mt 2:7-12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 5,6. It was (as it seems) so received a tradition, and interpretation of <span class="bld"><a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a></span>, that they gave him an answer without any hesitation, telling him he was to be born <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in Bethlehem of Judea; </span> this they confirm by the prophecy of the prophet Micah, <span class="bld"><a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a></span>; so confirming the Son of the virgin Mary (at unawares) to be the Messiah from the testimony of the prophet Micah. The words in Micah something vary from those here mentioned; they are thus: <span class="ital">But thou, Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.</span> We must know, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the writers of the New Testament, in their quotations out of the Old Testament, ordinarily quote only so much of them as makes to their purpose, and not always in the very terms in which they are found in the Old Testament: but keeping to the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That it is more than probable that the evangelist keeps to the words in which the priests and scribes delivered in their answer to the king, for in this relation he is but reciting their answer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sole question propounded to them was: What the place was, where the Messiah, according to their records, was to be born? They answer: In Bethlehem Judah: they prove their answer from the testimony of the prophet. If any object that the prophet calls it Bethlehem Ephratah, not Bethlehem Judah, the answer is, that it is in sense the same, for Bethlehem Ephratah was within the tribe of Judah. It should seem by <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a> 48:7</span> that it was formerly in Jacob’s time called Ephrath. Some think that it was a town within Caleb’s portion, and called Ephratah from his second wife, whose name was Ephrath, or Ephratah, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>,50</span>, if it were not the same place, only fortified anew. We read of another Bethlehem in Judah builded by Rehoboam, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm" title="He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,">2 Chronicles 11:6</a></span>; whether it had this addition from its old name in Jacob’s time, or from Caleb’s wife, or to distinguish it from Bethlehem belonging to the tribe of Zebulun, is hard to say: it is plain that that Bethlehem is meant, both by Micah and Matthew, which was in Judah; possibly in tract of time the addition Ephratah was lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, say some, there is a contradiction between Micah and Matthew; Micah saith it was <span class="ital">the least, </span> Matthew saith it was <span class="ital">not the least.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answer:</span> Here is no contradiction; consider Bethlehem itself, it was but a small city, (if it were in Caleb’s lot it is not named), but in other respects it was not the least. It was of old famous for Ibzan, one of the judges, for Elimelech, Boaz, Jesse, David; and now last of all for the birth of Christ, where respect to which the evangelist calls it <span class="ital">not the least; </span> or if he reciteth the scribes’ and priests’ words, they might call it <span class="ital">not the least</span> upon the account of Boaz, Jesse, and David, all which were born or dwelt there; and particularly with respect to Christ, who was born there. The prophet calls it <span class="ital">the least</span> with respect to its state in his time, the evangelist <span class="ital">not the least</span> with respect to its state then, its state being magnified by the birth of Christ. Micah saith <span class="ital">among the thousands.</span> Matthew, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">among the princes.</span> It is the same thing, for, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/1-16.htm" title="These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.">Numbers 1:16</a></span>, their princes were <span class="ital">heads of thousands in Israel.</span> The Jews would by no means have this text interpreted of Christ, but either of Zerubbabel or David: but as to Zerubbabel, he was born in Babylon, not in Bethlehem, and David was dead long before this prophecy; neither could the following words, <span class="ital">whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting, </span> agree to Zerubbabel or David: Zerubbabel’s name tells us where he was born, and we never read that Bethlehem was thus celebrated with reference to David, though he was born there, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.">1 Samuel 16:1</a> 17:58</span>, upon which account it is called <span class="ital">the city of David, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/luke/2-4.htm" title="And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)">Luke 2:4</a></span>. The prophecy certainly related to Christ, and him only, and so is interpreted by the Chaldee paraphrast, who some think was one of this council called by Herod in this cause. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda,.... This prophecy, which the chief priests and scribes produced, as pointing at the place of Christ's birth, is owned by both ancient and later Jews (y) to be a prophecy of the Messiah. The difference between Micah and Matthew is easily reconciled. Bethlehem is called by Micah, Bethlehem Ephratah, and by Matthew, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, and both were one and the same place. Bethlehem Ephratah was in the land of Juda, as appears from the prophecy of Micah itself, from <a href="/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a> and the Septuagint version of <a href="/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a> and is described in this manner by Matthew, partly to distinguish it from another Bethlehem in the land of Zebulun, <a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a> and partly because its other name Ephratah was now disused, and so unknown to Herod, who was unacquainted with the books and prophecies of the Old Testament. Micah says this place was <p>little among the thousands of Judah. Matthew says, "not the least". But in this is no apparent contradiction, it might be "little" and yet "not the least"; besides, it might be "little" and "not little", or "not the least" in different respects, and at different times; it might be little, mean, and contemptible as to worldly splendour, riches, number of inhabitants, pompous buildings, &amp;c. and yet not be little or mean, when considered as the place of the birth of many great persons, such as Booz, Jesse, David, &amp;c. and especially Christ. It might be little in Micah's time, and yet not in Matthew's; especially since it had received a considerable additional honour by Christ's being born there. Moreover, the words in Micah may be rendered, by way of interrogation, "art thou little, or the least?" To which the answer in Matthew is, "no, thou art not the least", &amp;c. or else the word may be understood, and the text be translated thus; "it is a small thing that thou art among the thousands of Judah, for out of thee", &amp;c. a great honour shall be conferred on thee, the Messiah shall spring from thee. Again, what Micah calls "thousands", are in Matthew called "princes"; the reason of this is, because the tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, and every thousand had its prince; so that though here is a difference in words, yet none in sense. What Micah styles "a ruler in Israel", Matthew expresses by "a governor that shall rule or feed my people Israel"; but in this there is no contradiction. Add to all this, that it should be observed, that the Evangelist is not giving a version of his own, but of the chief priests and scribes; and therefore was it ever so faulty, they, and not he, must be chargeable with it; for he has acted the part of a faithful historian in giving it in the words in which they cited it (z). <p>(y) Targum Jon.

This is a paraphrase, with a paraphrastic addition from <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a> (7:7), in order to distinctly identify the ruler with Messiah. Nothing is commoner in Jewish authors than the silent conjunction of quotations from separate contexts. In this case the thought of the shepherd in <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> made the addition from Samuel the more easy. It must also be noticed that the reference of the passage in Micah to Christ is fully borne out by Jewish writers. Though they generally explain the rest of the verse as referring to the long lapse of time from David himself, they understand the ruler to be Messiah. But it is not usual with Jewish interpreters to understand the reference to Bethlehem as implying the place of Messiah's own birth. They generally take it as referring to the home of David, Messiah's ancestor. And this is the more natural meaning of the prophecy. The quotation, however, from the Jerusalem Talmud already given on ver. 1, and the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a> ("the tower of Edar - the place whence King Messiah is about to be revealed in the end of the days"), endorse the thoroughly Jewish character of the reply given to Herod (cf. also <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). If it be asked why St. Matthew does not give an exact and verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the answer may be made that he probably gives the current form of its exposition. The high priests and scribes would have doubtless quoted it accurately <span class="accented">in the process</span> of weighing Micah's statement, but when, as here, they were only reproducing the result that they had arrived at, they would care for only the substance of the prophet's teaching (cf. the paraphrastic rendering of the Targum). <span class="accented">In the land of Judah</span>; Revised Version omits <span class="accented">in</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>). "Bethlehem-Judah" would have presented no difficulty, for a town was often distinguished by the apposition of the name of the district in which it was situated; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ramoth-Gilead, Kedesh-Naphtali. It seems best to explain the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> as a mere expansion of "Judah" (cf. 1 Macc. 5:68, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where probably the thought was Ashdod-Philistia).

The word involves the whole office of the shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, as well as feeding. Hence appropriate and often applied to the guides and guardians of others. Homer calls kings "the shepherds of the people."

In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>, rule is literally to shepherd (compare <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>); but Christ will shepherd his enemies, not with the pastoral crook, but with a sceptre of iron. Finally, Jesus will perpetuate this name and office in heaven among his redeemed ones, for "the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall be their shepherd (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, Rev.). In this verse the word governor is in harmony with the idea of shepherding, since the word &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; originally means one who goes before, or leads the way, and suggests Christ's words about the good shepherd in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a> : "He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out....He goeth before them, and the sheep follow him."<p>Inquired diligently (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Better learned accurately.
