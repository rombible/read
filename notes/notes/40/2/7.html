But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish enough to hope for success therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Privily - Secretly, privately.

Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men&#8212;Herod has so far succeeded in his murderous design: he has tracked the spot where lies his victim, an unconscious babe. But he has another point to fix&#8212;the date of His birth&#8212;without which he might still miss his mark. The one he had got from the Sanhedrim; the other he will have from the sages; but secretly, lest his object should be suspected and defeated. So he<p>inquired of them diligently&#8212;rather, "precisely."<p>what time the star appeared&#8212;presuming that this would be the best clue to the age of the child. The unsuspecting strangers tell him all. And now he thinks he is succeeding to a wish, and shall speedily clutch his victim; for at so early an age as they indicate, He would not likely have been removed from the place of His birth.

He took a good deal of pains in examining them, he sifted them, and inquired of them with much accuracy, and exactness, the precise time of the star's appearing to them, how long ago it was when it was first observed by them; that hereby he might exactly know the age of Christ, and the better execute the bloody design he had formed, should the wise men disappoint him; and the better detect an impostor, should another afterwards arise, and set up himself for the king of the Jews. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/2-7.htm" title="Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.">Matthew 2:7</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Λάθρα</span>] Inconsistently enough, as that could only arouse suspicion; but to adopt secret measures is natural to wickedness!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question after the time of the appearance [of the star] has its reason in this, that the mistrustful Herod already thinks of the possibility of his not seeing the Magi again, and that he will then still have a hold for taking further proceedings against the mysterious child (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm" title="Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.">Matthew 2:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἠκρίβωσε</span>] with the accusative does not mean: <span class="ital">he investigated minutely</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀκριβόω περί τινος</span> may mean this), but: after he had made them come to him secretly, <span class="ital">he obtained from them a minute knowledge</span>, and so on.

He assumed that the event would synchronise with the ascent of the star which the Magi had seen in its rising, and which still continued to be seen (<span class="greekheb">φαινομένου</span>). Therefore he made particular inquiries (<span class="greekheb">ἠκρίβωσε</span>) as to the time of the star, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the time of its first appearing.

Secrecy was doubly necessary. He would not publicly commit himself to acknowledging the rights of the new King, and he would give no opportunity for others to warn the Child's parents of the dangerous interest that Herod was taking in him. Duplicity was very characteristic of Herod; cf. his assassination of Aristobulus the high priest (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:03. 3), and his alluring his son Antipater home to death (ibid., 17:5. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Inquired of them diligently</span>; <span class="accented">learned of them carefully</span> (Revised Version); "lerned of hem bisili" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The stress is not upon Herod's careful questioning, but on the exact information that he obtained. <span class="cmt_word">What time the star appeared</span>. Although this is not the literal translation, it may, perhaps, represent the sense of the original ( <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the participle characterizing the star in its most important relation - its appearance, and the words being treated as a compound expression (cf. <a href="/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9, 12</a>). Herod supposed that the birth of the Babe was synchronous with the first appearance of the star. The translation, however, of the Revised Version margin, "the time of the star that appeared," better suits the exact wording ( <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>;<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the phrase thus including both the first appearance and also the period of continuance (cf. Grotius, "non initium, sed continuitas"). But it is difficult to see What Herod would have learned from this latter particular. Some even think that the star was still visible (Plumptre; Weiss, 'Matthew'), but in this case the joy of the Magi in ver. 10 is not satisfactorily explained. </body></html>
