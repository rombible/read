Did we but look upon the world as our Egypt, the place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only as our Canaan, our home, our rest, we should as readily arise and depart thither, when we are called for, as Joseph did out of Egypt. The family must settle in Galilee. Nazareth was a place held in bad esteem, and Christ was crucified with this accusation, Jesus the Nazarene.

So Joseph and the Virgin had, like Abraham, to "go out, not knowing whither they went," till they should receive further direction.<p>for they are dead which sought the young child's life&#8212;a common expression in most languages where only one is meant, who here is Herod. But the words are taken from the strikingly analogous case in Ex 4:19, which probably suggested the plural here; and where the command is given to Moses to return to Egypt for the same reason that the greater than Moses was now ordered to be brought back from it&#8212;the death of him who sought his life.

That is, as some say, within three or four months, for Herod, they say, no longer outlived this bloody act; and if we may believe historians, he was in his death made a dreadful example of Divine vengeance.

It is probable this apparition was not immediately upon the death of Herod, for Archelaus was reigning, who must be allowed some time to go to Rome, and to have this dignity conferred on him; but soon after he was dead this apparition was, with a command to him to return into the land of Israel, to which he soon yieldeth obedience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Saying, arise, and take the young child and his mother,....

He does not bid him go to Bethlehem or Nazareth, or any particular place, but the land of Israel, where he might go even into any part of it, without fear; and gives this reason for it, <p>for they are dead which sought the young child's life; meaning either Herod only, the plural number being put for the singular; or including Antipater his son with him, who might be equally concerned in seeking the life of Christ; since he was next heir, and whom Herod (z) ordered to be slain about five days before his death; or else designing with him many of the executioners of the infants at Bethlehem, and thereabout; who might have been, as well as he, miserable instances of divine vengeance, for their concern in that barbarous tragedy. <p>(z) Joseph. de Bello Judaico, l. 1. c. 33. sect. 8, 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/2-20.htm" title="Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life....">Matthew 2:20-21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τεθνήκασι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζητοῦντες</span>] is to be understood <span class="ital">simply of Herod</span>.
