Compare the gifts sent by Jacob to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>), and <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a>, for the myrrh and spices; <a href="/psalms/72-15.htm" title="And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.">Psalm 72:15</a>, for the gold; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>, for gold and incense. The patristic interpretation of the gifts as significant—the gold, of kingly power; the incense, of Divinity; the myrrh, of death and embalmment—interesting as it is, cannot be assumed to have been definitely present to the mind of the Evangelist. It is noticeable that there is here no mention of Joseph. Looking to his prominence in St. Matthew’s narrative, we must assume that his absence on the night of their arrival was accidental.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:9-12 What joy these wise men felt upon this sight of the star, none know so well as those who, after a long and melancholy night of temptation and desertion, under the power of a spirit of bondage, at length receive the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with their spirits that they are the children of God. We may well think what a disappointment it was to them, when they found a cottage was his palace, and his own poor mother the only attendant he had. However, these wise men did not think themselves baffled; but having found the King they sought, they presented their gifts to him. The humble inquirer after Christ will not be stumbled at finding him and his disciples in obscure cottages, after having in vain sought them in palaces and populous cities. Is a soul busy, seeking after Christ? Would it worship him, and does it say, Alas! I am a foolish and poor creature, and have nothing to offer? Nothing! Hast thou not a heart, though unworthy of him, dark, hard, and foul? Give it to him as it is, and be willing that he use and dispose of it as it pleases him; he will take it, and will make it better, and thou shalt never repent having given it to him. He shall frame it to his own likeness, and will give thee himself, and be thine for ever. The gifts the wise men presented were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Providence sent these as a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary in their present poor condition. Thus our heavenly Father, who knows what his children need, uses some as stewards to supply the wants of others, and can provide for them, even from the ends of the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house - The place where he was born, or the place where they lived at that time.<p>Fell down - This was the usual way of showing respect or homage among the Jews, <a href="/esther/8-3.htm">Esther 8:3</a>; <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>.<p>Worshipped him - Did him homage as King of the Jews.

It was customary in the East to show respect for persons of distinction by making presents or offerings of this kind. See <a href="/genesis/32-14.htm">Genesis 32:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10-15</a>. This custom is still common in the East, and it is everywhere there unusual to approach a person of distinguished rank without a valuable present.<p>Frankincense - Frankincense is a white resin or gum. It is obtained from a tree by making incisions in the bark, and suffering the gum to flow out. It is highly odoriferous or fragrant when burned, and was therefore used in worship, where it was burned as a pleasant offering to God. See <a href="/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>. It is found in the East Indies, but chiefly in Arabia; and hence it has been supposed probable that the wise men came from Arabia.<p>Myrrh - This was also a production of Arabia, and was obtained from a tree in the same manner as frankincense. The name denotes bitterness, and was given to it on account of its great bitterness. It was used chiefly in embalming the dead, because it had the property of preserving dead bodies from putrefaction. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>, it was much used in Egypt and in Judea. It was obtained from a thorny tree, which grows 8 or 9 feet high. It was at an early period an article of commerce <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>, and was an ingredient of the holy ointment, <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>. It was also used as an agreeable perfume, <a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>. It was also sometimes mingled with wine to form an article of drink. Such a drink was given to our Saviour, when about to be crucified, as a stupefying potion, <a href="/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>; compare <a href="/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>. The offerings here referred to were made because they were the most valuable which the country of the Magi or wise men produced. They were tokens of respect and homage which they paid to the new-born King of the Jews. They evinced their high regard for him, and their belief that he was to be an illustrious prince; and the fact that their deed is recorded with approbation shows us that we should offer our most valuable possessions, our all, to the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men came from far to do him homage, and bowed down, and presented their best gifts and offerings. It is right that we give to him also our hearts, our property, our all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The next clause confirms this.<p>and when they had opened their treasures they presented&#8212;rather, "offered."<p>unto him gifts&#8212;This expression, used frequently in the Old Testament of the oblations presented to God, is in the New Testament employed seven times, and always in a religious sense of offerings to God. Beyond doubt, therefore, we are to understand the presentation of these gifts by the Magi as a religious offering.<p>gold, frankincense, and myrrh&#8212;Visits were seldom paid to sovereigns without a present (1Ki 10:2, &c.; compare Ps 72:10, 11, 15; Isa 60:3, 6). "Frankincense" was an aromatic used in sacrificial offerings; "myrrh" was used in perfuming ointments. These, with the "gold" which they presented, seem to show that the offerers were persons in affluent circumstances. That the gold was presented to the infant King in token of His royalty; the frankincense in token of His divinity, and the myrrh, of His sufferings; or that they were designed to express His divine and human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the very names of whom tradition has handed down&#8212;all these are, at the best, precarious suppositions. But that the feelings of these devout givers are to be seen in the richness of their gifts, and that the gold, at least, would be highly serviceable to the parents of the blessed Babe in their unexpected journey to Egypt and stay there&#8212;that much at least admits of no dispute.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How long the virgin Mary and her holy Child had been there is not expressed; those that think these wise men came within six weeks or two months, judge that Joseph and Mary came thither from Jerusalem after that he had been there offered, to the Lord, of which you read <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-22.htm" title="And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;">Luke 2:22</a></span>; but they are forced, to uphold this, to interpret <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-39.htm" title="And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.">Luke 2:39</a></span>, which saith that after <span class="ital">they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth, </span> of a considerable time after they had performed these things, which seemeth something hard and needless, especially considering Nazareth was Joseph’s own city, i.e. the city where his fixed habitation was. It is most probable that they, after so long absence, went right home, and if the wise men (which is said) found them in Bethlehem, they were gone thither again to visit some relations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They saw the young child with Mary his mother; </span> under what other circumstances the Scripture saith not, but questionless they were very poor and mean, which is a very strong inducement to us to believe that they had a spiritual Divine revelation, that this was a King whose kingdom was not of this world, the true Messiah and Saviour of the world; they would hardly else have treated a poor infant, in an ordinary house and no more attended, at the rate they did, for the text saith they <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fell down and worshipped him; </span> a usual homage indeed which the Eastern nations paid to princes, but they used then to have better evidences of their royal state and dignity than these wise men seemed to have had, if they had not, besides the star, a Divine revelation what manner of King this was to be. We may therefore rather judge that their revelation extended not only to the birth of a King, but of such a King as indeed he was, the eternal Son of God clothed with human flesh; and that their falling down and worshipping him is to be understood of a Divine worship they paid to him, as the Saviour of the world: and so they were the first fruits of the Gentiles, owning and believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. And that their following offerings to him were upon that account, for opening <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">their treasures, they presented to him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> The guesses of those who think that they offered him gold as to a King, frankincense as a High Priest, and myrrh to sweeten the place where he was, I take to be but the product of luxuriant fancies. It is most certain that those Eastern people seldom came to their princes without some presents, and that their presents were usually of the most choice things their country afforded. This is plain from <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a></span>; and if what naturalists tell us be true, that myrrh was only to be found in Arabia, and frankincense in Sabea, (a part of Arabia) and that country also had gold, which it is plain that it had from <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/9-14.htm" title="Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.">2 Chronicles 9:14</a></span>, it makes a very probable argument, that these wise men came from Arabia, which was full of men that were astrologers. The providence of God was wonderfully seen in these presents, by them providing for the sustenance of Joseph, and Mary, and Jesus in that exile which they were soon after to endure. For other allegorical and mystical significations of these presents, they are but conjectures, and the exuberances of men’s fancies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they were come into the house,.... Which they entered without making any inquiry, being fully assured by the star's standing right over it, that this was the house, and here was the king of the Jews, whom they were come to worship; and having entered in "they saw" some copies read  <p>they found the young child, with Mary his mother; in her lap, or arms, or in the house with her, for by this time he might go alone. Joseph perhaps was not at home, but about his business; and which might be so ordered by the providence of God, that so these men might only see the mother of Christ, who had no real father as man; who had they seen Joseph, might have took him to be his proper father. Upon the sight of the young child, <p>they fell down on their knees or faces to the ground, agreeably to the custom of their country, <p>and worshipped him as a king; giving him the same civil honour and respect, as they were wont to do to their own kings and princes; which custom began with Cyrus: for so Xenophon (c) says, that <p>"when the people saw him, , they all worshipped him; either because some were ordered to begin this custom; or else being amazed at the apparatus; or because he seemed to appear so great and beautiful; for before that time none of the Persians worshipped Cyrus.'' <p>And when they had opened their treasures, that is, their purses, bags or boxes, in which they put those things they brought with them necessary for their journey; <p>they presented, or offered to him  <p>gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh: such things as they had; it being usual, not only with the Persians, but other eastern nations, to make presents to kings and great persons, when they made any addresses to them; which generally, among other things, consisted of gold, spices, myrrh, and the like, see <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>. Which last passage referred to, being a prophecy of the Messiah, has been thought by some now to have had its accomplishment, together with <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a> where frankincense as well as gold is mentioned, "they shall bring gold and incense" or frankincense; upon which a noted Jewish writer (d) observes, that gold and frankincense shall be brought privately as a present to the king Messiah. According to the Ethiopians, these wise men were three, whose names they give us; the name of him that offered the gold, was Annoson; he that offered the frankincense, was Allytar; and he that offered the myrrh, Kyssad (e).

The gifts were of three kinds, hence the inference that the Magi were <span class="ital">three</span> in number. That they were <span class="ital">kings</span> was deduced from texts in Psalms and Prophecies (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>), predicting that kings would come doing homage and bringing gifts to Messiah. The legend of the three kings dates as far back as Origen, and is beautiful but baseless. It grew with time; by-and-by the kings were furnished with names. The legendary spirit loves definiteness. The gifts would be products of the givers’ country, or in high esteem and costly there. Hence the inference drawn by some that the Magi were from Arabia. Thus Grotius: “Myrrha nonnisi in Arabia nascitur, nec thus nisi apud Jabaeos Arabum portionem: sed et aurifera est felix Arabia”. Gold and incense (<span class="greekheb">λίβανος</span>) are mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a> among the gifts to be brought to Israel in the good time coming. The fathers delighted in assigning to these gifts of the Magi mystic meanings: gold as to a king, incense as to God, myrrh as to one destined to die (<span class="greekheb">ὡς μέλλοντι γεύσασθαι θανάτου</span>). Grotius struck into a new line: gold = works of mercy; incense = prayer; myrrh = purity—to the disgust of Fritzsche, who thought such mystic interpretations beneath so great a scholar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">the house</span>] St Matthew gives no hint that “the house” was an inn, or that the babe was lying in a manger. Perhaps here as in other places we are misled by the ideas suggested by great pictures; and in truth the visit of the Magi should be placed at least some days after the events recorded in <a href="/context/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed....">Luke 2:1-38</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their treasures</span>] Properly caskets or chests in which treasures were placed. Such offerings to kings were quite in accordance with Eastern usage. Seneca says “No one may salute a Parthian king without bringing a gift;” cp. <a href="/psalms/68-29.htm" title="Because of your temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to you.">Psalm 68:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">frankincense and myrrh</span> were products of Arabia, and, according to Herodotus, of that country only. They were both used for medicinal purposes and for embalming; cp. <a href="/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/2-11.htm" title="And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.">Matthew 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἶδον</span>, <span class="ital">they saw</span>) Sweetly is expressed the increase and progress of their joy from that of seeing the star to that of seeing the KING Himself. The inferior reading, <span class="greekheb">εὗρον</span>[94] (<span class="ital">they found</span>), corresponds with the words of Herod, “Enquire diligently, and when ye have <span class="ital">found</span>,” etc. But the star, by becoming <span class="ital">stationary</span>, spared the Magi the labour of enquiring. They did not so much <span class="ital">find</span> as <span class="ital">see</span>. Cf. <a href="/luke/2-17.htm" title="And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.">Luke 2:17</a>; <a href="/luke/2-20.htm" title="And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.">Luke 2:20</a>; <a href="/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="/luke/2-30.htm" title="For my eyes have seen your salvation,">Luke 2:30</a>.—<span class="greekheb">προσεκύνησαν Αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">they worshipped Him</span>) Mary was not an object of worship to the Magi. If she had been conceived without sin, as the greater portion of the Roman Church has now decided, why should she not then have been worshipped as well as now? for she was then already the Mother of the King, who was to be worshipped.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς θησαυροὺς αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">their treasures</span>) or <span class="ital">receptacles of treasures</span>. The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">אוצר</span>, which is rendered by the LXX. <span class="greekheb">θησαυρὸς</span>; in <a href="/proverbs/8-21.htm" title="That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.">Proverbs 8:21</a>, etc., signifies a storehouse, a repository, even a portable chest or casket.—<span class="greekheb">προσήνεγκαν</span>, <span class="ital">they offered</span>) as to a King.

There was a prediction concerning gold and frankincense in <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>.
