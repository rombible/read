Some might yield before the energy of a human will, and the power of the divine Name, and the prayers even of a weak faith. Some, like that which comes before us here, required a greater intensity of the spiritual life, to be gained by the “prayer and fasting” of which our Lord speaks. The circumstances of the case render it probable that our Lord himself had vouchsafed to fulfil both the conditions. The disciples, we know, did not as yet fast (<a href="/context/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14-15</a>), and the facts imply that they had been weak and remiss in prayer. The words are noticeable as testifying to the real ground and motive for “fasting,” and to the gain for the higher life to be obtained, when it was accompanied by true prayer, by this act of conquest over the lower nature. So St. Peter’s vision (<a href="/context/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9-10</a>), and the appointment of Paul and Barnabas by the direct guidance of the Spirit (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>), are both connected with fasting. And St. Paul, besides the “hunger and thirst” that came upon him as the incidents of his mission-work, speaks of himself as “in fastings often” (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2Corinthians 11:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">This kind </span>— Of devils, <span class="ital">goeth not out but by prayer and fasting</span> — Joined with an eminent degree of the faith he had been describing. He intended by this to excite them to intercede with God for his more abundant co-operation; and by such extraordinary devotions to endeavour to prepare their souls for his further influences. What a testimony have we here of the efficacy of fasting, when added to fervent prayer!

Christ cured the child. Though the people were perverse, and Christ was provoked, yet care was taken of the child. When all other helps and succours fail, we are welcome to Christ, may trust in him, and in his power and goodness. See here an emblem of Christ's undertaking as our Redeemer. It encourages parents to bring children to Christ, whose souls are under Satan's power; he is able to heal them, and as willing as he is able. Not only bring them to Christ by prayer, but bring them to the word of Christ; to means by which Satan's strong-holds in the soul are beaten down. It is good for us to distrust ourselves and our own strength; but it is displeasing to Christ when we distrust any power derived from him, or granted by him. There was also something in the malady which rendered the cure difficult. The extraordinary power of Satan must not discourage our faith, but quicken us to more earnestness in praying to God for the increase of it. Do we wonder to see Satan's bodily possession of this young man from a child, when we see his spiritual possession of every son of Adam from the fall!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit, this kind ... - This kind means this kind of devils - this species of possession.

Mark repeats only what we have here <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/17-19.htm" title="Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?">Matthew 17:19</a>,21</span>. The reason assigned here by our Saviour why his disciples could not cast out this devil, was their unbelief; not their total want, but the weakness of their faith. Christ here again lets us see the power of faith, and the mischief of unbelief. I take the plain sense of the text to be this, That there is nothing which may tend to the glory of God, or to our good, but may be obtained of God by a firm exercise of faith in him. Whether our Saviour here speaketh of a faith of miracles, or no, I will not determine; I rather think that he speaketh here of any true faith: we must have the power and promise of God for its object. The promise of working miracles by a Divine power committed to them, was a particular promise made to the disciples, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/10-1.htm" title="And when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease....">Matthew 10:1-42</a></span>, and so was only the object of their faith. But I take our Saviour’s words to extend to a further latitude, though, as to miraculous operations, it was only applicable to them. There is nothing which God hath promised to give or bestow on any but faith will obtain from him, if attended by a fervent prayer, to which fasting is subservient, as preparing us to it. There are some things which are obtained by a stronger faith, and by more fervent and importunate prayers, than others are. A mercy sometimes seem to us to come out of the hand of God with more difficulty, and wrestling for it; but there is nothing within the latitude of a promise, but is to be done and obtained by the vigorous exercise of faith, and by fervent and importunate prayer. The apostles had yet but a weak and imperfect faith, and they had not used such fervent and importunate prayer in this case as they ought to have done; thence did this work appear so difficult unto them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Howbeit, this kind goeth not out,.... The Vulgate Latin renders it, "is not cast out"; and so do the Arabic version, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel; and which confirm the more commonly received sense of these words, that they are to be understood of that kind of devils, one of which was cast out of the lunatic, and was of the worst sort, of a fierce and obstinate kind; and having had long possession, was not easily ejected: and that there is a difference in devils, some are worse and more wicked than others, is clear from <a href="/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a> and not of that kind of miracles, or kind of faith to the working of such miracles. Moreover, the above versions, as they fitly express the word  here used; see <a href="/mark/9-17.htm">Mark 9:17</a> compared with <a href="/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17</a>. So they pertinently set forth the dispossession of devils, who do not go out voluntarily, but by force; and this sort could not be ejected, <p>but by fasting and prayer: that is, in the exercise of a miraculous faith, expressed in solemn prayer to God, joined with fasting. It seems that Christ not only suggests, that faith was greatly wanting in his disciples; for which reason they could not cast out the devil, and heal the lunatic; but they had been wanting in prayer to God, to assist them in the exercise of their miraculous gifts; and that whilst Christ, and the other three disciples were on the mount, they had been feasting and indulging themselves with the people, and so were in a very undue disposition of mind, for such extraordinary service, for which our Lord tacitly rebukes them. This agrees with the notions of the Jews, who think that, by fasting, a divine soul (f)  , "may obtain that which is sought for"; and that among other things, for which a private person may afflict himself with fasting, this is one,  , "because of an evil spirit" (g); which they think may be got rid of this way. <p>(f) Jacchiades in Dan. x. 3.((g) T.

You have neglected the spiritual preparation that is necessary to the attainment of so lofty a faith. Comp. <a href="/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>. Prayer and fasting are here represented as means for promoting faith, not <span class="ital">as good works</span>, which are <span class="ital">of</span> <span class="ital">themselves effectual</span> in dealing with the demons (Schegg and the older Catholics).

Zigabenus are of opinion that they are demanded not merely from the <span class="ital">healer</span>, but <span class="ital">also from the patient</span>, as necessary weapons to be used against the demon.

Moreover, the somewhat more circumstantial account of Mark is of a stamp so peculiar, is so clear and full of meaning, that it is not to be regarded as a later amplification, but the account in Matthew (and Luke) is rather to be looked upon as an abridgment of the former.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a>. <span class="ital">ide</span> on <a href="/mark/9-29.htm" title="And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.">Mark 9:29</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting</span>] Those only whose own spiritual life and faith are made strong by self-denial and by communion with God in prayer are able to cast forth this kind of evil spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/17.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο δὲ τὸ γένος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">but this kind</span>, etc.) Our Lord does not in this passage speak of the <span class="ital">whole</span> race of devils, but of this particular kind or class of them; from whence it appears that there are more than one kind of devils. The disciples had before this cast out devils even without prayer and fasting;[795] but this kind of devils has a disposition especially opposed to, and reducible by, prayer and fasting. The disciples were not accustomed to fasting (see ch. <a href="/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>); and they appear to have been somewhat sell-indulgent (sobrietatem … minus servare) during their Lord’s absence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[795] Since by [prayers and] fastings faith is increased.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse is omitted in many good manuscripts and by the Revised Version, it being considered to have been introduced from the parallel passage of St. Mark.

But the latter interpretation is excluded by the fact that the apostles had already exercised successfully their power over devils without special prayer or fasting. The words point to a truth in the spiritual world, that there are different degrees in the Satanic hierarchy (comp. <a href="/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>); some demons are more malignant than others, and have greater power over the souls of men. In the present case the possession was of long standing; it revolved a terrible bodily malady; it was of an intense and unusual character. The mere word of exorcism, or the name of Jesus, spoken with little spiritual faith, could net overcome the mighty enemy. The exorcist needed special preparation; he must inspire and augment his faith by prayer and self-discipline. Prayer invokes the aid of God, and puts one's self unreservedly in his hands; fasting subdues the flesh, arouses the soul's energies, brings into exercise the higher parts of man's nature. Thus equipped, a man is open to receive power from on high, and can quell the assaults of the evil one. </body></html>
