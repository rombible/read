He adds the profoundly significant fact that this was while He was in the act of prayer. It was in that act of communion with His Father that the divine glory flowed out into visible brightness. Transcendent as the manifestation was, it has its lower analogies in the radiance which made the face of Stephen “as the face of an angel” (<a href="/acts/6-15.htm" title="And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.">Acts 6:15</a>); yet more in the glory which shone on the face of Moses when he came down from the mount (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29</a>); in some faint measure, in what may be called the metamorphic power of prayer which invests features that have no form or comeliness with the rapture of devout ecstacy. And it is no over-bold speculation to see in the fact thus noted that which gives its meaning to the Transfiguration as a stage in the training of the disciples. Prayers like those which were offered for Peter that his “faith might not fail” (<a href="/context/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31-32</a>) at least suggest something as to the intercession of the Master for His disciples, and this, we must remember, was a crisis in their spiritual history. They had risen to the highest faith; they had been offended by the announcement of His rejection, His sufferings, His death. Something was needed which might sustain their faith, on which they might look back in after years as the earnest of a future glory. It was well for them that they should, at least once in His life of lowliness, gaze on the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and feel that they were not “following cunningly-devised fables,” but had been “eye-witnesses of His majesty” (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>). To those who believe that our Lord’s human nature was in very deed, sin only excepted, like unto ours, it will not seem over-bold to suggest that for Him too this might have been a time of conflict and of trial, a renewal of the Temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23</a>), an anticipation of that of the agony of Gethsemane, and that even for Him, in his humanity, there might be in the excellent glory and in the voice from heaven the help and comfort which strengthened Him for the cross and passion. Following the narrative in its details, we may trace its several stages in some such sequence as follows:—After six days, spent apparently with their Lord in the mountain district near Cæsarea Philippi, but not in the work of preaching or working miracles, the rest of the disciples are left at the foot of the mountain, and the three follow Him, as the evening closes, to its summit. There, as afterwards in Gethsemane, He withdraws from them “about a stone’s throw” (<a href="/luke/22-41.htm" title="And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,">Luke 22:41</a>), and they “watch with Him.” and gaze on Him, as He, standing or kneeling (the first was, we must remember, the more common attitude of prayer, <a href="/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>), intercedes for them and for Israel, and, we may add, for mankind. And then, as they gaze, form and features shine with a new glory, bright as the sun, as though the Shechinah cloud had wrapt Him round. Even His garments are “white as the light,” “white as snow” (the reading in St. Mark is doubtful, but if genuine the snows of Hermon may have suggested the comparison), as St. Mark adds with his usual descriptive vividness, “so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.” Nothing, however, it may be added, suggests the vision of three forms floating in the air with which Raffaelle’s glorious picture has made us familiar.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-13 Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the only begotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, when they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And was transfigured before them - The word "transfigure" means to change the appearance or form. It does not denote the change of the substance of a thing, but simply of its appearance. It puts on a new aspect. What this change was we are expressly told.<p>1. His face shone as the sun; that is, with a special brightness. A similar appearance is described respecting Moses when he came down from the mount, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>. See also <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where Christ is called the brightness of the glory of God: in the original, the splendor or shining, like the brightness of the sun.<p>2. The second change was that of his garments. They were white as the light. Mark says, "exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth could white them." The word "fuller" means, commonly, one who dresses cloth or fulls it, so as to make it more thick and strong. Here it means one who bleaches cloth or makes it white; one who cleanses garments when by wearing they become soiled. Among the Greeks that was a distinct trade. Luke says, "white and glistering," that is, resplendent, shining, or a very bright white. There is no evidence here that what is commonly said of him is true, that his body was so changed as to show what his glorified body is. His body, so far as the sacred writers inform us, underwent no change. All this splendor and glory was a change in appearance only. The Scriptures should be taken just as they are, without any attempt to affix a meaning to them which the sacred writers did not intend.<p>Raiment - Clothing.

This, as to his person, lay in the change of his countenance, looking gloriously as the sun, and his raiment looking extraordinarily white. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And was transfigured before them,.... Peter, James, and John, before whom he was metamorphosed, or changed into another form; for not the substance of his body was changed, nor even the shape of it altered, only it received a more glorious form; that whereas before he appeared in the form of a servant, and looked mean and despicable, now he appeared in the form and majesty of God; or there was a divine glory; which from his deity showed itself in a visible manner through his flesh: <p>and his face did shine as the sun it had still the same appearance of an human face, but had such a dazzling glory upon it, as equalled the sun shining in its full strength: <p>and his raiment was white as the light: he did not put off his clothes, nor were the nature and substance, and fashion of them changed; but such rays of glory darted through his flesh, and through his clothes, as made them as bright and shining, as the light of the sun at noon day. Mark says, they became "exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can white them". The Vulgate Latin reads, "as snow", here; and so do the Ethiopic version, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel. Snow has a peculiar whiteness in it, and is therefore made use of, to express the glittering brightness of Christ's raiment; and the fuller is mentioned, who by the Jews (a) is called  and means one that whitens wool, or raiment, and such an one is here designed: not that any fuller makes garments of another colour white; for though this may be done, it is not the work of fullers, but dyers: but fullers, whatever colour garments are of, if sullied and spotted, can restore them to their native colour; and if white, can bring them to their former whiteness: now Christ's garments were as white, yea, whiter, than any such men could possibly make garments, that were white at first: what colour Christ's garments were of before, is not certain; now they appeared white, to the greatest degree of whiteness. Dr. Hammond (b) has a conjecture, that in the phrase "on earth", reference is had to the earth fullers make use of in cleaning, and which is called "fullers' earth"; and that the words are to be rendered, "as no fuller, by or with earth can white them"; but if this will not bear, the sense is, that there is no fuller, nor ever was, or ever will be upon earth, that can make raiment so white as Christ's was. <p>(a) Maimon. in Misn.

The verb is used in classical Greek of transformation, as of a man into an animal. Here it refers to a change of countenance, which is the chief index of any change exterior or interior. St. Luke explains the matter with the words, "The fashion of his countenance was altered." The Word of God allows for a brief space his essential glory to irradiate and shine through the form of a servant which he wore. Not that he showed his Divine nature, or laid aside his human body; his bodily nature remained in its entirety, but permeating it was an effulgence which indicated the Godhead. Perhaps it might be said, as an old writer puts it, that the Transfiguration was less a new miracle than the temporary cessation of an habitual miracle; for the veiling of his glory was the real marvel, the Divine restraint which prohibited the illumination of his sacred humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Before them.</span> In their presence. Jesus probably had withdrawn in order to pray in secret, but returned to the waiting three, that they might behold his glory - be "eyewitnesses of his majesty," as St. Peter says (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>). These, indeed, had been heavy with sleep (Luke), but had awoke at his appearance, and beheld the vision in full possession of their senses. St. Matthew mentions specially two points in this transfiguration. <span class="cmt_word">His face did shine as the sun.</span> This recalls the appearance of the Son of man in <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." <span class="cmt_word">And his raiment was white as the light.</span> The light which emanated from his body shone through and glorified his very garments. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">sicut nix</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> is read in some few manuscripts in place of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>: but the word is doubtless introduced here from St. Mark (where, however, it is of doubtful genuineness). If this second evangelist received his account from St. Peter, we recognize the simile in the apostle's remembrance of the snow clad peak of Hermon, in whose vicinity the event transpired. No candid reader can fail to acknowledge that it is no subjective vision that is here narrated, no merely inward impression on brain or nerve with nothing external to correspond, but a real, objective occurrence, which was beheld by mortal eyes endued with no supernatural or abnormal powers, except in so far as they were enabled to look on this partial emanation of the Divine effulgence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He was transfigured (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, denoting change or transfer, and &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;, form. This latter word denotes the form regarded as the distinctive nature and character of the object, and is distinguished from &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, the changeable, outward fashion: in a man, for instance, his gestures, clothes, words, acts. The &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; partakes of the essence of a thing; the &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; is an accident which may change, leaving the form unaffected. Compare <a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>; Christ "appeared in another form" (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;), and <a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a> : "the fashion (&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) of the world passeth away." The distinction passes into the verbs compounded with these two nouns. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, "Be not conformed to this world," is &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;; i.e., be not fashioned according to the fleeting fashion of this world. So Rev., fashioned. See, also, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>, where the changes described are changes in outward semblance. False apostles appeared in the outward fashion of apostles of Christ; Satan takes on the outward appearance of an angel. All these changes are in the accidents of the life, and do not touch its inner, essential quality. On the other hand, a change in the inner life is described as a change of &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;, never of &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. Hence, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, "Be ye transformed (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;); the change taking place by the renewing of the mind. Compare <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; and see, further, on <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>.<p>Why, then, it may be asked, is a compound of &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; employed in this description of the transfigured Saviour, since the change described is a change in his outward appearance? It may be answered, because a compound of &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, expressing merely a change in the aspect of Christ's person and garments, would not express the deeper truth of the case, which is, that the visible change gets its real character and meaning from that which is essential in our Lord - his divine nature. A fore-shadowing or prophecy of his true form - his distinctive character - comes out in his transfiguration. He passes over into a form identified, so far as revealed, with the divine quality of his being, and prophetic of his revelation "as he is" (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), in the glory which he had with the Father before the world was (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). In truth, there is a deep and pregnant hint in the use of this word, which easily escapes observation, and which defies accurate definition. The profound and overwhelming impression upon the three disciples was due to something besides the shining of Christ's face and garments, and the presence of Moses and Elijah; and was deeper and subtler than the effect of all these combined. There was a fact and a power in that vision which mere radiance and the appearance of the dead patriarchs could not wholly convey: a revelation of Deity breaking out in that glorified face and form, which appealed to something deeper than sense, and confirmed the words from heaven: This is my beloved Son.<p>The same truth is illustrated in the use of &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>, where it is said that Jesus appeared in a different form (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;) after his resurrection. The accidents of figure, face, pierced hands and feet, were the same; but an indefinable change had passed upon him, the characteristic of which was that it prefigured his passing into the condition peculiar and appropriate to his essential spiritual and divine being. </body></html>
