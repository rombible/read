It was intended to support their faith, when they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Elias is come already - That is, John the Baptist has come, in the spirit and power of Elias.

( = Mr 9:2-13; Lu 9:28-36).<p>For the exposition, see on [1321]Lu 9:28-36.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 11-13. Mark saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/9-12.htm" title="And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.">Mark 9:12</a></span>, <span class="ital">He answered and told them, Elias verily comes first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</span> Our Saviour agreeth to the promise, but showeth their mistake as to the true sense of it. They understood the promise of Elijah the Tishbite: the promise referred only to one of his spirit, and such a one was come, that was John the Baptist, as the angel told Zacharias, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a></span>, <span class="ital">He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias.</span> Very much of the power and spirit of Elijah was evident in John. Elijah was full of zeal for God, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1 Kings 19:10</a></span>: so was John the Baptist. Did Elijah freely reprove, not only Baal’s priests, but even Ahab and Jezebel? John as freely reproved Herod and Herodias, and the Pharisees and Sadducees. Was Elijah an austere man? Such was John the Baptist. Did Elijah flee unto the wilderness to save his life? John Baptist, for some time, lived and preached there. Elijah living in a corrupt time, was a great means or instrument to restore decayed religion: so was John the Baptist, in the time wherein he lived. This notwithstanding, not the Jews only, but some Christians, and that not only papists, but some protestants, think, that besides the Elias which is long since come, there is another Elias, who shall come before the end of the world. They found their opinion upon this text in a great measure, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because our Saviour here saith, ercetai prwton, he doth come first; and Mark saith, elywn prwton, apokayista, <span class="ital">coming first, restoreth all things.</span> Now John the Baptist was both come and gone; nor had he restored all things. Besides, they say, that John denied himself to be Elias, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a></span>; and it is plain, that not the scribes and Pharisees, but the disciples, only understood the prophecy of Elijah the Tishbite; and Malachi saith, that Elijah should come before <span class="ital">the terrible day of the Lord, </span> which day, they say, is the day of judgment, in the constant language of Scripture. But to all this is answered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) That the Baptist, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a></span>, only denied himself to be that Elias about which they inquired, according to their tradition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) That it is true, that the disciples were led away with the Jewish tradition, and looked for Elijah the Tishbite, but Christ both here and elsewhere correcteth their error. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c) That not only the day of general judgment is called the terrible day of the Lord, but the gospel time, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-10.htm" title="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a></span>, when the axe was laid to the root of the tree, &c.; so <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/2-20.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:">Acts 2:20</a></span>; and the day of the Jews’ particular judgment, which some understand hinted in those texts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>d) That our Lord first repeateth the words of Malachi, and so he saith, Elias shall come, or is coming; and then he expounds the words of Malachi of John the Baptist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>e) That the words of <span class="bld"><a href="/malachi/4-6.htm" title="And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.">Malachi 4:6</a></span> are expounded by the angel, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/1-16.htm" title="And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.">Luke 1:16</a>,17</span>, and there applied to John the Baptist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>f) That John did fulfil the words of the prophet, by endeavouring the conversion of the Jews, and prevailing in a great measure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>g) That the last words in Malachi, <span class="ital">lest I smite the earth with a curse, </span> plainly show that the text in Malachi cannot be understood of the day of judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And though the name of Elias be given to John, yet it is no more than the giving the name of David to the Messias, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a></span>. So as there is no other Elijah to be expected, but the Elijah prophesied of by Malachi was (as our Saviour doth expound it) John the Baptist, whom Herod had beheaded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They knew him not, </span> their tradition blinded them so as they could not discern the prophecy of Malachi fulfilled in him, so did unto him <span class="ital">whatsoever they listed; </span> and, saith our Saviour, so shall they do with the Son of man, that is, with me, who am the Son of man. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the disciples understood,....

Indeed, it was something quite new that they should thus at once apprehend Christ's meaning, so slow were they of faith, so unintelligent  in appreciating the full signification of their Master's instructions. </body></html>
