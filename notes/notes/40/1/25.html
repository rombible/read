What bearing have these words on the widespread belief of Christendom in the perpetual maidenhood of Mary? On what grounds does that belief itself rest?<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God entered into this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours of this world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knew her not - The doctrine of the virginity of Mary before the birth of Jesus is a doctrine of the Scriptures, and is very important to be believed. But the Bible does not affirm that she had no children afterward. Indeed, all the accounts in the New Testament lead us to suppose that she did have them. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55-56</a>. The language here evidently implies that she lived as the wife of Joseph after the birth of Jesus.<p>Her first-born son - Her oldest son, or the one who had the privilege of birthright by the law.

(See on [1205]Mt 13:55, 56).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 24,25.

Some of the ancients were stiff in their opinion that he did not, so are the popish writers, and many protestant interpreters. Mr. Calvin I think determines best, that none will move such a question, but such as are unwarrantably curious; nor contend for either part, but such as are unreasonably quarrelsome. For as, on the one side, none can conclude that she had more children from the word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">till, </span> further than they can conclude, from <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a></span>, that Christ shall not for ever sit at his Father’s right hand, (the word <span class="ital">until</span> being a particle only exclusive of a preceding time, not affirming the thing in future time), nor doth the term <span class="ital">firstborn</span> conclude any born afterward; so, on the other side, there are no cogent arguments to prove that Mary had no more children by Joseph. We read of the brother of our Lord, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a></span>, and of his mother and his "brethren," <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/12-47.htm" title="Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.">Matthew 12:47</a></span>; and though it be true <span class="ital">brethren</span> may signify kinsmen, according to the Hebrew dialect, yet that it doth so in these texts cannot be proved. The Holy Ghost had made use of the virgin for the production of the Messias; why after this her womb should be shut up, and Joseph take her home to be his wife, and not use her as such I cannot tell, nor yet what reproach it could be to Mary or to our Saviour, marriage being God’s ordinance, and the undefiled bed honourable: and those who think our Saviour would have been dishonoured in any others lying in the same bed after him, seem to forget how much he humbled himself in lying in that bed first, and then in a stable and a manger. We know he knew her not till Christ was born, whether he did afterward or no we are willingly ignorant because God hath not told us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And he called his name Jesus:</span> this is added to declare his obedience to the command received by the angel.

Or "but he knew her not", answering to the Hebrew that is, had carnal knowledge of her, or copulation with her, though his wife. The words are an euphemism, or a modest way of expressing the conjugal act, and is a very ancient one, see <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a> and what has been used in nations and languages. And this conduct of his was necessary, <p>till she had brought forth her firstborn; that it might be manifest not only that she conceived, being a virgin, but also that she brought forth, being a virgin: for both are signified in the prophecy before related, "a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son"; which is all one as if it had been said, a virgin shall conceive, and "a virgin" shall bring forth a son. The "firstborn" is that which first opens the womb of its mother, whether any follows after or not, <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>. Christ is called Mary's firstborn, because she had none before him, whether she had any after him or not; for her perpetual virginity seems to be no necessary article of faith: for when it is said, <p>Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth, the meaning is certain that he knew her not before. But whether he afterwards did or not, is not so manifest, nor is it a matter of any great importance; the word "until" may be so understood as referring to the time preceding, that the contrary cannot be affirmed of the time following, <a href="/2_samuel/6-23.htm">2 Samuel 6:23</a> and which may be the case here, and is indeed generally understood so; and it also may be considered as only expressive of the intermediate time, as in <a href="/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a> as Beza observes. Christ was "her firstborn" as he was man, and the firstborn of God, or his first and only begotten, as the Son of God. It is further observed, that she "called his name Jesus", as was foretold to her, or ordered her by the Angel, <a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a> and to Joseph, <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And knew her not <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</span><p>(l) The word till, in the Hebrew language, gives us to understand that a thing will not come to pass in time to come: as Michal had no children till her death day, 2Sa 6:23.

Since Epiphanius, Jerome, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, very many expositors have maintained, with a view to support the perpetual virginity of Mary, but in opposition to the straightforward and impartial character of the narrative, that Joseph, even after the birth of Jesus, had no sexual intercourse with Mary.[365]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But (1) from <span class="greekheb">ἕως οὗ</span> of itself no inference can be drawn either in <span class="ital">favour of</span> or <span class="ital">against</span> such a view, as in all statements with “<span class="ital">until</span>” the <span class="ital">context</span> alone must decide whether, with regard to that which had not formerly occurred, it is or is not intended to convey that it afterwards took place. But (2) that it is <span class="ital">here</span> conceived as subsequently taking place, is so clear of itself to every unprejudiced reader from the idea of the marriage arrangement, that Matthew <span class="ital">must</span> have <span class="ital">expressed</span> the thought, “<span class="ital">not only until</span>—<span class="ital">but afterwards also he had not</span>,” if such had been his meaning. That he did <span class="ital">not</span>, however, mean this is clearly shown (3) by his use of <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκον</span>, which is neither equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟς ΚΑῚ ΜΌΝΟς</span></span></span> (Theophylact, Euth. Zigabenus), nor does it designate the first-born, <span class="ital">without</span> assuming others born afterwards (so formerly most expositors). The latter meaning is untenable, because the evangelist employed <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκον</span> as an historian, from the standpoint of the time when his Gospel was composed, and consequently could <span class="ital">not</span> have used it had Jesus been present to his historical consciousness as the <span class="ital">only</span> son of Mary. But Jesus, according to Matthew (<a href="/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a> ff., <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a> f.), had also brothers and sisters, amongst whom He was the <span class="ital">firstborn</span>. Lucian’s remark (<span class="ital">Demonax</span>, 29), speaking of Agathocles, is correct: <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὲν πρῶτος</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνος</span>· <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ μόνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ πρῶτος</span>. (4) All <span class="ital">a priori</span> suppositions are untenable, from which the perpetual virginity of Mary is said to appear,—such as that of Euth. Zigabenus: <span class="greekheb">πῶς ἂν ἐπεχείρησεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ καὶ ὅλως ἐνεθυμήθη γνῶναι τὴν συλλαβοῦσαν ἐκ πνεύματος ἁγίου καὶ τοιοῦτον δοχεῖον γεγενημένην</span>; of Olshausen: “it is manifest that Joseph, after such experiences, might with good reason believe that <span class="ital">his</span> marriage with Mary was intended for another purpose than that of begetting children.” Hofmann has the correct meaning (<span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, II. 2, p. 405), so also Thiersch, Wieseler, Bleek, Ewald, Laurent, <span class="ital">neut.

Grotius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[365] As a logical consequence of this supposition, Joseph was made to be a worn-out old man (Thilo, <span class="ital">ad cod. Apocr</span>. I. p. 361; Keim, <span class="ital">Gesch. Jes</span>. I. p. 365), and his children were regarded either as children of a former marriage (Origen, Epiphanius, and many other Fathers), or the brothers of Jesus were transformed into cousins (Jerome). Of any advanced age in the case of Joseph there is no trace in the N. T. In <a href="/john/6-42.htm" title="And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he said, I came down from heaven?">John 6:42</a>, the Jews express themselves in such a way that Joseph might be conceived as still alive at the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">υἱόν</span>: absolute habitual (note the imperfect) abstinence from marital intercourse, the sole purpose of the hastened marriage being to legitimise the child.—<span class="greekheb">ἕως</span>: not till then, and afterwards? Here comes in a <span class="ital">quæstio vexata</span> of theology. Patristic and catholic authors say: not till then and never at all, guarding the sacredness of the virgin’s womb. <span class="greekheb">ἕως</span> does not settle the question.

But the presumption is all the other way in the case before us. Subsequent intercourse was the natural, if not the necessary, course of things. If the evangelist had felt as the Catholics do, he would have taken pains to prevent misunderstanding.—<span class="greekheb">υἱόν</span>: the extended reading (T.

Euthymius quotes in proof <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6</a> : “I am the first, and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God.”—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκάλεσεν</span>, he (not she) called the child Jesus, the statement referring back to the command of the angel to Joseph.

It is sufficient however, that her virginity should be established up to the time of her delivery. With regard to the remainder of her married life, the reader is left to form his own opinion. The angel did not expressly forbid Joseph to have conjugal intercourse with her: but he perceived such a command to be implied by the very nature of the case.—<span class="greekheb">ἓως οὗ ἔτεκε τὸν υἱὸν</span>, <span class="ital">until she brought forth the Son</span>) A very old Egyptian version has only these words, without the addition of “<span class="ital">her first-born</span>:[69] according to which reading, the address of the angel, the declaration of the prophet, and the act of Joseph [in naming Him as the angel directed] are expressed in words which exactly correspond together.—sc., “<span class="ital">She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus,”—“She shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Jesus,”—She brought forth</span> TON <span class="greekheb">Υἱὸν</span>, THE <span class="ital">Son, and he</span> [Joseph][70] <span class="ital">called His name Jesus</span>.

(by which name we suppose the celebrated Vatican MS. to be intended in this place), and we have assured ourselves that beyond doubt such must have been originally that of the Latin Vulgate. For Helvidius,[71] and Jerome in the commencement of his book against him, thus quote the words of St Matthew—<span class="ital">et non cognovit eam, donec peperit filium suum, i.e., and he knew her not till she brought forth her Son</span>; but more commonly they quote thus <span class="ital">donec peperit filium, i.e., until she brought forth</span> ([72] or <span class="ital">the) Son</span>, without the addition of either <span class="ital">suum</span> (<span class="ital">her</span>) or <span class="ital">primogenitum</span> <span class="ital">(first-born)</span>; nor can it be argued, that they have in these instances intended to abridge the text, since Jerome in one place thus quotes the passage in full, “<span class="ital">Exurgens autem—accepit uxorem suam et non cognovit eam, donec peperit filium: et vocavit nomen ejus Jesum,” i.e., But on rising from sleep—he received his wife, and knew her not until she had brought forth</span> [the] <span class="ital">Son: and he called His name Jesus</span>.[73]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[69] The disputed words are found in E.

If the Codex Barberini I., and the Coptic version already mentioned, obtained this reading from Greek MSS., their testimony is on that ground of great weight: if, on the other hand, they obtained it from Latin sources, they greatly corroborate the genuine reading of the very ancient Latin version. The words <span class="greekheb">αὐτῆς τὸν πρωτότοκον</span>, “<span class="ital">her first-born</span>,” appear to have been introduced into St Matthew, from the parallel passage in St Luke already cited: and the very idea of the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of a Virgin</span>, implies that He must have been the first-born in a pre-eminent and strictly singular manner. [Such as He is expressly declared to be in <a href="/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>, <span class="ital">Vers.
