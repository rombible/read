It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him, 2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, &c.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses contain the genealogy of Jesus. Luke also <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> gives a genealogy of the Messiah. No two passages of Scripture have caused more difficulty than these, and various attempts have been made to explain them. There are two sources of difficulty in these catalogues.<p>1. Many names that are found in the Old Testament are here omitted; and,<p>2. The tables of Matthew and Luke appear in many points to be different.<p>From Adam to Abraham Matthew has mentioned no names, and Luke only has given the record. From Abraham to David the two tables are alike. Of course there is no difficulty in reconciling these two parts of the tables. The difficulty lies in that part of the genealogy from David to Christ. There they are entirely different. They are manifestly different lines. Not only are the names different, but Luke has mentioned, in this part of the genealogy, no less than 42 names, while Matthew has recorded only 27 names.<p>Various ways have been proposed to explain this difficulty, but it must be admitted that none of them is perfectly satisfactory. It does not comport with the design of these notes to enter minutely into an explanation of the perplexities of these passages. All that can be done is to suggest the various ways in which attempts have been made to explain them.<p>1. It is remarked that in nothing are mistakes more likely to occur than in such tables. From the similarity of names, and the different names by which the same person is often called, and from many other causes, errors would be more likely to creep into genealogical tables than in other writings. Some of the difficulties may have possibly occurred from this cause.<p>2. Most interpreters have supposed that Matthew gives the genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary. They were both descended from David, but in different lines. This solution derives some plausibility from the fact that the promise was made to David, and as Jesus was not the son of Joseph, it was important to show that Mary was also descended from him. But though this solution is plausible, and may be true, yet it wants evidence. It cannot, however, be proved that this was not the design of Luke.<p>3. It has been said also that Joseph was the legal son and heir of Heli, though the real son of Jacob, and that thus the two lines terminated in him. This was the explanation suggested by most of the Christian fathers, and on the whole is the most satisfactory. It was a law of the Jews that if a man died without children, his brother should marry his widow. Thus the two lines might have been intermingled, According to this solution, which was first proposed by Africanus, Matthan, descended from Solomon, married Estha, of whom was born Jacob. After Matthan's death, Matthat being of the same tribe, but of another family, married his widow, and of this marriage Heli was born. Jacob and Heli were therefore children of the same mother. Heli dying without children, his brother Jacob married his widow, and begat Joseph, who was thus the legal son of Heli. This is agreeable to the account in the two evangelists. Matthew says that Jacob begat Joseph; Luke says that Joseph was the son of Heli, i. e., was his legal heir, or was reckoned in law to be his son. This can be seen by the plan on the next page, showing the nature of the connection.<p>Though these solutions may not seem to be entirely satisfactory, yet there are two additional considerations which should set the matter at rest, and lead to the conclusion that the narratives are not really inconsistent.<p>1. No difficulty was ever found, or alleged, in regard to them, by any of the early enemies of Christianity. There is no evidence that they ever adduced them as containing a contradiction. Many of those enemies were acute, learned, and able; and they show by their writings that they were not indisposed to detect all the errors that could possibly be found in the sacred narrative. Now it is to be remembered that the Jews were fully competent to show that these tables were incorrect, if they were really so; and it is clear that they were fully disposed, if possible, to do it. The fact, therefore, that it is not done, is clear evidence that they thought it to be correct. The same may be said of the acute pagans who wrote against Christianity. None of them have called in question the correctness of these tables. This is full proof that, in a time when it was easy to understand these tables, they were believed to be correct.<p>2. The evangelists are not responsible for the correctness of these tables. They are responsible only for what was their real and professed object to do. What was that object? It was to prove to the satisfaction of the Jews that Jesus was descended from David, and therefore that there was no argument from his ancestry that he was not the promised Messiah. Now to make this out, it was not necessary, nor would it have conduced to their argument, to have formed a new table of genealogy. All that could be done was to go to the family records - to the public tables, and copy them as they were actually kept, and show that, according to the records of the nation, Jesus was descended from David. This, among the Jews, would be full and decided testimony in the case. And this was doubtless done. In the same way, the records of a family among us, as they are kept by the family, are proof in courts of justice now of the birth, names, etc., of individuals. Nor is it necessary or proper for a court to call them in question or to attempt to correct them. So, the tables here are good evidence to the only point that the writers wished to establish: that is, to show to the Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was descended from David. The only inquiry which can now be fairly made is whether they copied those tables correctly. It is clear that no man can prove that they did not so copy them, and therefore that no one can adduce them as an argument against the correctness of the New Testament. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Some think that he was set up instead of Jehoahaz, when he was carried away. But the Scripture saith nothing of it, nor is it very probable that the conqueror should skip over the second and third son, and set up the fourth. But it is not my present concern to inquire after Shallum, but only after Jechonias mentioned in this verse, and the other Jechonias mentioned in <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a></span>, as the head of those generations which make up the last period. As to this Jechonias, the most probable opinion is, that it was Jehoiakim, who was also called Jeconiah, and that the Jechonias mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a></span> was Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim. In this I find some of the best interpreters acquiescing, nor indeed is there any great difficulty in allowing Jehoiakim the father, as well as Jehoiachin the son, to be called Jeconiah (so near are the names akin, and the signification of both the same); but then the question is, how Josiah could be said to <span class="ital">beget Jehoiakim about the time of the carrying into the captivity of Babylon; </span> for it appeareth by <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm" title="Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.">2 Chronicles 36:5</a></span>, that <span class="ital">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years; </span> and in his time was the first carrying into Babylon; so that there must be thirty-seven years betwixt the begetting of Jehoiakim and the first transportation into Babylon. The margin of our Bibles tells us of another reading, <span class="ital">Josias begat Jakim, </span>( Jakim and Jehoiakim are the same), <span class="ital">and Jakim begat Jechonias</span> (that is, Jehoiachin). Beza thinks this the truest reading, taken out of an old copy of R. Stephens, magnified by Stapulensis and Bucer. But he thinks it should be thus, <span class="ital">Josias begat Jakim and his brethren, </span>( for we know that Josiah had four sons), <span class="ital">and Jakim begat Jechonias</span> (that is, Jehoiachin) about the time of the carrying into the captivity o Babylon.

There is an omission here also: Eliakim, son of Josiah and father of Jeconiah. It was noted and made a ground of reproach to Christians by Porphyry. Maldonatus, pressed by the difficulty, proposed to substitute for Jeconiah, Jehoiakim, the second of four sons ascribed to Josiah in the genealogist’s source (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-14.htm" title="Amon his son, Josiah his son.">1 Chronicles 3:14</a>), whereby the expression <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ</span> would retain its natural sense. But, while the two names are perhaps similar enough to be mistaken for each other, it is against the hypothesis as a solution of the difficulty that Jehoiakim did not share in the captivity (<a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm" title="So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 24:6</a>), while the words of <a href="/matthew/1-11.htm" title="And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:">Matthew 1:11</a> seem to imply that the descendant of Josiah referred to was associated with his brethren in exile. The words <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος</span> probably supply the key to the solution. Josiah brings us to the brink of the period of exile. With his name that doleful time comes into the mind of the genealogist. Who is to represent it in the line of succession? Not Jehoiakim, for though the deportation began in his reign he was not himself a captive. It must be Jeconiah (Jehoiakin), his son at the second remove, who was among the captives (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2 Kings 24:15</a>). His “brethren” are his uncles, sons of Josiah, his grandfather; brethren in blood, and brethren also as representatives of a calamitous time—(<span class="ital">vide</span> Weiss-Meyer). There is a pathos in this second allusion to brotherhood. “Judah and his brethren,” partakers in the promise (also in the sojourn in Egypt); “Jeconiah and his brethren,” the generation of the promise eclipsed. Royalty in the dust, but not without hope. The omission of Eliakim (or Jehoiakim) serves the subordinate purpose of keeping the second division of the genealogy within the number fourteen.—<span class="greekheb">Μετοικεσίας</span>: literally <span class="ital">change of abode</span>, deportation, “carrying away,” late Greek for <span class="greekheb">μετοικία</span> or <span class="greekheb">μετοίκησις</span>.—<span class="greekheb">Βαβυλῶνος</span>: genitive, expressing the <span class="ital">terminus ad quem</span> (<span class="ital">vide</span> Winer, § 30, 2 a, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁδὸν θαλάσσης</span>, <a href="/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:">Matthew 10:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁδὸν ἐθνῶν</span>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>., “at the time of, during,” the time being of some length; the process of deportation went on for years. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/mark/2-26.htm" title="How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?">Mark 2:26</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ</span>, under the high priesthood of Abiathar, and <a href="/mark/12-26.htm" title="And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?">Mark 12:26</a> for a similar use of <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> in reference to place: <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου</span>—at the place where the story of the bush occurs. <span class="greekheb">Μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. in <a href="/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a> means <span class="ital">after</span> not <span class="ital">during</span>, as some have supposed, misled by taking <span class="greekheb">μετοικεσία</span> as denoting the state of exile. <span class="ital">Vide</span> on this Fritzsche.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Josias begat Jechonias</span> (Jehoiakim)] but in the next <span class="ital">v.</span> Jechonias = Jehoiachin.

Some have sought for <span class="ital">Jehoiachim</span> in St Matthew’s first mention of Jechoniah; Jerome[12] has done so especially, when answering Porphyry’s[13] objections to this verse on the ground of the hiatus. No transformation, however, will produce Jechoniah (in the LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἸΕΧΟΝΊΑς</span>) from the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">יהויקים</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἸΩΑΚΕῖΜ</span> (Joakim) of the LXX., so as to make them one and the same name: nor have we any more reason for supposing that Jehoiachim and Jechoniah are intended by the repetition of the former, than that two separate individuals are intended by the repetition of Isaac’s name; and so on with the other names in the genealogy. The same Jechoniah is twice introduced under his own name: he was descended from Josiah through Jehoiachim, whose name is omitted. St Matthew calls Jechoniah’s uncles his <span class="ital">brothers</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/13-8.htm" title="And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.">Genesis 13:8</a>), and that with great felicity; for <span class="ital">Zedekiah</span> came to the throne after the commencement of the captivity, to the exclusion of the sons of Jechoniah, whom he succeeded, and who, though his nephew, was born eight years before him.

Here we come upon another omission. Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim, and he the father of Jechoniah (called also Jehoiachin); see <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>. The omission is supplied in some few manuscripts; but it may be only the case of a marginal note in a previous copy having found its way into the text. There is, however, something to be said in favour of its acceptance. The similarity between the names Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin is very great, especially in some of the Greek forms, so that they might easily be confused, and thus a verse be omitted in some very early text. Then Jehoiachin (Jechonias) apparently had no brethren (but see <a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a>), whereas Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, had two or three (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>). To make the whole pedigree agree with the Old Testament records some addition in this form would appear necessary; <span class="accented">Josiah begat</span> [<span class="accented">Jehoiakim and his brethren</span>, <span class="accented">and Jehoiakim begat</span>] <span class="accented">Jechoniah about the time</span>, etc. But manuscript evidence for this is extremely slight ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.,' i,). Yet the supposition that the name of Jehoiakim has been omitted removes what has seemed to many another difficulty. As the list now stands, to make up the fourteen in the third as well as in the second section of the genealogy it is necessary to count Jehoiachin - a king whose reign lasted only three mouths (<a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>) - twice over. He closes the second fourteen and begins the third. There is nothing like this found at the other division. To substitute Jehoiakim after Josiah would avoid this repetition of the name of such a very insignificant person, especially as the reign of Jehoiakim lasted eleven years (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). And to mention Jehoiakim as the father of Jehoiachin "at the time of the carrying away to Babylon" would be very appropriate, whereas to say Josiah begat his children at that date is not so strictly correct. It seems, then, probable that we have here some clerical error, which may have existed already in the list which St. Matthew used. About the time. The preposition in the Greek means rather, "<span class="accented">at</span> the time." The Authorized Version, however, gives the sense, for the birth of Jehoiachin must have been some years before the commencement of the Babylonish conquest, which may be said to have begun with Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of the land in Jehoiakim's days (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). </body></html>
