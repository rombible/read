And it is high honour to the greatest rulers to attend on the Lord Jesus; and those who would receive mercy from Christ, must honour him. The variety of methods Christ took in working his miracles, perhaps was because of the different frames and tempers of mind, which those were in who came to him, and which He who searches the heart perfectly knew. A poor woman applied herself to Christ, and received mercy from him by the way. If we do but touch, as it were, the hem of Christ's garment by living faith, our worst evils will be healed; there is no other real cure, nor need we fear his knowing things which are a grief and burden to us, but which we would not tell to any earthly friend. When Christ entered the ruler's house, he said, Give place. Sometimes, when the sorrow of the world prevails, it is difficult for Christ and his comforts to enter. The ruler's daughter was really dead, but not so to Christ. The death of the righteous is in a special manner to be looked on as only a sleep. The words and works of Christ may not at first be understood, yet they are not therefore to be despised. The people were put forth. Scorners who laugh at what they do not understand, are not proper witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ. Dead souls are not raised to spiritual life, unless Christ take them by the hand: it is done in the day of his power. If this single instance of Christ's raising one newly dead so increased his fame, what will be his glory when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The account contained in these verses is also recorded, with some additional circumstances, in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22-43</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41-56</a>.<p><a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a><p>There came a certain ruler - Mark and Luke say that his name was Jairus, and that he was a "ruler of the synagogue;" that is, one of the elders to whom was committed the care of the synagogue.<p>See the notes at <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>.<p>And worshipped him - That is, fell down before him, or expressed his respect for him by a token of profound regard. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2</a>.<p>My daughter is even now dead - Luke says that this was his only daughter, and that she was twelve years of age. Mark and Luke say that she was "at the point of death," and that information of her actual death was brought to him by one who was sent by the ruler of the synagogue, while Jesus was going. Matthew combined the two facts, and stated the representation which was made to Jesus, without stopping particularly to exhibit the manner in which it was done. In a summary way he says that the ruler communicated the information. Luke and Mark, dwelling more particularly on the circumstances, state at length the way in which it was done; that is, by himself stating, in a hurry, that she was "about to die," or "was dying," and then in a few moments sending word that "she was dead." The Greek word, rendered "is even now dead," does not of necessity mean, as our translation would express, that she had actually expired, but only that she was "dying" or about to die. Compare <a href="/genesis/48-21.htm">Genesis 48:21</a>. It is likely that a father, in these circumstances, would use a word as nearly expressing actual death as would be consistent with the fact that she was alive. The passage may be expressed thus: "My daughter was so sick that she must be by this time dead."<p>Come and lay thy hand upon her - It was customary for the Jewish prophets, in conferring favors, to lay their hand on the person benefited. Jesus had probably done so also, and the ruler had probably witnessed the fact.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 9:18-26.

Two evangelists say she was at the point of death, or dying: Matthew saith that he said she was dead; that might be according to his apprehension; she was so near death, that he concluded that by that time he was got to Christ she was dead. Others observe out of Greek authors, that the particle arti, here used, doth not always signify a time past, but sometimes a time near at hand. But the best answer is, that Matthew relates the story compendiously. It appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/8-49.htm" title="While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.">Luke 8:49</a></span>, that the maid did die.

Immediately, without delay, or any more ado: he did not upbraid him with the treatment he and his followers met with, from men of his profession; who cast out of their synagogues such, who confessed him to be the Messiah: nor does he take notice of any weakness in his faith; as that he thought it necessary he should go with him to his house, when he could as well have restored his daughter to life, absent, as present; and that he should prescribe a form of doing it, by laying his hands upon her. These things he overlooked, and at once got up from Matthew's table, and went along with him, <p>and so did his disciples, to be witnesses of the miracle; and according to the other evangelists, a large multitude of people besides; even a throng of them, led by curiosity to see this wondrous performance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/9-19.htm" title="And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.">Matthew 9:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγερθεὶς</span> apparently refers back to <a href="/matthew/9-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.">Matthew 9:10</a>, implying close sequence—feasting, fasting, dying; such is life indeed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus arose</span>, Matthew only.
