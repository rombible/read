The wedding-feast suggested the idea of the wedding-garment, and of the wine which belonged to its joy. We may even go a step further, and believe that the very dress of those who sat at meat in Matthew’s house, coming as they did from the lower and less decently-habited classes, made the illustration all the more palpable and vivid. How could those worn garments be made meet for wedding-guests? Would it be enough to sew on a patch of new cloth where the old was wearing into holes? Not so He answers here; not so He answers again when He implicitly makes the king who gives the feast the giver also of the garment (<a href="/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2</a>);<p><span class= "bld">New cloth</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> cloth that has not passed through the fuller’s hands—new and undressed, in its freshest and strongest state.

The “garment” is that which is outward, the life and conversation of the man, which show his character. The old garment is the common life of sinful men, such as Matthew and his guests; the new garment is the life of holiness, the religious life in its completeness; fasting, as one element of that life, is the patch of new cloth which agrees not with the old, and leads to a greater evil, a “worse rent” in the life than before. No one would so deal with the literal garment. Yet this was what the Pharisees and the disciples of John were wishing to do with the half-converted publicans. This, we may add, is what the Church of Christ has too often done in her work as the converter of the nations. Sacramental ordinances or monastic vows, or Puritan formulæ, or Quaker conventionalities, have been engrafted on lives that were radically barbarous, or heathen, or worldly, and the contrast has been glaring, and the “rent” made worse. The more excellent way, which our Lord pursued, and which it is our wisdom to pursue, is to take the old garment, and to transform it, as by a renewing power from within, thread by thread, till old things are passed away, and all things are become new.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse....">Matthew 9:16-17</a>. </span><span class="ital">No man putteth a piece of new cloth, </span>&c. — Our Lord, having assigned one reason why he did not enjoin his disciples to fast, namely, because it was not a proper time for it, now proceeds to give another. They were not ripe, or prepared for it, nor could have borne such severe injunctions. As if he had said, Nor do I now think it fit to lay such rigorous commands upon them, but rather to accommodate their trials to their strength; even as when a man is repairing clothes, he will not sew a piece of new cloth on an old garment, but rather chooses what is a little worn, for otherwise it will be found that the new, which is put in, being stronger than the other, taketh from the garment, and the rent is increased. The original words, <span class="greekheb">ρακος αγναφον</span>, properly signify, “<span class="ital">cloth that has not passed through the fuller’s hands, </span>and which is consequently much harsher than what has been washed and worn; and therefore, yielding less than that, will tear away the edges to which it is sewed.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Neither do men put new wine into old bottles — </span>Namely, bottles made of leather, then commonly used, as they are still in some countries. <span class="ital">Else the bottles break </span>— Such bottles, chiefly made of goats’ skins, when old, were not easily distended, and consequently would burst by the fermentation of new wine. <span class="ital">But they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved</span> — Thus our Lord would suit the doctrine he inculcated on his disciples, and the duties which he enjoined them, to their circumstances, and kindly proportion their work to their strength, with a tender regard to their weakness, till, by degrees, they should be fitted for more difficult and humbling services. “And from his example,” says Dr. Doddridge, “and the whole genius of his gospel, let us learn to make all proper allowances to those about us, that we may teach them, and train them up as they are able to bear it; not crushing them under any unnecessary load, nor denying them any indulgence which true friendship will permit us to grant them; lest the good ways of God should be misrepresented, disgraced, and abandoned, through our imprudent, though well-meaning severity: a caution to be peculiarly observed in our conduct toward young persons.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:14-17 John was at this time in prison; his circumstances, his character, and the nature of the message he was sent to deliver, led those who were peculiarly attached to him, to keep frequent fasts. Christ referred them to John's testimony of him, Joh 3:29. Though there is no doubt that Jesus and his disciples lived in a spare and frugal manner, it would be improper for his disciples to fast while they had the comfort of his presence. When he is with them, all is well. The presence of the sun makes day, and its absence produces night. Our Lord further reminded them of common rules of prudence. It was not usual to take a piece of rough woolen cloth, which had never been prepared, to join to an old garment, for it would not join well with the soft, old garment, but would tear it further, and the rent would be made worse. Nor would men put new wine into old leathern bottles, which were going to decay, and would be liable to burst from the fermenting of the wine; but putting the new wine into strong, new, skin bottles, both would be preserved. Great caution and prudence are necessary, that young converts may not receive gloomy and forbidding ideas of the service of our Lord; but duties are to be urged as they are able to bear them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No man putteth a piece of new cloth ... - A second illustration was drawn from a well-known fact, showing also that there was "a propriety or fitness of things." None of you, says he, in mending an old garment, would take a piece of entire new cloth.<p>There would be a waste in it. An old piece, or a piece like the garment, would be better. The word here translated "new," in the original means "rude, undressed, not fulled" by the cloth-dresser. In this state, if applied to an old garment, and if wet, it would "contract" and draw off a part of the garment to which it was attached, and thus make the rent worse than it was. So, says he, my "new" doctrines do not match with the old rites of the Pharisees. There is a fitness of things. Their doctrines require much fasting. In my system it would be incongruous; and if my new doctrines were to be attached to their old ones, it would only make the matter worse.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 9:14-17.

These words are, by <a href="/luke/5-36.htm">Luke 5:36</a> called a "parable", as are those in the following verse; and both are commonly interpreted of the unreasonableness and danger of putting young disciples upon severe exercises of religion, as fasting, &amp;c: and it is true, that young converts are to be tenderly dealt with, as they are by Father, Son, and Spirit, as the disciples were by Christ, and the first Christians were by the apostles: and some things in these parables may seem to agree; as that these austerities should be represented as "new", and as burdensome and troublesome, and the disciples as weak, and easily staggered: but then there are others that will not bear; as that the disciples should be compared to "old garments, and old bottles"; when they were "young" converts, and men "renewed" by the Spirit and grace of God, and had on the beautiful robe of Christ's righteousness; and that such severe exercises, under the notion of religion, should be signified by "new wine", which generally designs something pleasant and agreeable: nor were the disciples unable to bear such severities, who very probably had been trained up in them, and been used to them before their conversion; and could now as well have bore them as John's disciples, or the Pharisees, had they been proper and necessary; but the true reason why they were not required of them, was not their weakness, or danger of falling off, and perishing, of which there were none; but because it was unsuitable to their present situation, the bridegroom being with them. But our Lord, in this parable of putting "a piece of new", or "undressed cloth", such as has never passed through the fuller's hands, and so unfit to mend with, <p>unto an old garment, refers not only to the fastings of the Pharisees, but to their other traditions of the elders, which they held; as such that respected their eating, drinking, and conversing with other persons mentioned in the context, and which observances they joined with their moral performances; on account of which, they looked upon themselves as very righteous persons, and all others as sinners: and to expose their folly, Christ delivers this parable. Wherefore, by "the old garment", I apprehend, is meant their moral and legal righteousness, or their obedience to the moral and ceremonial laws, which was very imperfect, as well as impure, and might be rightly called "filthy rags"; or be compared to an old worn out garment, filthy and loathsome, torn, and full of holes, which cannot keep a person warm, nor screen him from the weather, and so old that it cannot be mended. And by the "piece of new cloth", or "garment", put unto it, or sewed upon it, are intended the traditions of the elders, these men were so fond of, concerning eating, and drinking, and fasting, and hundreds of other things, very idle and trifling, and which were new and upstart notions. Now, by putting, or sewing the new cloth to their old garment, is designed, their joining their observance of these traditions to their other duties of religion, to make up a justifying righteousness before God; but in vain, and to no purpose. Their old garment of their own works, in obedience to the laws of God, moral and ceremonial, was full bad enough of itself; but became abundantly worse, by joining this new piece of men's own devising to it; <p>for that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse: their new obedience to the traditions of men, making void the law of God, instead of mending, marred their righteousness, and left them in a worse condition than it found them: and besides, as it is in Luke, "the piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with the old"; there being no more likeness between the observance of the commandments of men, and obedience to the laws of God, than there is between a piece of new undressed cloth, that has never been washed and worn, and an old worn out garment. Much such a foolish part do those men under the Gospel dispensation act, who join the righteousness of Christ, or a part of it, with their own, in order to make up a justifying righteousness before God; for Christ's righteousness is the only justifying righteousness; it is whole and perfect, and needs nothing to be added to it, nor can it be parted, any more than his seamless coat was; nor a piece taken out of it: nor is there any justification by works, either in whole or in part; the old garment of man's righteousness must be thrown away, in point of justification; it cannot be mended in such a manner; and if any attempts are made in this way, the rent becomes worse: such persons, instead of being justified, are in a worse condition; for they not only set up, and exalt their own righteousness, which is criminal, but disparage the righteousness of Christ as imperfect, by joining it to their's; and whilst they fancy themselves in a good state, are in a most miserable one; harlots and publicans being nearer the kingdom of heaven than these, and enter into it before them; self-righteous persons are more hardly, and with greater difficulty convinced, than such sinners. Moreover, nothing is more disagreeable than such a patch work; Christ's righteousness and a man's own bear no likeness to one another; and such a patched garment must ill become the character and dignity of a saint, a child of God, an heir of heaven. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">No man putteth a piece of <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</span><p>(g) Raw, which was never processed by the fuller.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse....">Matthew 9:16-17</a>. <span class="ital">No one puts a patch consisting of cloth that has not been fulled upon an old robe, for that which is meant to fill up the rent</span> (the patch put on to mend the old garment) <span class="ital">tears off from the</span> (old rotten) <span class="ital">cloak</span>, when it gets damp or happens to be spread out, or stretched, or such like. That <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> does not refer to the piece of unfulled cloth (Euth.

T. 757]. The <span class="ital">point of the comparison</span> lies in the fact that such a proceeding is not only <span class="ital">unsuitable</span>, but a positive <span class="ital">hindrance to the end in view</span>. “The old forms of piety amid which John and his disciples still move are not suited to the new religious life emanating from me. To try to embody the latter in the former, is to proceed in a manner as much calculated to defeat its purpose as when one tries to patch an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth, which, instead of mending it, as it is intended to do, only makes the rent greater than ever; or as when one seeks to fill old bottles with new wine, and ends in losing wine and bottles together. The new life needs new forms.” The Catholics, following Chrysostom and Theophylact, and by way of finding something in favour of fastings, have erroneously explained the old garment and old bottles as referring to the <span class="ital">disciples</span>, from whom, as “adhuc infirmes et veteri adsuetis homini” (Jansen), it was, as yet, too much to expect the severer mode of life for which, on the contrary (<a href="/matthew/9-17.htm" title="Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.">Matthew 9:17</a>), they would have to be previously prepared by the operation of the Holy Spirit. This is directly opposed to the meaning of Jesus’ words, and not in accordance with the development of the apostolic church (<a href="/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a> ff.), by which fasting, as legal penance, was necessarily included among the <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου</span>, however much it may have been valued and observed as the spontaneous outcome of an inward necessity (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a> f., <a href="/matthew/14-23.htm" title="And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.">Matthew 14:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>).

This difference is interpreted partly in favour of Luke (Schleiermacher, Neander, Bleek), partly of Matthew (de Wette, Holtzmann, Keim), while Strauss rejects both. For my part, I decide for Matthew; first, because his simpler narrative bears no traces of another hand (which, however, can scarcely be said of that of Luke); and then, because the whole answer of Jesus, so <span class="ital">mild</span> (indeed touching, <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>) in its character, indicates that those who put the question can hardly have been the <span class="ital">Pharisees</span>, to whom He had just spoken in a very different tone. <a href="/mark/2-18.htm" title="And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?">Mark 2:18</a> ff., again (which Ewald holds to be the more original), certainly does not represent the pure version of the matter as regards the questioners, who, according to his account, are the disciples of John <span class="ital">and</span> the Pharisees,—an incongruity, however, which owes its origin to the question itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse....">Matthew 9:16-17</a>.

These sayings, apparently simple, are somewhat abstruse. They must have been over the head of the average Christian of the apostolic age, and Luke’s version shows that they were diversely interpreted. Common to both is the idea that it is bootless to mix heterogeneous things, old and new in religion. This cuts two ways. It defends the old as well as the new; the fasting of John’s disciples as well as the non-fasting of Christ’s. Jesus did not concern Himself about Pharisaic practice, but He was concerned to defend His own disciples without disparagement of John, and also to prevent John’s way and the respect in which he was justly held from creating a prejudice against Himself. The double application of the principle was therefore present to His mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">No man</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">but</span> no man.

He says in effect to John’s disciples: “Your question implies ignorance of my teaching. My doctrine is not merely a reformed Judaism like the teaching of John and Pharisaism, it is a new life to which such questions as these concerning ceremonial fasting are quite alien.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">new</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">uncarded, raw</span>. The old garment is Judaism. Christianity is not to be pieced on to Judaism to fill up its deficiencies. This would make the rent—the divisions of Judaism—still more serious. The word translated “rent” is used of the “schisms” in the Corinthian Church, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, and has so passed into ecclesiastical language; it is the English “schism.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδεὶς</span>, <span class="ital">no one</span>) Our Lord chose, as His disciples, men who were unlearned, fresh and simple, and imbued with no peculiar discipline.—See ch. <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>; cf.

"And" is slightly adversative. They will indeed fast then, yet fasting does not belong to the essence of my teaching. To insist on fasting would only be right if my teaching came merely into mechanical connexion with the religion of the day. But this is not the case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Treated as an addition, it injures the religion of the day (ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Treated as something to be accepted by all Jews, regardless of their moral fitness for it, it is itself wasted,  and also ruins those who so accept it (ver. 17).

My teaching is intended to be more than a patch (however good a patch) sewn on to the religion of the day. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>New (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>From &#x3b1;&#787;, not, and &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, to card or comb wool; hence to dress or full cloth. Therefore Rev. renders more correctly undressed cloth, which would shrink when wet, and tear loose from the old piece. Wyc. renders rude. Jesus thus pictures the combination of the old forms of piety peculiar to John and his disciples with the new religious life emanating from himself, as the patching of an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth, which would stretch and tear loose from the old fabric and make a worse rent than before. </body></html>
