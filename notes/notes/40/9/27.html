The title by which the blind address our Lord as “the Son of David,” was that which expressed the popular belief that He was the expected Christ. It is used afterwards by the woman of Canaan (<a href="/matthew/15-22.htm" title="And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.">Matthew 15:22</a>), and again by the blind at Jericho (<a href="/context/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30-31</a>; <a href="/mark/10-47.htm" title="And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.">Mark 10:47</a>; <a href="/context/luke/18-38.htm" title="And he cried, saying, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.">Luke 18:38-39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/9-27.htm" title="And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us....">Matthew 9:27-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when Jesus departed thence — </span>Namely, from the ruler’s house; <span class="ital">two blind men, </span>who probably had heard of his being there, and waited for his coming out; <span class="ital">followed him </span>— As he went through the streets, <span class="ital">crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us </span>— The title which they here give him, shows that they believed him to be the Messiah; for, at this time, it was not only universally understood that the Messiah would be a descendant of David, but <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of David </span>was one of the names then ascribed to him by the Jews; see <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm" title="And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?">Matthew 12:23</a>; and <a href="/context/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David....">Matthew 22:42-45</a>. As these men were blind, they could have no evidence of Christ’s miracles from their senses. They believed them, therefore, on the testimony of others who had seen them. Viewed in this light, their persuasion of Christ’s power to cure them was an exercise of faith highly commendable in them, and which reflected great honour upon Jesus, as on the one hand it showed their sincerity and freedom from the prejudices which blinded the minds of the generality of the Jews; and, on the other, the truth and notoriety of his miracles. It was, therefore, for the glory of God and for the edification of others, that the strength of their faith should be discovered. This was done by their persevering to importune him to have mercy upon them, notwithstanding he seemed at the first to refuse them, and by the answer which they returned to his question concerning their faith. <span class="ital">Then </span>— When their faith was thus sufficiently manifested, <span class="ital">he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you </span>— And immediately on his speaking these words, <span class="ital">their eyes were opened. </span>Such is the mighty power of the prayer of faith, and such is the honour wherewith Christ often crowns it! <span class="ital">And Jesus straitly charged them, </span>&c. — “The word <span class="greekheb">ενεβριμησατο</span>, thus translated, is rendered by Phavorinus, <span class="ital">to charge, to command, to appoint with authority: </span>by Hesychius, <span class="ital">to command, or charge with a threat. </span>It signifies a rational, not a passionate earnestness and vehemence.” — Hammond. Christ’s command of silence, says Baxter, (namely, concerning the miracle,) “was partly to give us an example of avoiding ostentation and hypocrisy, and to be content with the approbation of God alone.” Of other reasons why he forbade his miracles to be divulged, see note on <a href="/matthew/8-4.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Matthew 8:4</a>. These men, however, were so overjoyed on account of the miracle which Christ had wrought for them, and so full of gratitude to him for the restoration of their sight, that they could not forbear speaking of it wherever they came; by which means his fame was spread abroad in all that country. It had been expressly foretold by the prophet, that the Messiah should open the eyes of the blind; (see <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm" title="The LORD opens the eyes of the blind: the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD loves the righteous:">Psalm 146:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm" title="Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm" title="To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.">Isaiah 42:7</a>;) and this is the first instance recorded by the evangelists in which Jesus proved himself to be the Messiah, by fulfilling those predictions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:27-31 At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind men knew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, and that Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost their bodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of their understanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdens are, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed him crying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always to pray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. They followed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that can work faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls by the power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upon their faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, not according to their fancies, nor according to their profession, but according to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when Jesus departed thence - The scene of this miracle was near Capernaum.

Can there be a doubt that their faith fastened on such great Messianic promises as this, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened," &c.

From a consideration of these details, the conclusion seems inevitable that we have, in fact, narratives of two distinct occurrences, but it is quite consistent with tiffs conclusion to suppose that during the oral transmission of the narratives a certain amount of assimilation took place. Upon this supposition, it further appears probable that, as the narrative in ch. 20. was the better known, for it was in the Petrine cycle, our narrative became assimilated to it rather than the reverse. On the other hand, the number recorded in ch. 20. (not Mark or Luke) looks much like an assimilation to that of our incident (cf. the notes on the section <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28-34</a>, ver. 31, and the section vers. 32-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus departed thence.</span> As he was passing along on his way <span class="accented">thence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the house of Jairus, if the context be pressed.
