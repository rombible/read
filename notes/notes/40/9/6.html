The two passages are so closely parallel that we can hardly be wrong in thinking that the words now spoken were meant to recall those which some, at least, of those who listened had heard before. This view, at any rate, brings out the fulness of their meaning. As they stand here, they seem to include both the two hypotheses mentioned in the Note on <a href="/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>. The Father had given Him authority to “forgive sins” and to “execute judgment” because He was the Son of Man, the representative of mankind, and as such was exercising a delegated power. But then, that discourse in John 5 showed that He also spoke of Himself as the Son of God as well as the Son of Man (<a href="/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>), and as such claimed an honour equal to that which was rightly paid to the Father (<a href="/john/5-23.htm" title="That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.">John 5:23</a>). Ultimately, therefore, our Lord’s answer rests on the higher, and not the lower, of the two grounds on which the objectors might have been met.<p><span class= "bld">Arise, take up thy bed.</span>—As St. Mark gives the words we have the very syllables that had been spoken to the “impotent man” at Bethesda (<a href="/john/5-8.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.">John 5:8</a>), and in any case words identical in meaning; and the natural inference is that our Lord meant to recall what the scribes from Jerusalem had then seen and heard.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 The faith of the friends of the paralytic in bringing him to Christ, was a strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could and would heal him. A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend on Christ. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sickness not be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort of recovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This is no encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thy malady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; but to come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still to retain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion. The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought, is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to save his people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes, and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to be carried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must be glorified in all the power that is given to do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But that ye may know ... - That you may have full proof on that point; that you may see that I have power to forgive sin, I will perform an act which all must perceive and admit to require the power of God.<p>Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine own house - The fact that the paralytic man could do this would prove that a miracle was performed. He was healed by a word; it was done instantaneously; it was done in the most public manner. The fact that a man, just before perfectly helpless, could now take up and carry his own bed or couch, proved that a divine "power" had been exerted; and that fact proved that he who had performed the miracle must also have the "power" and the "authority" to forgive sin. It is proper to add, in illustrating this, that in the East a "bed" is often nothing more than a bolster and a blanket spread on the floor. "The bed provided for me," says Professor Hackett ("Illustrations of Scripture," p. 112) "consisted merely of a bolster and a blanket spread on the floor. The latter could be drawn partially over the body if any one wished, though the expectation seemed to be that we should sleep in our ordinary dress, without any additional covering. Such a bed is obviously a portable one; it is easy to take it up, fold it together, and carry it from place to place, as convenience may require." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Mt 9:1-8.

Further, if, as seems likely,. the phrase was understood to symbolize the nation, he desired them to see in himself the great means whereby the nation should rise to its ideal. If, as is possible, though hardly probable, this saying of our Lord's is chronologically earlier than <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and there,-fore the earliest occasion on which he used the phrase, the almost direct reference to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> makes it the more interesting. <span class="cmt_word">(Then saith he to the sick of the palsy). </span> The thought of the sentence is continued, but as he now turns directly to the sick man, its form is altered. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, take up</span>.
