The “multitude” gave free expression to their natural wonder, which, though it did not actually amount to faith, was yet one step towards it.

Christ's cures strike at the root, and remove the effect by taking away the cause; they open the lips, by breaking Satan's power in the soul. Nothing can convince those who are under the power of pride. They will believe anything, however false or absurd, rather than the Holy Scriptures; thus they show the enmity of their hearts against a holy God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake - The miracle is narrated in the briefest terms; but the effect was immediate and the restoration was complete.<p>It was never so seen in Israel - Never was there in our land - among the Jews - such a succession of wonders, so striking, so marvelous, so full of the power of God.

The word in the Greek signifies deaf as well as dumb, for all persons who are deaf from their birth are also dumb. But it is probable this man was only accidentally dumb, from the power of the devil, that had possessed him, and suppressed his speech. It is observed that Christ cured, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Some that came on their own accord to him, as the woman with her bloody flux. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Others that could not come, but were brought to him, as the paralytic, before mentioned in this chapter, who was willingly brought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

The cause of his dumbness being removed, the effect ceased, and the man spake as he did before, and as other men do; and this was done, according to the Persic version, "as soon as Christ saw him"; the devil not being able to bear his presence, much less withstand his power: but as soon as Christ had set his eyes upon the man possessed by him, and had given him orders to be gone, he immediately went out, and the man was restored to his speech again; <p>and the multitude marvelled, saying, it was never so seen in Israel. The vast crowds of people, who were alarmed with the former miracles of Christ, and came along with the friends of the dumb man, when they heard him speak so suddenly and plainly, and with so much freedom, nothing being said or done to him, were surprised; and declared very frankly, that though many wonderful things had been done in Israel, in times past, by Moses, Elijah, Elisha, and others, yet never were such things seen, or heard, or known of, as were done by Christ: referring not to this miracle only, but to all the rest he had just wrought; as curing the woman of her bloody issue, raising Jairus's daughter from the dead, restoring sight to the two blind men, and now casting out a dumb devil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/9-33.htm" title="And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.">Matthew 9:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλάλησεν</span>: that cured, speech followed.—<span class="greekheb">ἐθαύμασαν</span>: the crowd present wondered, hearing one speak whom they had so long known to be dumb.—<span class="greekheb">οὐδέποτε ἐφάνη</span>, etc.: thus they expressed their surprise; the like was never seen in Israel. <span class="greekheb">ἐφάνη</span> is impersonal, the reference being to the change in the man; the manner of expression is colloquial, and it is idle to discuss the precise meaning of <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>, and what nominative is to be supplied to <span class="greekheb">ἐφάνη</span>. It is more to the purpose to inquire why this seemingly minor miracle should make so great an impression. Perhaps we should not isolate it, but take it along with the other marvels that followed in quick succession as joint causes of admiration. The people were worked up into a high measure of astonishment which, at last, found vent in these words.
