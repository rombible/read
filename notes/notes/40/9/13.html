To have withdrawn from contact with sinners would have been a formal “sacrifice,” such as Pharisees delighted to offer, and from which they took their very name; but the claims or “mercy” were higher, and bade Him mingle with them. It was the very purpose of His coming, not to call “righteous men” (again with studied reference to their own estimate of themselves), but “sinners,” and to call them, not to continue as they were, but, as St. Luke adds (the words are wanting in the best MSS. here and also in St. Mark), “to repentance.” We may, perhaps, infer further, that when the scribes were told to consider what the prophet’s words meant, there was also some reference to the context of those words. They would find their own likeness in the words, “Your goodness is as a morning cloud; . . . they . . . have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against me” (<a href="/hosea/6-4.htm" title="O Ephraim, what shall I do to you?

He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectually brought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought to him. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will not welcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees; they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but the poor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction and amendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructions upon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that those have not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others' obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy; for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy. The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change our minds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let us examine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned to follow the directions of our great Physician.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But go ye and learn ... - To reprove them, and to vindicate his own conduct, he appealed to a passage of Scripture with which they ought to have been acquainted: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice," <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>. This is not a declaration on the part of God that he was opposed to "sacrifices" or "offerings for sin;" for he had appointed and commanded many, and had therefore expressed his approbation of them. It is a Hebrew mode of speaking, and means, "I prefer mercy to sacrifice;" or, "I am more pleased with acts of benevolence and kindness than with a mere external compliance with the duties of religion." Mercy here means benevolence or kindness toward others. "Sacrifices" were offerings made to God on account of sin, or as an expression of thanksgiving. They were commonly bloody offerings, or animals slain; signifying that the sinner offering them deserved to die himself, and pointing to the great sacrifice or offering which Christ was to make for the sins of the world. "Sacrifices" were the principal part of the worship of the Jews, and hence came to signify "external worship in general." This is the meaning of the word here. The sense in which our Saviour applies it is this: "You Pharisees are exceedingly tenacious of the "external" duties of religion; but God has declared that he prefers benevolence or mercy to those external duties. It is proper, therefore, that I should associate with sinners for the purpose of doing them good."<p>I came not to call the righteous ... - No human beings are by nature righteous, <a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-18</a>. The Pharisees, however, "pretended" to be righteous. Christ might have meant by this answer that it was not the design of his coming to cal such persons to repentance, knowing that they would spurn his efforts, and that to a great extent they would be vain; or, more probably, he meant to affirm that his proper and only business was to call to repentance such people as he was now with. He came to seek and save such, and it was his "proper business," therefore, to associate with them.<p>Repentance - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. But go ye and learn what that meaneth&#8212;(Ho 6:6),<p>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice&#8212;that is, the one rather than the other. "Sacrifice," the chief part of the ceremonial law, is here put for a religion of literal adherence to mere rules; while "mercy" expresses such compassion for the fallen as seeks to lift them up. The duty of keeping aloof from the polluted, in the sense of "having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness," is obvious enough; but to understand this as prohibiting such intercourse with them as is necessary to their recovery, is to abuse it. This was what these pharisaical religionists did, and this is what our Lord here exposes.<p>for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance&#8212;The italicized words are of doubtful authority here, and more than doubtful authority in Mr 2:17; but in Lu 5:32 they are undisputed. We have here just the former statement stripped of its figure. "The righteous" are the whole; "sinners," the sick. When Christ "called" the latter, as He did Matthew, and probably some of those publicans and sinners whom he had invited to meet Him, it was to heal them of their spiritual maladies, or save their souls: "The righteous," like those miserable self-satisfied Pharisees, "He sent empty away."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 12,13.

So the phrase , "what that is", or "what that meaneth", is Talmudic, as,  "what is it?" , "what is that which is written?" , "what is the Scripture?" that is, what is the meaning of it? Our Lord speaks in their own dialect, and tacitly reproves their ignorance of the Scriptures; and instead of finding fault with him, and his conduct, he intimates, it would better become them to endeavour to find out the meaning of that passage in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a> "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice"; which, if rightly understood, was sufficient to silence all their cavils and objections: and which words are to be taken, not in an absolute and unlimited sense; for sacrifices even of slain beasts, which were offered up in the faith of Christ's sacrifice, and were attended with other acts of religion and piety, were acceptable to God, being his own institutions and appointments; but in a comparative sense, as the following clause in the prophet shows; "and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings"; and so the sense is given in the "Chaldee paraphrase", after this manner: "for in those that exercise mercy is my good will and pleasure", or "delight",  "more than in sacrifice": and the meaning is, that God takes more delight and pleasure, either in showing mercy himself to poor miserable sinners; or in acts of mercy, compassion, and beneficence done by men, to fallen creatures in distress, whether for the good of their bodies, or more especially for the welfare of their souls, than he does even in sacrifices, and in any of the rituals of the ceremonial law, though of his own appointing: and therefore must be supposed to have a less regard to sacrifices, which were offered, neither in a right manner, nor from a right principle, nor to a right end; and still less to human traditions, and customs, which were put upon a level, and even preferred to his institutions; such as these the Pharisees were so zealous of. The force of our Lord's reasoning is, that since his conversation, with publicans and sinners, was an act of mercy and compassion to their souls, and designed for their spiritual good; it must be much more pleasing to God, than had he attended to the traditions of the elders, they charge him with the breach of: besides, what he was now doing was the end of his coming into this world, and which was answered hereby; <p>for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance. The phrase, "to repentance", is not in the Vulgate Latin, nor in Munster's Hebrew Gospel, nor in the Syriac, Ethiopic, and Persic versions; but is in the Arabic, and in the ancient Greek copies, and is very justly retained. The "repentance" here designed, is not a legal, but an evangelical one: which is attended with faith in Christ, with views, at least hopes of pardon through his blood, and springs from a discovery and sense of his love: it lies in a true sense of sin, and the exceeding sinfulness of it, by the light of the Spirit of God; in a godly sorrow for it, and hearty loathing of it; in real shame and blushing for it, ingenuous confession of it, and departing from it; all which is brought on, influenced, heightened, and increased, by displays of the love of God through Christ. The persons called to this are not the "righteous"; meaning either such who are really so, because these are already called to it, though, whilst in a state of imperfection, daily need the exercise of this grace; or rather such who are so in their own opinion, and in the sight of men only, not in the sight of God, which was the case of the Scribes and Pharisees, and very few of these were called and brought to repentance; but "sinners", even the worst, and chief of sinners, who, as they stand in need of this grace, and when thoroughly convinced, see they do; so Christ came into this world as prophet and minister of the word to "call" them to it: which call of his does not suppose that they had a power to repent of themselves; for this man has not, he is naturally blind, and do not see his sin; his heart is hard and obdurate, and till his eyes are opened, and his stony heart taken away by a superior power to his own, he will never repent; though he may have space, yet if he has not grace given him, he will remain impenitent. No means will bring him to it of themselves, neither the most severe judgments, nor the greatest kindnesses, nor the most powerful ministry; repentance is entirely a free grace gift: nor does the call of Christ imply the contrary; which may be considered either as external, as a preacher of the word, and as such was not always attended to, and effectual, but often slighted and rejected: or as internal, being by the power of his grace effectual; for he who called to repentance, as a minister of the word, as a prince and a saviour, was able to give it, and which none but a divine person is able to do. The Jews have a saying (b) of <p>"shepherds, collectors of taxes and "publicans", , "that their repentance is difficult".'' <p>Now, since this was the end of his coming into the world, his conduct in conversing with publicans and sinners was in all respects highly to be justified. <p>(a) T.

After having justified His holding intercourse with publicans and sinners, Jesus with the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> proceeds to tell the Pharisees what they would have to do in order to their receiving His invitation to be healed: “<span class="ital">but go and learn what is meant by that saying of the Scripture</span> (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>, LXX.), <span class="ital">I will have mercy and not sacrifice</span>.” You must understand that first of all, if you are to be of the number of those who are to be invited to enter the Messiah’s kingdom: “<span class="ital">for I am not come to call righteous, but sinners</span>” (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>).

According to <span class="ital">others</span>, Jesus wishes <span class="ital">to justify His conduct</span>, inasmuch as the exhibition of love and mercy constitutes the Messiah’s highest duty (Ewald, Bleek). This, however, is less probable, owing to the <span class="greekheb">πορευθέντες</span> with which He dismisses them from His presence, the analogy of <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>, and the very apt allusion in <span class="greekheb">οὐ θυσίαν</span> to the Pharisees with their legal pride.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πορευθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μάθετε</span>] corresponds to the Rabbinical form <span class="greekheb">צא ולמד</span>, which is used in sending one away, with a view to fuller reflection upon some matter or other, or with a view to being first of all instructed regarding it; see Schoettgen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>] assigns the reason for the <span class="greekheb">πορευθέντες μάθετε</span>, through which <span class="greekheb">μανθάνειν</span> they are first to be rendered capable of receiving the invitation to participate in the blessings of the kingdom.

In the present instance, the neuter, though possessing the authority of B C* D <span class="greekheb">א</span> (like <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>), was naturally adopted from the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ θυς</span>.] The negative is absolute, in accordance with the idea aut … aut.

Sometimes, however, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἜΛΕΟς</span>, like the ancient Greeks. <a href="/isaiah/60-10.htm" title="And the sons of strangers shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you: for in my wrath I smote you, but in my favor have I had mercy on you.">Isaiah 60:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm" title="I will mention the loving kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.">Isaiah 63:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-9.htm" title="Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.">Daniel 1:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm" title="And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;">Daniel 9:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/101-1.htm" title="I will sing of mercy and judgment: to you, O LORD, will I sing.">Psalm 101:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-57.htm" title="David for being merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom.">1Ma 2:57</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-44.htm" title="Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.">1Ma 3:44</a>; and especially in the minor prophets, <a href="/jonah/2-9.htm" title="But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.">Jonah 2:9</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a> (which passage is also parallel with the evangelist), Ibid. <a href="/matthew/7-20.htm" title="Why by their fruits you shall know them.">Matthew 7:20</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:">Zechariah 7:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm" title="Therefore turn you to your God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on your God continually.">Hosea 12:6</a>. Thus <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἜΛΕΟς</span> occurs in the present passage, in <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>; but <span class="greekheb">ΤΌ ἜΛΕΟς</span> occurs frequently in St Luke, St Paul, St James, St Peter, St John, and St Jude; and in <a href="/micah/7-18.htm" title="Who is a God like to you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.">Micah 7:18</a>, the LXX., have <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΛΗΤῊς ἘΛΈΟΥς ἘΣΤῚΝ</span>, <span class="ital">He is a willer of mercy</span>. We have here an axiom of interpretation, nay, the sum total of that part of theology which treats of cases of conscience. On <span class="ital">mercy</span>, cf. ch. <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>. The word <span class="greekheb">θυσίαν</span>, <span class="ital">sacrifice</span> (victimam), is put synecdochically.[411] It is an act of <span class="ital">mercy</span> to eat with sinners for their spiritual profit.[412]—<span class="greekheb">ἦλθον</span>, <span class="ital">I have come</span>) sc. from heaven.—<span class="greekheb">καλέσαι</span>, <span class="ital">to call</span>) Such is the mission, such the authority of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">sinners</span>) The word is purposely and emphatically repeated by our Lord. Cf. <a href="/matthew/9-11.htm" title="And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners?">Matthew 9:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[409] In the original “Alieniores,”—an expression which is used several times by Bengel in the course of this gospel, and which it is easier to understand than to translate.—(I.

But go ye and learn</span>. A common rabbinic phrase based on the fact that the disputants would not always have the cumbrous rolls of Scripture actually with them. These Pharisees pro-reseed to be students of Scripture, but had not yet learned the principle taught in this passage<span class="cmt_word">. What that meaneth, I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">have</span> (I <span class="accented">desire</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">mercy,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and not sacrifice</span>. <span class="accented">Mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In the original connexion of this quotation (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>) the words are without doubt (but cf. Dr. Taylor's 'Gospel in the Law,' p. 10) an expression of God's desire that his people should show mercy rather than only perform external sacrifices, and this meaning is probably intended by our Lord here also. The connexion will then be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">I</span> wish you to show mercy rather than perform external actions, for only thus will you resemble me in my coming to call sinners;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I wish you to show this mercy, and therefore I practise it myself." The former seems the more natural. It is, however, possible that our Lord disregards the original context of the words, and uses them only as a summary of an important truth, that God prefers to show mercy rather than to insist on sacrifice. This would make excellent sense here, viz. "Learn the true principle by which God acts, free grace, for it is on this that I have acted in coming to call sinners." (So nearly Dr. Taylor, op. c<span class="accented">it.</span>, p. 3.) The sentence is quoted again in <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>, where the original thought of the words seems more certainly applicable. <span class="cmt_word">For I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am not come;</span> <span class="accented">for I came not</span> (Revised Version). Christ refers to his historic coming in the Incarnation rather than to his abiding presence (cf. also <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To call the righteous, but sinners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). The English generic article in the first term spoils the anarthrous expression of the Greek by lessening the contrast between the two classes. Dr. Taylor suggests the rendering, "not <span class="accented">saints</span>, <span class="accented">but sinners"</span> (<span class="accented">op. cit.</span>, p. 4). <span class="cmt_word">To repentance</span>.
