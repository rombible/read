Referring to the Note in the <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a> for the general question as to “possession,” it may be noted here that the phenomena presented in this case were those of catalepsy, or of insanity showing itself in obstinate and sullen silence. The dumbness was a spiritual disease, not the result of congenital malformation. The work of healing restored the man to sanity rather than removed a bodily imperfection. Comp. the analogous phenomena in <a href="/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22</a>, <a href="/luke/11-14.htm" title="And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.">Luke 11:14</a>. The latter agrees so closely with this that but for the fact of St. Matthew’s connecting our Lord’s answer to the accusation of the Pharisees with the second of these miracles, we might have supposed the two identical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/9-32.htm" title="As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil....">Matthew 9:32-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">As they went out </span>— Namely, the men that had been blind; <span class="ital">behold, they brought to him a dumb man </span>— Whose dumbness was owing to his being <span class="ital">possessed with a devil. </span>From the circumstance of this demoniac’s being dumb, Erasmus conjectures that he was also deprived of the use of his reason. If so, being insensible of his own misery, he had as little inclination as ability to apply for a cure. He could not even make his misery known by signs, and therefore needed to be brought to the Saviour by others. <span class="ital">And when the devil was cast out </span>— Namely, by the powerful word of Jesus; <span class="ital">the dumb spake </span>— Readily, distinctly, rationally, and fluently. <span class="ital">And the multitude marvelled </span>— Were astonished both at the greatness of the miracle and at the instantaneous manner in which it was wrought, as also at the many other miracles which they had just seen performed. <span class="ital">Saying, It was never so seen in Israel </span>— Not even in <span class="ital">Israel, </span>where so many wonders have been seen. “This reflection was perfectly just; for no one of the prophets, that we read of in the Old Testament, appears to have wrought so many beneficial miracles in his whole life, as our Lord did in this one afternoon.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils </span>— Not being able to deny facts that were so notorious, in order to prevent the effect which they saw them likely to produce on the people, (namely, to convince them that Jesus was the Messiah,) being moved with the bitterest spite against him, they impudently, and contrary to all reason and common sense, affirmed that instead of being the Christ, or a prophet, he was a vile magician, who cast out devils by the help of Beelzebub, their prince. A calumny this which the Pharisees frequently uttered, but which our Lord fully confuted, as the reader will see in the notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw....">Matthew 12:22-30</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:32-34 Of the two, better a dumb devil than a blaspheming one.

The Syriac version reads it, "when Jesus went out"; to which agrees the Arabic, against all the copies: for not he, but the men who had been blind, and now had their sight restored, went out from the house where Jesus was; which circumstance is mentioned, and by it the following account is introduced, partly to show how busy Christ was, how he was continually employed in doing good, and that as soon as one work of mercy was over, another offered; and partly, to observe how closely and exactly the prophecies of the Old Testament were fulfilled; in which, as it was foretold, that "the eyes of the blind" should "be opened"; so likewise, that "the tongue of the dumb" should "sing",  <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. <p>Behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. The word signifies one that is deaf, as well as dumb; as does the Hebrew word  often used by the Jewish writers for a deaf and dumb man; one, they say (g), that can neither hear nor speak, and is unfit for sacrifice, and excused many things: and indeed these two, deafness and dumbness, always go together in persons, who are deaf from their birth; for as they cannot hear, they cannot learn to speak: but this man seems to be dumb, not by nature, but through the possession of Satan, who had taken away, or restrained the use of his speech, out of pure malice and ill will, that he might not have the benefit of conversation with men, nor be able to say anything to the glory of God. This man did not come of himself to Christ, perhaps being unwilling, through the power and influence the devil had over him; but his friends, who were concerned for his welfare, and who were thoroughly persuaded of the power of Christ to heal him, by the miracles they had seen, or heard performed by him, brought him to him; and, no doubt, expressed their desire that he would cast out the devil, and cure him, which he did. <p>(g) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

Formerly it was <span class="ital">usual</span> to interpret thus: <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> stands for <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> or <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτό τι</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">כֵּן</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.">1 Samuel 23:17</a>).

The astonishment of the multitudes and their confession.</span> [<span class="accented">The accusation by the Pharisees.</span>] The whole narrative greatly resembles the cure of the blind and dumb man possessed with a devil (<a href="/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-24</a>; <a href="/luke/11-14.htm">Luke 11:14, 15</a>), as may be seen from the fact that the following words are common to both passages, the brackets indicating a want of exact correspondence in the original. "They brought to him one possessed with a devil, dumb, and the [dumb spake]. And the multitudes [said.]... But the Pharisees, He casteth out the devils by... the prince of the devils." One explanation is that the two narratives are taken kern different sources, but represent the same incident; another, that as in vers. 27-31, so also here, the narratives of two similar incidents have become assimilated. At any rate, in the case of ver. 34 there has probably been assimilation, and that since the writing of the Gospel. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ver. 34 is wanting in D, the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">k</span>, Hilary and Juvencns, and is therefore rightly bracketed by Westcott and Hort as perhaps "<span class="accented">a</span> Western non-interpolation" (2. &sect; 240). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The verse seems to be hardly in complete accordance with the aim of the whole section, which ends much more suitably with the effect on the multitudes. In <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> the verse forms a climax (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2, 10, 14</a>). But here there has been no opposition mentioned since the very beginning of the chapter (for the disobedience of the blind men cannot be so called), so that the monstrous accusation comes in quite unexpectedly. Observe that this is not a case in which subjective difficulties are in themselves a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> argument for the genuineness of a phrase, for the early copyists troubled themselves very little about questions of the internal arrangement and the general aim of the sections. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">-</span> (<span class="accented">And</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">as they went out</span> (<span class="accented">forth</span>, Revised Version; ver. 31).
