A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend on Christ. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sickness not be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort of recovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This is no encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thy malady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; but to come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still to retain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion. The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought, is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to save his people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes, and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to be carried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must be glorified in all the power that is given to do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They glorified God - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>. To "glorify" God, here, means to "praise him," or to acknowledge his power. The expression, "which had given such power to people," was a part of "their" praise. It expresses no sentiment of the evangelist about the nature of Christ, but is a record of their feelings and their praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Mt 9:1-8.

He immediately stands upon his feet, takes up his bed, or couch, <span class="ital">that whereon he lay, </span>( saith Luke), and went home in the sight of them all, so as none could doubt concerning the cure.

Here is not a word of their believing and owning Christ as the Son of God, which was the great thing the miracle was wrought to bring them to; but blindness was happened to Israel, seeing they saw and could not perceive. The miracle wrought in them an awe and reverence of him as an extraordinary person, and put them into a kind of ecstasy and admiration; and the text saith they <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">glorified God; </span> but not aright: they praised God, not for sending his Son into the world to save sinners, but for giving <span class="ital">such power unto men; </span> they would still own Christ no more than a man, though a man to whom God had given great power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a></span>.
