As One who taught as “having authority, and not as the scribes” (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm" title="For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.">Matthew 7:29</a>), He challenges their right to interrogate Him on the ground of precedent. Had they exercised that right in the case of the Baptist, and if so, with what result? If they had left his claim unquestioned, or if they had shrunk from confessing the result of their inquiry, they had virtually abdicated their office, and had no right, in logical consistency, to exercise it, as by fits and starts, in the case of another teacher.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:23-27 As our Lord now openly appeared as the Messiah, the chief priests and scribes were much offended, especially because he exposed and removed the abuses they encouraged. Our Lord asked what they thought of John's ministry and baptism. Many are more afraid of the shame of lying than of the sin, and therefore scruple not to speak what they know to be false, as to their own thoughts, affections, and intentions, or their remembering and forgetting. Our Lord refused to answer their inquiry. It is best to shun needless disputes with wicked opposers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Jesus answered ... - Jesus was under no obligation to give them an answer.<p>They well knew by what authority he did this. He had not concealed his power in working miracles, and had not kept back the knowledge that he was the Messiah. He therefore referred them to a similar case - that of John the Baptist. He knew the estimation in which John was held by the people, and he took the wise in their own craftiness. Whatever answer they gave, he knew they Would convict themselves, and so they saw when they looked at the question. They reasoned correctly. If they should say that John received authority to baptize from God or from heaven, he would directly ask why they did not believe him. They professed to hear all the prophets. If they said, "Of men," they would be in danger, for all the people believed that John was a prophet.<p>The baptism of John - For an account of this, see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3</a>. The word "baptism" here probably includes all his work. This was his principal employment; and hence he was called the Baptist, or the "Baptizer." But our Saviour's question refers "to his whole ministry." "The 'ministry of John' - his baptism, preaching, prophecies was it from God, or not?" If it was, then the inference was clear that Jesus was the Messiah, and then they might easily know by what authority he did those things.<p>From heaven - By divine authority, or by the command of God.<p>From men - By human authority.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The question of the Elders was really an attack. Jesus meets that attack by a counter-question which presented equal difficulties in three ways—whether they said from heaven or of men, or left it unanswered. To say from heaven was equivalent to acknowledging Jesus as Christ, to say from men was to incur the hostility of the people, to be silent was to resign their pretensions as spiritual chiefs of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-24.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.">Matthew 21:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς</span>, <span class="ital">but Jesus answered</span>, etc.) A suitable mode of answering those who tempted Him.—<span class="greekheb">ἐρωτήσω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">I will also ask you</span>, etc.) Thus also in ch. <a href="/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,">Matthew 22:41</a>.

John the Baptist, though without a human call, could be and was a prophet; therefore also Jesus. If they had acknowledged the baptism of His forerunner, they would have acknowledged the authority of Christ; but since they did not acknowledge John (see <a href="/matthew/21-32.htm" title="For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.">Matthew 21:32</a>), they could not believe in Jesus. Nor did they deserve that any further communications should be thrown away by Him on their pride and unbelief.

Jesus does not reply directly to their insidious demand. He might have asserted his Divine mission, and appealed to his miracles in confirmation of such claim, which would have been in strict conformity with the old, established rule for discriminating false and true prophets (see <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>); but he knew too well their scepticism and malice and inveterate prejudice to lay stress on this allegation at the present moment. Before he satisfied their inquiry, he must have their opinion concerning one whom they had received as a prophet a few years ago, and whose memory was still held in the highest respect, John the Baptist. The manner in which they regarded him and his testimony would enable them to answer their own interrogation. </body></html>
