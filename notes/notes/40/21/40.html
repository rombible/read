As men treat God's people, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, if faithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wicked world, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us ask ourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages, render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separate persons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of the vineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy the wicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and they would not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as a despised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced by the Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. But God has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ become more and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation and Cornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, though despised and hated for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the lord, therefore ... - Jesus then asked them a question about the proper way of dealing with those people.<p>The design of asking them this question was that they might condemn themselves, and admit the justice of the punishment that was soon to come upon them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40.
