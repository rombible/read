As the prophets looked forward to him, and all bore witness to him; so he looked back upon them, that all things which were written of the Messiah might be punctually accomplished in him. <span class="ital">Tell ye the daughter of Zion </span>— That is, Jerusalem, so called from mount Zion, which was in the city, and on which was erected a fortress for its defence. This poetical manner of personifying the cities and countries, to which they addressed themselves, was familiar to the prophets. The first words of the passage are cited from <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm" title="Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.">Isaiah 62:11</a>, the rest from <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>. The ancient Jewish doctors were wont to apply these prophecies to the Messiah. <span class="ital">On an ass </span>— The Prince of peace did not take a horse, a warlike animal: but he will ride on that by and by, <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a>. In the patriarchal ages, illustrious persons thought it no disgrace to make use of this animal: but it by no means appears that this opinion prevailed, or this custom continued, till the reign of Tiberius. Was it a mean attitude wherein our Lord then appeared? mean even to contempt? We grant it: we glory in it: it is for the comfort of our souls, for the honour of his humility, and for the utter confusion of all worldly pomp and grandeur. <span class="ital">Upon an ass, and a colt, </span>&c. — “From the other evangelists it would appear that our Lord rode only on the colt; from this passage we should be apt to think that both had been used. But it is not unusual with the sacred authors, when either the nature of the thing spoken of, or the attendant circumstances are sufficient for precluding mistakes, to employ the plural number for the singular.” — Campbell.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All this was done ... - The prophecy here quoted is found in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. It was always, by the Jews, applied to the Messiah.<p>Daughter of Zion - That is, "Jerusalem." "Zion" was one of the hills on which the city of Jerusalem was built. On this stood the city of David and some strong fortresses. The names "daughter and virgin" were given to it often, in accordance with the Oriental figurative manner of expression. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>.

The disciples were sent to the neighbouring village for the ass and colt, and they brought them, and Christ rode upon them; not because of the distance of the place from Jerusalem, for he was just at it; or because he was weary, or it would be very fatiguing to him to walk thither on foot; for he had been used to travelling, and had gone through most parts of Galilee and Judea; but <p>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: the Ethiopic version adds, Isaiah; for the former part of the following citation stands in <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a> as the latter does in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>.

The incident in which Jesus then realized the recognised fulfilment of the prophecy (Hengstenberg, Ewald, Keim) would suggest the strained interpretation of the figure, and quite properly, inasmuch as Christ’s riding into the city revealed the <span class="ital">typical</span> nature of the form in which the prophet embodied his prediction (Düsterdieck, <span class="ital">de rei propheticae natura ethica</span>, 1852, p. 78 f.).

Such is the view of the evangelist and the view he wishes his readers to take. But it does not follow from this that Christ’s whole action proceeded from a conscious intention to fulfil a prophecy. On the contrary, the less intention on His part the greater the apologetic value of the correspondence between prophecy and fact. Action with intention might show that He claimed to be, not that He <span class="ital">was</span>, the Messiah. On the other hand, His right to be regarded as the Messiah would have stood where it was though He had entered Jerusalem on foot. That right cannot stand or fall with any such purely external circumstance, which can at best possess only the value of a symbol of those spiritual qualities which constitute intrinsic fitness for Messiahship. But Jesus, while fully aware of its entirely subordinate importance, might quite conceivably be in the mood to give it the place of a symbol, all the more that the act was in harmony with His whole policy of avoiding display and discouraging vulgar Messianic ideas and hopes. There was no pretentiousness in riding into Jerusalem on the foal of an ass. It was rather the meek and lowly One entering in <span class="ital">character</span>, and in a character not welcome to the proud worldly-minded Jerusalemites. The symbolic act was of a piece with the use of the title “Son of Man,” shunning Messianic pretensions, yet making them in a deeper way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">that it might be fulfilled</span>] See note ch. <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm" title="Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,">Matthew 1:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this was done;</span> <span class="accented">now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) all <span class="accented">this hath come to pass</span>.

This observation of the evangelist is intended to convey the truth that Christ was acting consciously on the lines of old prophecy, working out the will of God declared beforehand by divinely inspired seers. The disciples acted in blind obedience to Christ's command, not knowing that they were thus fulfilling prophecy, or having any such purpose in mind. The knowledge came afterwards (see <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That it might be fulfilled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). The conjuction in this phrase is certainly used in its final, not in a consecutive or ecbatie sense; it denotes the purpose or design of the action of Christ, not the result. Not only the will of the Father, but the words of Scripture, had delineated the life of Christ, and in obeying that will he purposed to show that he fulfilled the prophecies which spake of him. Thus any who knew the Scriptures, and were open to conviction, might see that it was he alone to whom these ancient oracles pointed, and in him alone were their words accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, with a hint of <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>, a quotation being often woven from two or more passages (see on Matthew 27:9). </body></html>
