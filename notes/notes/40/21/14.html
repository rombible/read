They now followed the great Healer into the Temple itself, and sought at His hands relief from their infirmities. If we were to accept the LXX. reading of the strange proverbial saying of <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.

Most commentators give an entirely different meaning to the proverb, and there is no evidence from Jewish writers that the blind and the lame were ever, as a matter of fact, excluded from the Temple. All that we can legitimately infer from the two passages is the contrast between the hasty, passionate words of the conquering king, and the tender compassion of the Son of David, to whom the blind and the lame were objects, not of antipathy, but pity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-17 Christ found some of the courts of the temple turned into a market for cattle and things used in the sacrifices, and partly occupied by the money-changers. Our Lord drove them from the place, as he had done at his entering upon his ministry, Joh 2:13-17. His works testified of him more than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling the promise, that the glory of the latter house should be greater than the glory of the former. If Christ came now into many parts of his visible church, how many secret evils he would discover and cleanse! And how many things daily practised under the cloak of religion, would he show to be more suitable to a den of thieves than to a house of prayer!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said It is written ... - This is written in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>. The first part of this verse only is quoted from Isaiah. The rest - "but ye have made it a den of thieves" - was added by Jesus, denoting their abuse of the temple. Thieves and robbers live in dens and caves. Judea was then much infested with them. In their dens thieves devise and practice iniquity. These buyers and sellers imitated them. They made the temple a place of gain; they cheated and defrauded; they took advantage of the poor, and, by their being under a necessity of purchasing these articles for sacrifice, they "robbed" them by selling what they had at an enormous price.<p>The following reasons may be given why this company of buyers and sellers obeyed Christ:<p>1. They were overawed by his authority, and struck with the consciousness that he had a right to command,<p>2. Their own consciences reproved them; they knew they were guilty, and they dared make no resistance.<p>3. The people generally were then on the side of Jesus, believing him to be the Messiah.<p>4. It had always been the belief of the Jews that a "prophet" had a right to change, regulate, and order the various affairs relating to external worship. They supposed Jesus to be such, and they did not dare to resist him.<p>Mark and Luke add, that in consequence of this, the scribes and chief priests attempted to put him to death, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/11-18.htm">Mark 11:18-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47-48</a>.

This piece of the history is related by two of the other evangelists, but with great difference. Luke before this mentions a discourse upon the way, upon our Saviour’s first sight of the city, and his prophecy of the destruction of it; but no other evangelist mentioning it, I shall pass it over till I come to his history. Mark hath this part of the history thus, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/11-11.htm" title="And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve....">Mark 11:11-19</a></span>, <span class="ital">And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he</span> <span class="ital">had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was</span> <span class="ital">come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. And on the morrow, </span> <span class="ital">when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry.</span> (Then he relates our Saviour’s cursing the barren fig tree, which I leave till I come to it in order). <span class="ital">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into</span> <span class="ital">the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the</span> <span class="ital">temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the</span> <span class="ital">seats of them that sold doves: and would not suffer that any man</span> <span class="ital">should carry any vessel through the temple.

Luke saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/19-45.htm" title="And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;...">Luke 19:45-47</a></span>, <span class="ital">And he went into the temple, and</span> <span class="ital">began to cast out them that sold therein, and those that bought; </span> <span class="ital">saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer:</span> <span class="ital">but ye have made it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the</span> <span class="ital">temple.</span> It is plain by all the evangelists, that our Saviour, coming to Jerusalem five days before the passover, went every night to Bethany, about two miles off, and returned in the morning to the temple, where Luke saith that he taught daily. The first day it should seem, by Mark, that he only came into the temple, looked round about upon all things, and with the twelve went out to lodge at Bethany. By his going into the temple, we must understand only the outward court, for the priests and Levites only might enter into the inner court, and the holy place; and the high priest only might enter into the holiest of all. Though Mark mentions not his driving out the buyers and sellers the first day, but recites it as if it had been done the second day of his coming, yet the best interpreters think that it was done the first day, as Matthew and Luke seem to hint; nor is any thing more usual, than for the evangelists to set down things out of the order of time in which they were done. Some learned authors in the Hebrew learning tell us, that in the outward court was a daily market of such things as the Jews used for sacrifices, wine salt, oil, oxen, and sheep; but it being but three or four days before the passover, the market was much greater, because of the great multitude of lambs then to be used. By the law, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>,15</span>, every one also was to bring a half shekel. For this purpose there were tables of moneychangers, men that were furnished with half Shekels to change with the people, that every one might have his half shekel; and those that so changed allowed some little profit to those that changed their money, which gain was called kollubistai; thence the changers were called dollubistai, <span class="ital">money changers.</span> Those that <span class="ital">sold doves</span> were there, to furnish the women that came up to their purification with their offerings, according to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm" title="And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:">Leviticus 12:6</a></span>. This was the reason of that great market which our Lord found in the outward court of the temple; and it is not likely that our Lord should see these abuses the first day and take no notice of them, but come the next day and correct them, which makes interpreters think Mark in this relation postponed this part of the history. Here arise two questions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Whether it was unlawful for them to sell these things in that part of the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Admit it were, By what authority did our Saviour do this? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To the first it must be said, That had it not been unlawful, our Saviour would not have reproved them for turning his Father’s house, and the house of prayer, into a place of merchandise; nor would he have driven them out in such a zeal, overturning the tables, &c., which he had done also once before, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/2-15.htm" title="And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;">John 2:15</a></span>. The temple was built by God’s direction, not only dedicated by men, but God’s acceptation of it was testified. It appeareth by <span class="bld"><a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a></span>, it was a type of Christ’s body. We know there were special promises made to those that did pray toward it. God saith he had <span class="ital">hallowed</span> it, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.">1 Kings 9:3</a></span>; that is, separated it from common use to his service, amongst other things for a <span class="ital">house of prayer, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a></span>. Now though we read of no other things sold there but what were useful for sacrifices, yet this was a civil use, and a profanation of that holy place, because there were market places in Jerusalem, in which these things might have been done. It had been against decency, if the temple had not been hallowed in this manner, if such things had been done in the synagogues, being places set apart and commonly used for God’s worship; but to use the temple in this manner, so specially hallowed, was doubtless a great profanation of that holy place. As to the second question, By what authority our Lord, being no public magistrate, did these things, I am not so posed to determine that, he being the eternal Son of God, and now in the exercise of his regal power, as I am to give an account how it came to pass that the priests, and scribes, and Pharisees never questioned him for what he did; for if any will say, that we presently shall read of their taking counsel against him, I reply, But we read of nothing relating to this laid to his charge. Nor do we read of their questioning him when he did the same things before, an account of which we have in <span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem....">John 2:13-25</a></span>. For though I know some say that our Saviour did this <span class="ital">Jure zelotarum:</span> that the Jews had a law, that any might punish even to death such as profaned the worship or holy things of God; which they justify from <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/13-9.htm" title="But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.">Deu 13:9</a></span>, and the examples of Phinehas killing Zimri and Cozbi, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/numbers/25-6.htm" title="And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation....">Numbers 25:6-8</a></span>, and Mattaniah’s killing the Jew sacrificing to idols at Modin, and the king’s commissioner, of which we read in <span class="bld">/Apc <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-24.htm" title="For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty which they find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for the variety of the matter,">2Ma 2:24</a>,25</span>: yet this doth no way give me any satisfaction: for as, on the one side, I should not have known how to have defended the act of Phinehas if God had not by and by justified him, nor do I think that the law in <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/13-9.htm" title="But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.">Deu 13:9</a></span> is to be expounded of private persons; so, on the other side, if the priests, and scribes, and Pharisees had not known of some law that justified our Saviour in this act, I can hardly conceive they would have so quietly put it up, especially considering that probably their profit was concerned, if they had for gain licensed those traders to a place within the compass of the temple, as is very probable. Being therefore fully satisfied that our Saviour, who was Lord of the temple, and to whom the Spirit was given without measure, did no more than he might lawfully do, I am willingly ignorant how it came to pass that he met with no opposition in it, because God hath not pleased in his word to inform us. It is certain that he did the thing, and that it was a thing fit to be done, and that he, as the Son of God, had authority to do it; what made them take it so quietly I cannot tell, nor is it necessary for us to know, nor of any great advantage. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the blind and the lame came to him,....

II. p. 118), but only to bear in mind that, as a genuine poet, the psalmist seemed to hear, in the noise and prattle of the <span class="ital">babes</span> and <span class="ital">sucklings</span>, a celebration of their Maker’s praise.

This notice is peculiar to St. Matthew, though St. Luke (<a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>) mentions that "he taught daily in the temple." An old expositor has remarked that Christ first as King purified his palace, and then took his seat therein, and of his royal bounty distributed gilts to his people. It was a new fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4-6</a>), which spake of Messiah coming to open the eyes of the blind, to unstop the ears of the deaf, to make the lame man leap as an hart. For acts of sacrilege which profaned the temple precincts, he substituted acts of mercy which hallowed them; the good Physician takes the place of the greedy trafficker; the den of thieves becomes a beneficent hospital. How many were the acts of healing, we are not told; but the words point to the relief of numberless sufferers, none of whom were sent empty away. </body></html>
