To them this was a strange prelude to the usual order of the feast, and they asked what it meant. The answer fell short of the full meaning of the shouts of the people, but it expressed that aspect of the character of Jesus which was most intelligible to strangers. He was “the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved - There was great excitement.

The metropolis of the nation, the seat of the ancient kings of Judah, and of his father David, entering into it in this very public manner; as he never did before; riding in the manner the ancient judges and kings of Israel did, attended with a numerous retinue, shouting as they went along, and singing their "Hosannas" to him: <p>all the city was moved; as Bethlehem was, when Naomi with Ruth returned thither; and of which the same phrase is used, as here, <a href="/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a>. <p>all the city was moved about them; which the Chaldee paraphrase renders, <p>"all the inhabitants of the city were gathered in troops about them.'' <p>And so here the sense is, that the inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem were in general alarmed at the uncommon apparatus, and shouting, and ran in great numbers to inquire what was the matter: <p>saying, who is this? They knew him not; for though he had preached unto them, and wrought miracles among them, yet they had never seen him in any such pomp and state; and could not devise who he should be, that entered their city in such a manner, amidst the shouts and acclamations of so great a multitude: it seemed greatly to affect them, and fill them with concern, astonishment, and fear. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he was come into Jerusalem, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</span><p>(g) That is, all the men of Jerusalem were moved.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-10.htm" title="And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?">Matthew 21:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐσείσθη</span>: even Jerusalem, frozen with religious formalism and socially undemonstrative, was stirred by the popular enthusiasm as by a mighty wind or by an earthquake (<span class="greekheb">σεισμός</span>), and asked (<a href="/matthew/21-11.htm" title="And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.">Matthew 21:11</a>), <span class="greekheb">τίς οὗτος</span>;—<span class="greekheb">ὁ προφήτης</span>, etc.: a circumstantial answer specifying name, locality, and vocation; not a low-pitched answer as Chrys.

On the tenth of this month the Paschal lamb was selected and taken up preparatory to its sacrifice four days after (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). So the true Paschal Lamb now is escorted to the place where alone the Passover could be sacrificed. Taking A.D.  to be the date of the Crucifixion, astronomers inform us that in that year the first day of Nisan fell on March 24. Consequently, the tenth would be on Sunday, April 2, and the fourteenth was reckoned item sunset of Thursday, April 6, to the sunset of Friday, April 7 (see on ver. 1, and preliminary note ch. 26.). <span class="cmt_word">Was moved</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">was shaken</span>, as by an earthquake. St. Matthew alone mentions this commotion, though St. John (<a href="/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>) makes allusion to it, when he reports the vindictive exclamation of the Pharisees, "Behold, the world is gone after him!" Jerusalem had been stirred and troubled once before, when the Wise Men walked through the streets, inquiring, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" (<a href="/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2, 3</a>). But the excitement was far greater now, more general, composed of many different elements. The Romans expected some public rising; the Pharisaical party was aroused to new envy and malice; the Herodians dreaded a possible usurper; but the populace entertained for the moment the idea that their hopes were now fulfilled, that the long desired Messiah had at last appeared, and would lead them to victory. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this?</span> The question may have been put by the strangers who came from all parts of the world to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem, or by the crowds in the streets, when they beheld the unusual procession that was advancing. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was moved (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>Moved is hardly strong enough.
