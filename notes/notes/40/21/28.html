I will plainly tell you my judgment of it, which is very naturally connected with the present subject.

The spirit and conduct of the second son was an exact picture of the temper and behaviour of the Pharisees; for in their prayers and praises they gave God the most honourable titles, and professed the greatest readiness and zeal in his service: but it was a bare profession, contradicted by all their actions. They said, <span class="ital">I go, sir, </span>to work in thy vineyard, <span class="ital">but went not. </span>Jesus having finished his parable, asked, <span class="ital">Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? </span>— Without hesitation, they replied, <span class="ital">The first </span>— Not perceiving that by this answer they condemned themselves, till Jesus, making a direct application of the parable, gave them that sharp but just rebuke; <span class="ital">Verily I say unto you </span>— Even the most abandoned sinners of the age, such as <span class="ital">the publicans and harlots, go into the kingdom of God before you </span>— Are much more open to conviction, and more readily obey the gospel than you. <span class="ital">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness </span>— Walking in it as well as teaching it, and gave evident proofs of his mission from God; <span class="ital">and ye believed him not</span> — Gave no credit to the testimony which he bare to me, nor received his doctrine, and consequently would not enter the vineyard: <span class="ital">but the publicans and harlots — </span>The most notorious sinners; <span class="ital">believed him </span>— Were reformed, and obeyed the gospel, though at first they said, <span class="ital">I will not.

The parable of the two sons sent to work in the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism to be of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The whole human race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but they have rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in their disobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebel is brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while the formalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But what think ye? - A way of speaking designed to direct them particularly to what he was saying, that they might be self-convicted.<p>Two sons - By those two sons our Lord intends to represent the conduct of the Jews, and that of the publicans and sinners.<p>In my vineyard - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>.

See Gill on <a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>. <p>a certain man had two sons. This is a parable; the design of which is to show the hypocrisy and deceit of the Scribes and Pharisees, in pretending to works of righteousness, and not doing them; and to reprove them for their disbelief and rejection of John's ministry; and to make it appear, that the worst of sinners in the Jewish nation were preferable to them; and that many of them were, and would be, happy, when they would be miserable. By the "certain man", in the parable, God is designed; who, though he is not a man, nor to be represented by any human form; yet, as man is the image of God, he is therefore, in an improper and figurative sense, compared to man, and set forth by him; which may be allowed in a metaphorical and parabolical way: and though the Son of God only assumed human nature, and really became man; yet God, the Father, seems rather to be here intended, who is sometimes compared to a husbandman and a vinedresser; see <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a> and as appears from the relation of the "two sons" unto him; by whom are meant not Jews and Gentiles; for the latter can never be intended by the first son; for these were not sons in such sense as the Jews were, nor were upon an equal foot of sonship with them, as the parable supposes; much less were they called first, and bid to work in the vineyard: but, on the contrary John the Baptist, Christ, and his apostles, were first, and only sent to the Jews; and God, as yet, was not come even in the external ministry of the word to the Gentiles; nor were they brought to repentance and obedience: but by them are meant two sorts of people, among the Jews, the Scribes and Pharisees, and publicans and sinners; as the application of the parable, by our Lord himself, most clearly shows: these were both the sons of God; not only by creation, as all men are, all having, in this sense, but one common father, whose offspring they be; but also by national adoption; for to all, who were Israelites, according to the flesh, whether good men, or bad men, alike belonged the general privilege of adoption, <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>. This publicans and sinners had an equal right to, as well as the Scribes and Pharisees, though they were not all the sons of God by special grace, or spiritual adoption: <p>and he came to the first; the publicans and sinners among the Jews, by the ministry of John the Baptist, Christ, and his disciples, who first and chiefly preached to such sort of persons, <p>and said, son, go work today in my vineyard: by the "vineyard", is meant the kingdom of God, or of heaven, the Gospel church state, the then present dispensation of things, which was set up, and which men were called to embrace and enter into; the doors of which the Pharisees, who pretended to have the key of knowledge, did all they could to shut up, and hinder persons going in, as they refused to do themselves: this is called it a "vineyard"; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1</a>. To work in it signifies to hear the word preached, to believe in the Messiah, embrace his doctrines, and submit to his ordinances, particularly the ordinance of baptism, which was the then principal ordinance of that dispensation. The time of working in it is "today"; directly, immediately, and whilst it is day; for the hour cometh when no man can work, and when all these means and ordinances will be at an end, and attending on them will be over: the argument used to engage hereunto, is taken from the relation the person stood in as a "son", highly favoured by God, with the blessing of national adoption, besides that of natural sonship common to all mankind. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But what think ye?

Amiat. (the oldest existing), and Fuld. and Forojuliensis of the Vulg. However Jerome, though editing, as appears from his commentary, ‘novissimus,’ yet states that good copies have ‘primus’ (<span class="greekheb">ὁ πρῶτος</span>): <span class="ital">c</span> also, and some less ancient copies of the Vulg., agree with Rec. Text, <span class="greekheb">ὁ πρῶτος</span>. But Hil. 717 has ‘junior.’ The <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὕστερος</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἔσχατος</span>, as being the <span class="ital">more difficult</span> reading, would be more likely to be changed by a corrector into <span class="greekheb">ὁ πρῶτος</span>, than <span class="ital">vice versa</span>. Jerome vii. 168<span class="ital">e</span> explains the former reading, ‘novissimus,’ thus:—“The Jews understood the truth, but shrunk back, and would not say what they thought; just as, though knowing the baptism of John to be from heaven, they would not acknowledge in words that it was so.” They did not like, I think, to repeat again the same reply as before in <a href="/matthew/21-27.htm" title="And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.">Matthew 21:27</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ οἴδαμεν</span>, therefore they doggedly, in spite of convictions, replied, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὕστερος</span>. However, the words, <span class="greekheb">Λέγουσιν ὁ ὕστερος</span>: <span class="greekheb">λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰνσοῦς</span>, seem to be an interpolation: for Origen, who seldom passes over difficult passages, takes no notice of these words; and besides, <span class="greekheb">ὕστερος</span> as an adjective, is found nowhere in the New Testament except in <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the two sons</span>.

By this and the succeeding parables, Jesus shows his interlocutors their true guilty position and the punishment that awaited them. He himself explains the present parable in reference to his hearers, though, of course, it has, and is meant to have, a much wider application. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a man</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had two sons.</span> The man represents God; the two sons symbolize two classes of Jews - the Pharisees, with their followers and imitators; and the lawless and sinful, who made no pretence of religion. The former are those who profess to keep the Law strictly, to the very letter, though they care nothing for its spirit, and virtually divorce religion from morality The latter are careless and profane persons, whom the Lord calls "publicans and harlots" (ver. 31). <span class="cmt_word">The first.</span> Westcott and Hort, relying on no very weighty authority, reverse the order of the sons' answers, altering ver. 31 in agreement with this arrangement. Christ's reply countenances the received text, setting the repentant before the professing son. It is a matter of small importance (see Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). "The first son "here typifies the evil and immoral among the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>, <span class="accented">work</span> <span class="cmt_word">today.</span> Two emphatic imperatives.

He called them by the prophets, and more especially by John the Baptist, to turn from evil ways, and to do works meet for repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). Christ gives two examples, showing how this call was received. </body></html>
