(1.) As here, “Hosanna.” The word was a Hebrew imperative, “Save us, we beseech thee,” and had come into liturgical use from Psalms 118. That Psalm belonged specially to the Feast of Tabernacles (see Perowne on Psalms 118), and as such, was naturally associated with the palm-branches; the verses from it now chanted by the people are said to have been those with which the inhabitants of Jerusalem were wont to welcome the pilgrims who came up to keep the feast. The addition of “Hosanna to the Son of David” made it a direct recognition of the claims of Jesus to be the Christ; that of “Hosanna in the highest” (comp. <a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>) claimed heaven as in accord with earth in this recognition. (2.) “Blessed be” (“the King” in St. Luke) “He that cometh in the name of the Lord.” These words, too, received a special personal application. The welcome was now given, not to the crowd of pilgrims, but to the King. (3.) As in St. Luke, one of the cries was an echo of the angels’ hymn at the Nativity, “Peace on earth, and glory in the highest” (<a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>). (4.) As in St. Mark, “Blessed be the kingdom of our father David.” We have to think of these shouts as filling the air as He rides slowly on in silence. He will not check them at the bidding of the Pharisees (<a href="/luke/19-39.htm" title="And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke your disciples.">Luke 19:39</a>), but His own spirit is filled with quite other thoughts than theirs. And those who watched Him saw the tears streaming down His cheeks as He looked on the walls and towers of the city, and heard, what the crowds manifestly did not hear, His lamentation over its coming fall (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest....">Matthew 21:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the multitude that went before, and that followed </span>— In this triumphal procession, <span class="ital">cried, saying </span>— Probably from a divine impulse; for certainly most of them understood not the words they uttered, <span class="ital">Hosanna</span> — (<span class="ital">Lord, save us,</span>) which was a solemn word in frequent use among the Jews. The meaning is, “We sing Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he, the Messiah, of the Lord. Save, thou that art in the highest heavens.” Our Lord restrained all public tokens of honour from the people till now, lest the envy of his enemies should interrupt his preaching before the time. But this reason now ceasing, he suffered their acclamations, that they might be a public testimony against their wickedness, who, in four or five days after, cried out, Crucify him, crucify him. The expressions recorded by the other evangelists are somewhat different from these: but all of them were undoubtedly used by some or others of the multitude. <span class="ital">And all the city</span> <span class="ital">was moved </span>— Was in a great commotion at so uncommon an appearance, <span class="ital">saying, Who is this? </span>— That comes in all this pomp, and is attended with these high congratulations <span class="ital">And the multitude </span>— Namely, that came along with him, <span class="ital">said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth </span>— What a stumbling- block was this! If he was of Nazareth? he could not be the Messiah. But they who earnestly desired to know the truth would not stumble thereat: for, upon inquiry, (which such would not fail to make,) they would find, he was not of Nazareth, but Bethlehem. Thus Sion’s king comes to Sion; and the daughter of Sion had notice of his coming long before; and yet he is not attended by the great ones of the country, nor met by the magistrates of the city in their formalities, as might have been expected. The keys of the city are not presented to him, nor is he conducted, as he ought to have been, with all possible ceremony, to <span class="ital">the thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David, </span><a href="/psalms/122-5.htm" title="For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.">Psalm 122:5</a>. Here is nothing of all this: yet he has his attendants; and those a very great multitude. But alas! they are only the common people (the rabble, we should have been apt to call them) that grace the solemnity of Christ’s triumph. The chief priests and elders are not among them. We find them afterward, indeed, intermixed with the multitude that reviled him when he hung on the cross, but none of them are here joining with the multitude that did him honour! Ye see, here, your calling, brethren; <span class="ital">not many mighty, or noble, </span>attend on Christ; but <span class="ital">the foolish things of the world, and base things, and things that are despised. </span>Such is what has been termed <span class="ital">the triumph of Christ! </span>But what sort of a triumph is it? Not like the triumphs of the potentates and conquerors of the world: but the triumph of humility, self-denial, meekness, and love, over the pride, vain glory, ambition, and selfishness of carnal and worldly- minded men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hosanna to the son of David ... - The word "hosanna" means "save now," or "save, I beseech thee." It is a Syriac word, and was a form of acclamation used among the Jews. It was probably used in the celebration of their great festivals. During those festivals they sang <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116.htm">Psalm 116</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1-2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>. In the chanting or singing of those psalms, the Jewish writers inform us that the people responded frequently "hallelujah, or hosanna." Their use of it on this occasion was a joyful acclamation, and an invocation of a divine blessing by the "Messiah."<p>Son of David - The Messiah.<p>Blessed be he ... - That is, blessed be the "Messiah This passage is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25-26</a>. To come "in the name of the Lord" here means to come "by the authority" of the Lord, or to come "commissioned" by him to reveal his will. The Jews had commonly applied this to the Messiah.<p>Hosanna in the highest - This may mean either "Hosanna in the highest, loftiest strains," or it may be for a prayer to God "Save now, O thou that dwellest in the highest heaven, or among the highest angels." Perhaps the whole song of hosanna may be a prayer to the Supreme God, as well as a note of triumphant acclamation: "Save now, O thou supremely great and glorious God; save by the Messiah that comes in thy name."<p>Mark adds that they shouted, "Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord." That is, the kingdom "promised" to David, <a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>. "Coming in the name" of the Lord here evidently means coming according to the "promise" of the Lord. The sense may be thus expressed: "Prosperity to the reign of our father David, advancing now according to the promise made to him, and about to be established by the long predicted Messiah, his descendant."<p>Luke adds <a href="/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a> that they said, "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest." The word "peace" is used here as significant of joy, triumph, exultation at this event. There will be increased peace and rejoicing in heaven from the accession of the redeemed: there will be augmented glory - new songs of praise "among the highest angels."<p>There is no contradiction here among the evangelists. Among such a multitude, the shouts of exultation and triumph would by no means be confined to the same words. Some would say one thing and some another; and one evangelist recorded what was said by a part of the multitude, and another what was said by another part. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>Mt 21:1-9.

And in a kind of a natural country triumph, made up without any kind of art, some threw their clothes in his way, some cut down boughs of trees, (<span class="ital">palm</span> <span class="ital">trees</span>, saith John), with these they bestrew the way. Christ at Bethany, in his journey, had done a famous miracle, raising up Lazarus from the dead. John saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/12-18.htm" title="For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.">John 12:18</a></span>, the fame of this made many that were in Jerusalem, who were come thither against the passover time, (for, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a></span>, it was but <span class="ital">six days before the</span> <span class="ital">passover</span>), go out to meet him; and, joined with those who came along with him from Bethany, they cried all along as they came, <span class="ital">Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name</span> <span class="ital">of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. Blessed be the kingdom of our</span> <span class="ital">father David. Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> Many of these expressions, seem to be taken out of <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/118-24.htm" title="This is the day which the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it....">Psalm 118:24-26</a></span>. Their laying the garments upon the ass, and throwing them in the way, was a custom they used towards princes, as appears not only by many records out of profane authors, but from <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm" title="Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.">2 Kings 9:13</a></span>, where the like was done to Jehu, upon his being anointed king over Israel. For the acclamations, they were also such as were usual to princes. Whether <span class="ital">Hosanna</span> signifieth, <span class="ital">Save now, </span> or, Help, we pray; or whether it was a term by which they expressed their desire of good success or prosperity to the person to whom they applied it; or whether it was the name of some song used in their festivals, or it signifies boughs, &c., is not much material: they by this acclamation acknowledged him a King, the Son of David; they blessed him, they wished him peace, honour, and glory. This was the acclamation of the multitude, who doubtless had but a small and imperfect knowledge of the Divine nature of Christ, but yet looked on him as the Son of David, as the Messiah. The Pharisees (some of which it seemeth had mixed themselves with this multitude) were troubled at the acclamation, and (as Luke tells us) speak to Christ to rebuke them; but he answereth, <span class="ital">If these should</span> <span class="ital">hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span> It is a proverbial expression, the sense of which is alone to be attended. The sense is this: The time is come, set by my Father for the publication of my kingdom, and declaring what I am; and when God’s time is come the thing must come to pass, by one means or another. If these children of Abraham should hold their peace, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham, and they should do the same thing, publish me as the Son of David, the King in Zion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the multitudes that went before,.... That is, that went before Christ; accordingly the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel, read, "that went before him": these seem to be the much people that met him from Jerusalem, <p>and that followed him; which were perhaps those that came from Jericho, and other parts; <p>cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: by calling Jesus the Son of David, they owned and proclaimed him to be the Messiah; this being the usual title by which the Messiah was known among the Jews; see the note on <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a> and by crying and saying Hosanna to him, which was done with loud acclamations, and the united shouts of both companies, before and behind; they ascribe all praise, honour, glory, and blessing to him, and wish him all prosperity, happiness, and safety. The word is an Hebrew word, and is compounded of  and  which signifies, "save I beseech"; and which words stand in <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25</a> to which the multitude had reference, as appears from what follows; and are formed into one word,  "Hosana", or "Hosanna", in which form it frequently appears in the Jewish writings; and because of the often use of it at the feast of tabernacles, that feast was called "Hosanna", and the seventh day of it was called  "the great Hosanna" (d). Moreover, the "Lulabs", or the bundles made of branches of palm trees, and boughs of willow and myrtle, which they carried in their hands at the feast of tabernacles, often go by this name: it is said (e), <p>"the Egyptian myrtle is right or fit  "for the Hosanna".'' <p>That is, to be put into the "Lulab", or bundle of boughs and branches, which was carried about, and shaken at the above feast. Again (f), <p>"it is a tradition of R. Meir, that it was the practice of the honourable men of Jerusalem, to bind their "Lulabs" with golden threads says Rabbah, these are they , "that bind the Hosanna": the gloss on it is, "that bind the Lulabs", of the house of the head of the captivity; for in binding the Hosanna of the house of the head of the captivity, they leave in it an hand's breadth and says the same Rabbah, a man may not hold an Hosanna in a linen cloth.'' <p>Once more (g), <p>"says R. Zera, a man may not prepare  "an Hosanna" for a child, on a good day.'' <p>Sometimes the Hosanna seems to be distinguished from the "Lulab", and then by the "Lulab" is meant, only the branches of palm tree; and by the Hosanna, the boughs of willow and myrtle; as when (h), <p>"Rabbah says, a man may not fix the "Lulab",  "in the Hosanna".'' <p>And a little after says the same, <p>"a man may not bind the "Lulab" with the "Hosanna".'' <p>Now these bundles might be so called, because they were lifted up and shaken, when the above words out of <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25</a> were recited: for thus it is said (i), <p>"when do they shake, that is, their "Lulabs", or "Hosannas?" At those words, "O give thanks unto the Lord", <a href="/psalms/118-1.htm">Psalm 118:1</a> the beginning and end; and at those words, "Save now I beseech thee", <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25</a>. The house of Hillell, and the house of Shammai say also at those words, "O Lord I beseech thee, send now prosperity": says R. Akiba, I have observed Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua, that all the people shook their Lulabs, but they did not shake, only at those words, Save now I beseech thee, O Lord.'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Hosanna to the Son of David: <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</span><p>(e) This was an ancient kind of cry, which they voiced in the feast of Tabernacles, when they carried boughs according as God commanded; Le 23:40.

The excitement was contagious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ προφήτης</span>] the well-known prophet. The crowds that accompanied Him had, in most explicit terms, designated Him the Messiah; but the less interested people of the city wished above all to ascertain His name and rank. Hence the full reply, <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς</span> … <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλ</span>., in which the <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀπὸ Ναζαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλ</span>. doubtless betrays somewhat of the Galilean consciousness of the multitude, inasmuch as it was for most part composed of Galileans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The triumphal entry of Jesus is not a final attempt to establish the Messianic kingdom in a political sense <span class="ital">(Wolfenb. Fragm.)</span>, such a kingdom having been entirely foreign to His purpose and His function. It is rather to be regarded as His last public and solemn appearance as the Messiah,—an appearance which, coming as it did immediately before His passion, was on the one hand a matter of deep personal interest because of the necessary bearing it was felt to have upon the mission of His life; while, if taken in connection with what happened so soon after, it was calculated, on the other hand, to destroy all expectations of a merely political kind. The time was now come when Jesus felt that, just because He <span class="ital">was</span> the Messiah, it <span class="ital">behoved</span> Him to do something—and for this He appropriates the prophet’s symbol of the Prince of Peace—by way of contrast to His practice hitherto of forbidding the publication of His Messiahship. This step, which, from the fact of the crisis being so near, might now be taken without risk, He had postponed till the eve of His death,—a circumstance of the utmost significance as regarded the sense in which His Messiahship was to be understood. <span class="ital">This</span> incident, too, was one of the things for which His hour had not previously come (<a href="/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>).

According to Wittichen, <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. D. Theol</span>. 1862, p. 365, Jesus did not intend this incident to be regarded in any other light than as an ordinary <span class="ital">festival procession</span>, but the multitude, <span class="ital">without consulting Him</span>, turned it into an occasion for a Messianic demonstration. This is not in keeping with the unusual preparations mentioned in <a href="/matthew/21-2.htm" title="Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.">Matthew 21:2</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ὄχλοι</span>: the crowd divided into two, one in front, one in rear, Jesus between.—<span class="greekheb">ἔκραζον</span>: lip homage followed the carpeting of the way, in words borrowed from the Psalter (<a href="/context/psalms/118-25.htm" title="Save now, I beseech you, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech you, send now prosperity....">Psalm 118:25-26</a>), and variously interpreted by commentators.—<span class="greekheb">Ὡσαννὰ τῷ υἱῷ Δ</span>.

All this homage by deed and word speaks to a great enthusiasm, the outcome of the Galilean ministry; for the crowd consists of Galileans. Perhaps the incident at Jericho, the healing of the blind men, and the vociferated title Son of David with which they saluted the Healer, gave the keynote. A little matter moves a crowd when it happens at the right moment.

The multitude recognise the Messiah in Jesus and address to Him the strains of their most joyous festival. St Luke paraphrases the expression for his Gentile readers, “glory in the highest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord</span>] (<a href="/psalms/118-26.htm" title="Blessed be he that comes in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.">Psalm 118:26</a>). “He that cometh” (<span class="ital">Habba</span>) was a recognised Messianic title. St Mark and St John add “Blessed be the kingdom of our father, David (‘the king of Israel,’ John), that cometh in the name of the Lord.” St Luke has “Blessed be the king that cometh,” &c., and mentions that the multitude began to rejoice and praise God <span class="ital">with a loud voice</span> for all the mighty works that they had seen.” These shouts of triumph—which are the “gospel” or heralding of the King—must have sounded across the valley of Kedron up to the precincts and porches of the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Bethany stands in a shallow hollow scooped out of the shoulder of the hill. The path follows this till the descent begins at a turn where the first view of the Temple is caught.

It was a culminating outburst of feeling. It is clear that the expectation of the kingdom was raised to the highest pitch.

Agreeable to the account given by the Evangelists of our Lord’s entry, is that which Isidore Clarius says that he heard from a certain Jew, viz., that these words, “<span class="ital">Hosanna! Blessed is He that cometh</span>,” etc., were customarily said by the priests, when victims were offered for sacrifice. And the formula, Hosanna, was so frequently uttered, that they even gave that name to the branches which were carried about on the Feast of Tabernacles.[914]—<span class="greekheb">εὑλογημένος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">blessed</span>, etc.) Thus the LXX. in Psalms 118(117):26, which psalm formed part of the <span class="ital">Hallel</span>, or Paschal hymn, which they would have to recite in a few days’ time.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀνόματι</span>, <span class="ital">in the name</span>) These words should be construed with <span class="greekheb">εὐλογημένος</span>, (<span class="ital">blessed</span>), according to the Hebrew accents.[915]—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις</span>, <span class="ital">in the highest</span>) Succour [us], O Thou who art in the highest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[913] <span class="greekheb">οἱ προάγοντες</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἀκολουθοῦντες</span>, <span class="ital">that went before—and that followed</span>) Of whom <span class="ital">the former</span> had gone from the city to meet Him; <span class="ital">the latter</span> had gathered themselves together to Jesus, either at Jericho or elsewhere, as He was passing along.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[914] Hartwell Horne says on this subject: “During the continuance of this feast, they carried in their hands branches of palm trees, olives, citrons, myrtles, and willows (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm" title="And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.">Leviticus 23:40</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm" title="And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.">Nehemiah 8:15</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/10-7.htm" title="Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good success in cleansing his place.">2Ma 10:7</a>); singing, <span class="ital">Hosanna, save I beseech thee</span> (<a href="/psalms/118-25.htm" title="Save now, I beseech you, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech you, send now prosperity.">Psalm 118:25</a>); in which words they prayed for the coming of the Messiah. These branches also bore the name of Hosanna, as well as all the days of the Feast. In the same manner was Jesus Christ conducted into Jerusalem by the believing Jews, who, considering Him to be the promised Messiah, expressed their boundless joy at finding in Him the accomplishment of those petitions which they had so often offered to God for His coming, at the Feast of Tabernacles. (<a href="/context/matthew/21-8.htm" title="And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way....">Matthew 21:8-9</a>.) During its continuance, they walked in procession round the altar with the above-mentioned branches in their hands, amid the sound of trumpets, singing Hosanna; and on the last, or seventh day of the Feast, they compassed the altar seven times. This was called the Great Hosanna. To this last ceremony St John probably alludes in <a href="/context/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;...">Revelation 7:9-10</a>, where he describes the saints as standing before the Throne, “<span class="ital">clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and saying, Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</span>”—(I.

These expressions point to two separate bodies, which combined in escorting Jesus at a certain portion of the route. We learn from St. John (<a href="/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18</a>) that much people, greatly excited by the news of the raising of Lazarus, when they heard that he was in the neighbourhood, hurried forth from Jerusalem to meet and do him honour. These, when they met the other procession with Jesus riding in the midst, turned back again and preceded him into the city. St. Luke identifies the spot as "at the descent of the Mount of Olives." "As they approached the shoulder of the hill," says Dr. Geikie ('The Life of Christ,' 2:397), "where the road bends downwards to the north, the sparse vegetation of the eastern slope changed, as in a moment, to the rich green of garden and trees, and Jerusalem in its glory rose before them. It is hard for us to imagine now the splendour of the view. The city of God, seated on her hills, shone at the moment in the morning sun. Straight before stretched the vast white walls and buildings of the temple, its courts glittering with gold, rising one above the other; the steep sides of the hill of David crowned with lofty walls; the mighty castles towering above them; the sumptuous palace of Herod in its green parks; and the picturesque outlines of the streets." <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna to the Son of David!</span> "Hosanna!" is compounded of two words meaning "save" and "now," or, "I pray," and is written in full <span class="accented">Hoshia-na</span>, translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>. The expressions uttered by the people are mostly derived from <a href="/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, which formed part of the great Hallel (<a href="/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>.) sung at the Feast of Tabernacles. "Hosanna!" was originally a formula of prayer and supplication, but later became a term of joy and congratulation. So here the cry signifies "Blessings on [or, 'Jehovah bless'] the Son of David!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Messiah, acknowledging Jesus to be he, the promised Prince of David's line. Thus we say, "God save the king!" This, which Ewald calls the first Christian hymn, gave to Palm Sunday, in some parts of the Church, the name of the "day of Hosannas," and was incorporated into the liturgical service both in East and West. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed...  of the Lord:</span> (<a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>). The formula is taken in two ways, the words, "ill the Name of the Lord," being connected either with "blessed" or with "cometh." In the former case the cry  signifies, "The blessing of Jehovah rest on him who cometh!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, Messiah (<a href="/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); in the latter, the meaning is, "Blessing on him who cometh with Divine mission, sent with the authority of Jehovah!" The second interpretation seems to be correct. <span class="cmt_word">In the highest</span> (comp. <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). The people cry to God to ratify in heaven the blessing which they invoke on earth. This homage and the title of Messiah Jesus now accepts as his due, openly asserting his claims, and by his acquiescence encouraging the excitement. St. Matthew omits the touching scene of Christ's lamentations over Jerusalem, as he passed the spot where Roman legions would, a generation hence, encamp against the doomed city. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hosanna<p>O save! </body></html>
