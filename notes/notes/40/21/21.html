The phrase to “remove mountains” (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1Corinthians 13:2</a>) was a natural hyperbole for overcoming difficulties, and our Lord in pointing to “this mountain”—as He had done before to Hermon (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>)—did but give greater vividness to an illustration which the disciples would readily understand. A mere physical miracle, such as the removal of the mountain, could never be in itself the object of the prayer of a faith such as our Lord described. The hyperbole is used here, as elsewhere, to impress on men’s mind the truth which lies beneath it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:18-22 This cursing of the barren fig-tree represents the state of hypocrites in general, and so teaches us that Christ looks for the power of religion in those who profess it, and the savour of it from those that have the show of it. His just expectations from flourishing professors are often disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds leaves only. A false profession commonly withers in this world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse. The fig-tree that had no fruit, soon lost its leaves. This represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in particular. Our Lord Jesus found among them nothing but leaves. And after they rejected Christ, blindness and hardness grew upon them, till they were undone, and their place and nation rooted up. The Lord was righteous in it.

To remove a mountain denotes the power of surmounting or removing any difficulty. The phrase was so used by the Jews. There is no doubt that this was "literally" true - that if "they had the faith of miracles," they could remove the mountain before them - the Mount of Olives - for this was as easy for God to do by them as to heal the sick or raise the dead. But the Saviour rather referred, probably, to the difficulties and trials which they would be called to endure in preaching the gospel.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 21:10-22.

His disciples wondering at his power, in causing the fig tree to wither so suddenly: <p>verily I say unto you, if ye have faith; that is, in God, in his power, which reaches to all things: the object of faith is expressed in Mark, and by way of exhortation, "have faith in God", that he will enable you to perform whatsoever ye shall desire; which must be understood, not of spiritual faith in the promises of God, and person of Christ, but of, the faith of miracles, or faith in the power of God to perform things that are above the strength of nature: <p>and doubt not; either of the power, or will of God to do for you, and by you, the thing desired; for this kind of faith would not admit of the least degree of doubting: there must be no hesitation in the mind, no reasoning upon the thing, how it can be performed; the mind must not be divided between the power and will of God, and the difficulties and discouragements which attend the case, but must believe in hope against hope, with a full persuasion of accomplishment: for want of this faith, without doubting, the disciples could not cure the child that was lunatic. <p>Ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree; cause one to be dried up, and wither away by a word, as Christ had done to this, which, comparatively speaking, was but a lesser sort of miracle; <p>but also, if ye shall say to this mountain; the Mount of Olives, where Christ and his disciples now were, and were passing over, or, at least, were very near it; or any other mountain wherever they might be, to which they should, upon any occasion, think fit to say, <p>be thou removed, and cast into the sea; which was many miles off from Mount Olivet, and must he a very surprising performance for a mountain to be rooted up, so large as that was, and be carried several miles from its former situation, and be thrown into the sea; and yet, as difficult and amazing as this may seem, <p>it shall be done: that is, provided the person doubts not; or, as it is said in Mark, "shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things, which he saith, shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith": for this must not be confined to the particular instances of drying up a fig tree, or removing a mountain, but the doing of any sort of miracle, how great soever. Nor is it our Lord's meaning that they should do these particular things; nor is it certain that they ever did: but his sense is, that, had they faith, they should be able not only to do such lesser miracles, as, comparatively speaking, the withering of the fig tree was, but they should be able to perform things much more difficult and surprising, whenever the good of the souls of men, the propagation of the Gospel, and the glory of God required them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> doubt not, ye shall not only do this <i>which is done</i> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span><p>(5) How great the force of faith is.<p>(i) The Greek word signifies a fixing or wavering of mind, so that we cannot tell which way to take.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a> f.

The participation in the life of Christ, implied in the <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, would make them partakers of the divine power of which He was the organ, would be a guarantee that their prayers would always be in harmony with the will of God, and so would prevent the promise from being in any way abused.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The affair of the fig-tree</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸ τῆς συκῆς</span>, comp. <a href="/matthew/8-33.htm" title="And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.">Matthew 8:33</a>) should neither be explained on <span class="ital">natural</span> grounds (Paulus says: Jesus saw that the tree was on the point of dying, and that He intimated this “in the popular phraseology”!

It is true He does not make any express <span class="ital">declaration</span> of this nature, nor had He previously led the disciples to expect such (Sieffert); but this objection is met partly by the fact that the <span class="greekheb">πῶς</span> of the disciples’ question, <a href="/matthew/21-20.htm" title="And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!">Matthew 21:20</a>, did not <span class="ital">require</span> Him to do so, and partly by the whole of the subsequent denunciations, which form an eloquent commentary on the silent withering of the fig-tree.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἰτήσητε ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ</span>] Comp. note on <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a> : <span class="ital">what ye will have desired in your prayer</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πιστεύοντες</span>] Condition of the <span class="greekheb">λήψεσθε</span>.

The question of the disciples did not draw from Jesus explanations as to the motive of the malediction. The cursing of the fig tree has always been regarded as of symbolic import, the tree being in Christ’s mind an emblem of the Jewish people, with a great show of religion and no fruit of real godliness. This hypothesis is very credible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">and doubt not</span>] The Greek verb implies the doubt that follows questioning and discussion.

The context of <a href="/acts/10-20.htm" title="Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.">Acts 10:20</a>, where the same word is used, illustrates this passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">but Jesus answering, said</span>, etc.) Our Lord frequently led the disciples from admiration of miracles to things more profitable for salvation; see <a href="/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span>, <span class="ital">faith</span>) The nature of Faith is declared by its opposite, which is <span class="ital">Doubt</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ</span>, <span class="ital">to this mountain</span>) sc. that mentioned in <a href="/matthew/21-1.htm" title="And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,">Matthew 21:1</a> [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Mount of Olives].

They marvelled at this incident; let them have and exercise faith. and they should do greater things than this. Christ had already made a similar answer after the cure of the demoniac boy (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith, and doubt not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The whole phrase  expresses the perfection of the grace. The latter verb means "to discriminate," to see a difference in things, hence to debate in one's mind. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Si habueritis fidem, et non haesitaveritis</span>. What is here enjoined is that temper of mind which does not stop hesitatingly to consider whether a thing can be done or not, but believes that all is possible - that one can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. So the apostles are assured by Christ that they should not only be able to wither a tree with a word, but should accomplish far more difficult undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">This</span> which is done to <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); as, "what was befallen to them that were possessed with devils (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="/matthew/8-33.htm">Matthew 8:33</a>). The promise may intimate that it was to be through the preaching of the apostles, and the Jews' rejection of the salvation offered by them, that the judgment should fall on the chosen people. Thus they would do what was done to the fig tree. And in the following words we may see a prophecy of the destruction of the mountain of paganism. Or it may mean that theocratic Judaism must be cast into the sea of nations before the Church of Christ should reach its full development (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">This mountain.</span> As he speaks, he points to the Mount of Olivet, on which they were standing, or to Moriah crowned by the glorious temple. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou removed;</span> <span class="accented">be thou taken up</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not the same word as in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Mediterranean (see a similar promise, <a href="/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be done.</span> It was not likely that any such material miracle would literally be needed, and no one would ever pray for such a sign; but the expression is hyperbolically used to denote the performance of things most difficult and apparently impossible (see <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>). </body></html>
