These are the words of the high priests and elders, and not of the evangelist, expressing the reason of their fears from the people, who, in general, were thoroughly persuaded, as Luke expresses it, and firmly believed that John was a prophet, that was raised up, and sent immediately by God; and did not derive his authority and commission to preach and baptize from any man, or set of men, whatever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-26.htm" title="But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.">Matthew 21:26</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Φοβούμεθα τὸν ὄχλον</span>] Those words are preceded by an <span class="ital">aposiopesis</span>, the import of which, however (<a href="/luke/20-6.htm" title="But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.">Luke 20:6</a>), is indicated by the words themselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The language of embarrassment: “<span class="ital">But suppose we should say: From men; we are afraid of the people</span>” etc. Comp. note on <a href="/acts/23-9.htm" title="And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.">Acts 23:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάντες γὰρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] See on <a href="/matthew/14-5.htm" title="And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.">Matthew 14:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτός</span>] <span class="ital">He also</span> on His part; for <span class="ital">as they</span> with their wretched <span class="greekheb">οὐκ οἴδαμεν</span> left the question of Jesus <span class="ital">unanswered</span>, so now <span class="ital">in like manner He</span> with His decided and humbling <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἐγώ</span> (<span class="ital">neither do I</span>) <span class="ital">refuses to answer</span> theirs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-26.htm" title="But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.">Matthew 21:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν δὲ</span>, etc.: the mode of expression here is awkward.
