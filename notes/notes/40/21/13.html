for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>); one from Jeremiah’s condemnation of evils like in nature, if not in form, to those against which our Lord protested (<a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm" title="Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 7:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A den of thieves.</span>—The pictorial vividness of the words must not be passed over. Palestine was then swarming with bands of outlaw brigands, who, as David of old in Adullam (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1Samuel 22:1</a>), haunted the lime-stone caverns of Judæa. The wranglings of such a company over the booty they had carried off were reproduced in the Temple, and mingled with the Hallelujahs of the Levites and the Hosannas of the crowds. We ask, as we read the narrative, how it was that the work of expulsion was done so effectively, and with so little resistance. The answer is found (1) in the personal greatness and intensity of will that showed itself in our Lord’s look and word and tone; (2) in the presence of the crowd that had followed Him from the Mount of Olives, and had probably filled the courts of the Temple; and (3) in the secret consciousness of the offenders that they were desecrating the Temple, and that the Prophet of Nazareth, in His zeal for His Father’s house, was the witness of a divine truth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-17 Christ found some of the courts of the temple turned into a market for cattle and things used in the sacrifices, and partly occupied by the money-changers. Our Lord drove them from the place, as he had done at his entering upon his ministry, Joh 2:13-17. His works testified of him more than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling the promise, that the glory of the latter house should be greater than the glory of the former. If Christ came now into many parts of his visible church, how many secret evils he would discover and cleanse! And how many things daily practised under the cloak of religion, would he show to be more suitable to a den of thieves than to a house of prayer!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said It is written ... - This is written in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>. The first part of this verse only is quoted from Isaiah. The rest - "but ye have made it a den of thieves" - was added by Jesus, denoting their abuse of the temple. Thieves and robbers live in dens and caves. Judea was then much infested with them. In their dens thieves devise and practice iniquity. These buyers and sellers imitated them. They made the temple a place of gain; they cheated and defrauded; they took advantage of the poor, and, by their being under a necessity of purchasing these articles for sacrifice, they "robbed" them by selling what they had at an enormous price.<p>The following reasons may be given why this company of buyers and sellers obeyed Christ:<p>1. They were overawed by his authority, and struck with the consciousness that he had a right to command,<p>2. Their own consciences reproved them; they knew they were guilty, and they dared make no resistance.<p>3. The people generally were then on the side of Jesus, believing him to be the Messiah.<p>4. It had always been the belief of the Jews that a "prophet" had a right to change, regulate, and order the various affairs relating to external worship. They supposed Jesus to be such, and they did not dare to resist him.<p>Mark and Luke add, that in consequence of this, the scribes and chief priests attempted to put him to death, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/11-18.htm">Mark 11:18-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47-48</a>. This they did from "envy," <a href="/matthew/27-18.htm">Matthew 27:18</a>. He drew off the people from them, and they envied and hated him. They were "restrained," then, for the fear of the people; and this was the reason why they plotted "secretly" to put him to death, and why they afterward so gladly heard the proposals of the traitor, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-15</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 21:10-22.

In <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>. <p>My house shall be called the house of prayer. These are the, words of God, calling the temple his house, which was built according to the plan he gave; and was the place of his worship, and where he dwelt, and vouchsafed his presence to his people; and signifying, that in time to come, it should be an house of prayer; not for the Jews only, but for the Gentiles also: "for all people", as it is expressed by the prophet, and cited by Mark; and particularly this part of it, in which were the money changers and sellers of doves; for that was the court of the Gentiles, where they were admitted to pray, and perform other parts of worship. These words are rightly applied by Christ to the temple; nor can the Jews themselves deny it; for their own Targum paraphrases it thus, , "the house of my sanctuary shall be called an house of prayer"; or shall be one; for the meaning is not that it should go by such a name, but should be for such use, and not for buying and selling, and merchandise, to which use the Jews now put it: hence it follows, <p>but ye have made it a den of thieves. These are the words of Christ, affirming what is complained of in <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a> and applying it to the present case, on account of the wicked merchandise, unlawful gain, avarice and extortion, of the priests and other officers of the temple, who had a considerable share in these things; and to whom the temple was, and by them used, as a den is to and by thieves and robbers, where they shelter themselves; for these persons robbed both God and man, and the temple was a sanctuary to them: here they screened themselves, and, under the appearance of religion and devotion, devoured widows' houses, plundered persons of their substance, and were full of extortion and excess. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>.

But even on the <span class="ital">first</span> occasion, John 2, their acquiescence is sufficiently explicable from the sudden and decided nature of the proceeding, taken in connection with the spiritually-imposing character of the Lord’s person and bearing (“divinitatis majestas lucebat in facie,” Jerome), so that it is quite needless to resort to the hypothesis of a miracle (Origen, Jerome).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">γέγραπται</span>, it stands written, in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>; from the Sept[115] but with omission of <span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν</span>, retained in Mk., and a peculiarly appropriate expression in the circumstances, the abuse condemned having for its scene the court of the Gentiles.—<span class="greekheb">σπήλαιον λῃστῶν</span>, a den of robbers, a strong expression borrowed from another prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm" title="Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?

This act of Jesus has been justified by the supposed right of the zealot (<a href="/numbers/25-6.htm" title="And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 25:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a>), which is an imaginary right: “ein unfindbar Artikel” (Holtz., H. C.), or by the reforming energy befitting the Messiah (Meyer). It needed no other justification than the indignation of a noble soul at sight of shameless deeds.

These base traffickers had turned the hallowed courts into a cavern where robbers stored their ill-gotten plunder.

And Christ here vindicated the sanctity of the house of God: the Lord, according to the prophecy of Malachi (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>), had suddenly come to his temple to refine and purify, to show that none can profane what is dedicated to the service of God without most certain loss and punishment. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Thieves (&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., correctly, robbers.
