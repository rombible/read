Now circumstances were even more against them. The Prophet was surrounded by His own disciples, and by an admiring crowd.

As men treat God's people, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, if faithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wicked world, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us ask ourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages, render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separate persons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of the vineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy the wicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and they would not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as a despised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced by the Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. But God has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ become more and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation and Cornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, though despised and hated for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At last, they perceived that he spoke of them, and would have gratified their malice at once but they feared the people.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a><p>1. Jesus is omniscient, and sees and knows all things, <a href="/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>.<p>2. It is our duty to obey the Lord Jesus, and to do it at once, <a href="/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>. When He commands there should be no delay. What he orders is right, and we should not hesitate or deliberate about it.<p>3. Especially is this the case where He is to be honored, as he was on this occasion, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>. If it was for "our" interest or honor only that we obeyed him, it would be of less consequence; but our obedience will honor Him, and we should seek that honor by any sacrifice or self-denial.<p>4. We should be willing to give up our property to honor the Lord Jesus, <a href="/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>. He has a right to it. If given to spread the gospel, it goes, as this did, to increase "the triumphs of our King." We should be willing to give our wealth that he might "gird on his sword," and "ride prosperously among the heathen." Everyone who is saved among the pagan by sending the gospel to them will be for the honor of Jesus. They will go to swell his train when he shall enter triumphantly into his kingdom at the day of judgment.<p>5.

Not that they attempted by any outward action to apprehend him, and carry him off, or by any immediate act of violence to take away his life; but they secretly wished, and earnestly desired to do it: they were so irritated and provoked, that they could scarcely keep their hands off of him, and could have been glad of an opportunity of satiating their revenge upon him: and whereby they would but have fulfilled what he in this parable had prophetically said of them: and yet so hardened were they, though they understood his meaning, they were not deterred thereby, but on another account: <p>they feared the multitude; which were now about Christ, lest there should be a tumult, and they should take the part of Christ against them, to which they seemed inclined; when their lives, had they attempted anything of this nature, would have been in a great deal of danger: <p>because they took him for a prophet; by the doctrines which he taught, by the boldness and freedom of speech he used, and by the miracles he wrought: wherefore, though they might not all of them believe that he was the Messiah, or that prophet Moses spoke of; yet, since it was exceeding manifest, that he was a teacher sent of God, and endowed with very wonderful gifts; and from whom many of them had received singular benefits, if not for their souls, yet for their bodies; being healed by him of their lameness, or blindness, or other diseases; therefore would not suffer him to be abused, and ill treated by them: so that, as Mark says, "they left him, and went their way"; to consult together what was proper to be done, and wait for a better opportunity to seize him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span><p>(9) The wicked can do nothing but what God wills.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">46</span>. <span class="ital">when they sought to lay hands on him</span>] The Sanhedrin aimed at two things: (1) to seize Jesus quickly, for the Passover (during which no hostile measures could be taken) was close at hand; and because Jesus might be expected to quit Jerusalem after the feast. (2) To seize Him apart from the people; for the GalilÃ¦ans would suffer no one to lay hands on their King and Prophet.
