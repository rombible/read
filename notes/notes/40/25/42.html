It is as an explanation of the former parables. There is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery. Christ shall come, not only in the glory of his Father, but in his own glory, as Mediator. The wicked and godly here dwell together, in the same cities, churches, families, and are not always to be known the one from the other; such are the weaknesses of saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners; and death takes both: but in that day they will be parted for ever. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he will shortly distinguish between those that are his, and those that are not. All other distinctions will be done away; but the great one between saints and sinners, holy and unholy, will remain for ever. The happiness the saints shall possess is very great. It is a kingdom; the most valuable possession on earth; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the blessed state of the saints in heaven. It is a kingdom prepared. The Father provided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power; the Son purchased it for them; and the blessed Spirit, in preparing them for the kingdom, is preparing it for them. It is prepared for them: it is in all points adapted to the new nature of a sanctified soul. It is prepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was for the saints, and they for it, from all eternity. They shall come and inherit it. What we inherit is not got by ourselves. It is God that makes heirs of heaven. We are not to suppose that acts of bounty will entitle to eternal happiness. Good works done for God's sake, through Jesus Christ, are here noticed as marking the character of believers made holy by the Spirit of Christ, and as the effects of grace bestowed on those who do them. The wicked in this world were often called to come to Christ for life and rest, but they turned from his calls; and justly are those bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him. Condemned sinners will in vain offer excuses. The punishment of the wicked will be an everlasting punishment; their state cannot be altered. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and the curse, are set before us, that we may choose our way, and as our way so shall our end be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the left hand - The wicked.<p>Ye cursed - That is, you who are devoted to destruction, whose characters deserve everlasting punishment, and who are about to enter into it. "To curse" is the opposite of "to bless." It implies a negation of all the blessings of heaven, and a positive infliction of eternal sufferings.<p>Everlasting fire - "Fire," here, is used to denote punishment. The image is employed to express extreme suffering, as a death by burning is one of the most horrible that can be conceived. The image was taken, probably, from the fires burning in the Valley of Hinnom. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>. It has been asked whether the wicked will be burned in literal fire, and the common impression has been that they will be. Respecting that, however, it is to be observed:<p>1. that the main truth intended to be taught refers not to the manner of suffering, but to the certainty and intensity of it.<p>2. that the design, therefore, was to present an image of terrific and appalling suffering - an image well represented by fire<p>3. that this image was well known to the Jews <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>, and therefore expressed the idea in a very strong manner.<p>4. that all the truth that Christ intended to convey appears to be expressed in the certainty, intensity, and eternity of future torment.<p>5. that there is no distinct affirmation respecting the mode of that punishment, where the mode was the subject of discourse.<p>6. that to us it is a subject of comparatively little consequence what will be the mode of punishment.<p>The fact that the wicked will be eternally punished, cursed of God, should awe every spirit, and lead every man to strive most earnestly to secure his salvation. As, however, the "body" will be raised, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a mode of punishment will be adopted suited to the body - perhaps bearing some analogy to suffering here, in its various forms of flames, and racks, and cold, and heat, and disease, and ungratified desire, and remorse - perhaps the concentration of all earthly woes, all that makes man miserable here, poured upon the naked body and spirit of the wicked in hell forever and ever.<p>Prepared for the devil - The devil is the prince of evil spirits. This place of punishment was suited for him when he rebelled against God, Jde 1:6; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-8.htm">Revelation 12:8-9</a>.<p>His angels - His messengers, his servants, or those angels that he drew off from heaven by his rebellion, and whom he has employed as his "messengers" to do evil. The word may extend also to all his followers - fallen angels or people. There is a remarkable difference between the manner in which the righteous will be addressed, and the wicked. Christ will say to the one that the kingdom was prepared for them; to the other, that the fire was not prepared for "them," but for another race of beings. they will inherit it because they have the same character "as the devil," and are therefore suited to the same place - not because it was originally "prepared for them." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, &c.&#8212;As for you on the left hand, ye did nothing for Me.

Hence it appears, that these were such as dwelt among Christians, and professed the Christian name, and yet disregarded the poor members of Christ in distress, when it was in the power of their hands to help them; but when they were hungry and ready to starve for want of food, did not communicate to them for Christ's sake; which showed I that they had no true faith in him, and love to him, and therefore are justly condemned by him; whereas such who never knew Christ, nor any of his people, or any obligation they were under to regard any for Christ's sake, these will never be condemned for the non-performance of these things: <p>I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; as not the least morsel of bread to eat, so not so much as a cup of cold water to drink; which with what follows, are manifest tokens and evidences, that they did not belong to Christ, were not true believers in him, nor had they any real love to him: the grace of God was not in them, and therefore had neither right unto, nor meetness for, the kingdom of heaven; but were righteously banished from the presence of the Lord, and sent to dwell among everlasting burnings; for righteous it was, that such as they who would not show any love to him here, should not dwell with him for ever hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/25.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/25-42.htm" title="For I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:...">Matthew 25:42-43</a>, imply negative all the statements contained in <a href="/context/matthew/25-35.htm" title="For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:...">Matthew 25:35-36</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/25.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/25-42.htm" title="For I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:">Matthew 25:42</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">not</span>, etc.) Sins of omission.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42, 43.</span> - The Lord gives the ground of the sentence, which proceeds on the same terms as the former one. The crimes for which these souls are punished are those of omission and negligence; they failed to per form the most elementary duties of charity and brotherly love which conscience and natural religion enjoin; they had lived utterly selfish and unprofitable lives. If sins of omission are thus punished, we may infer that positive transgressions shall meet with still heavier retribution. </body></html>
