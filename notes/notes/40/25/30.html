Observe this well, reader; slothful servants, who do nothing with respect to the purpose of their being sent into the world, nothing to answer the end of their birth and baptism, who are no way serviceable to the glory of God, or the good of others, will be reckoned with as unprofitable servants. A slothful servant is a withered member in the body, a barren tree in the vineyard, an idle drone in the hive, that is good for nothing. In one sense, indeed, we are all unprofitable servants, <a href="/luke/17-10.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.">Luke 17:10</a>.

Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The day of account comes at last. We must all be reckoned with as to what good we have got to our own souls, and have done to others, by the advantages we have enjoyed. It is not meant that the improving of natural powers can entitle a man to Divine grace. It is the real Christian's liberty and privilege to be employed as his Redeemer's servant, in promoting his glory, and the good of his people: the love of Christ constrains him to live no longer to himself, but to Him that died for him, and rose again. Those who think it impossible to please God, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to purpose in religion. They complain that He requires of them more than they are capable of, and punishes them for what they cannot help. Whatever they may pretend, the fact is, they dislike the character and work of the Lord. The slothful servant is sentenced to be deprived of his talent. This may be applied to the blessings of this life; but rather to the means of grace. Those who know not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. His doom is, to be cast into outer darkness. It is a usual way of expressing the miseries of the damned in hell. Here, as in what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviour goes out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and this serves as a key to the whole. Let us not envy sinners, or covet any of their perishing possessions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And cast ... - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>. The spiritual meaning of the parable may be thus summed up:<p>1. The servants of God are not all endowed with equal gifts and talents.<p>2. All, whatever may be their ability, are bound to employ their talents in promoting his honor, and in a proper improvement of them.<p>3. By employing their talents in a proper manner, they improve and strengthen them.<p>4. They will be judged according to the improvements which they have made.<p>5. All sinners look on God as a hard master, and as unreasonable and tyrannical.<p>6. People will be judged not merely for "doing wrong, but for neglecting to do right."<p>7. If the servant who kept the talent entire without injuring it, and who returned it to his master as he received it, was nevertheless judged, condemned, and cast away, what must they expect who abuse their talents, destroy by drunkenness and lust the noble faculties conferred on them, and squander the property that might be employed in advancing the interests of morals and religion! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. And cast ye&#8212;cast ye out.<p>the unprofitable servant&#8212;the useless servant, that does his Master no service.<p>into outer darkness&#8212;the darkness which is outside. On this expression see on [1359]Mt 22:13.<p>there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth&#8212;See on [1360]Mt 13:42.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 28-30. God often in this life deprives men and women of those gifts which he hath given them, and they do not make use of for the glory of his name, and the good of their and others’ souls, the great ends for which he hath entrusted them with them. But this seems not to be here intended, this text referring to the day of judgment: all therefore that we are to understand by this is; That no man’s gifts, whether of nature or providence, of what advantage soever they have been to him in this life, will be of any profit to him in the day of judgment, unless he hath in this life used them to the ends for which God gave them. In that day he will lose all; and the glory of heaven shall not be the portion of them that have had great talents of learning, wit, riches, honours, spiritual gifts, or any thing of that nature, but of those only who have used these things to the honour and glory of God, and to the advantage of their own and others’ souls. For all those that have been unprofitable, hell will be their portion at last, where their misery will be, as of those that live in extreme darkness, continual weeping and gnashing of teeth. The substance of what is in <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/25-29.htm" title="For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.">Matthew 25:29</a></span> we met with <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To him that hath shall be given, </span>& c.; but I think the proverbial speech here is applied differently from the application of it there. There, <span class="ital">him that hath</span> seemeth to signify, him that hath an actual possession; for it is said before, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</span> So that I take that text to contain a promise of the increase of grace to those that have the seed of God; whereas the appearances of it in others shall not last, but vanish away. Here, plainly, <span class="ital">him that hath</span> signifieth, him that maketh a good and true use of what he hath; and thus the parable expounds it. So as the sense is, He that hath any talents from God, and maketh use of them, and improves them for the honour and glory of God, shall be rewarded with further gifts of grace or glory. But if a man <span class="ital">hath not, </span> that is, hath, but is as if he had not, making no use of what he hath for the glory of God, those gifts and talents which he hath shall be of no profit and advantage, but miserable disadvantage to him at last. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And cast ye the unprofitable servant,.... All the servants of Christ are unprofitable with respect to God; for no man can be profitable to him, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself, or others; or in a way of merit, since when they have done the most and best, they have done but their duty: but this man was unprofitable with respect to himself, having not improved the gift and talent bestowed on him; and with respect to men, being of no use for the conversion of sinners, or the comfort of saints, or the edifying of the body of Christ; and brought no honour to his master, and was of no service for the spreading of his Gospel, and the enlargement of his kingdom and interest; and therefore, as one good for nothing, the ministering angels are bid to take him, and cast him <p>into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth: he shall be turned out of doors into outer darkness, to be a companion of other unhappy creatures; who are also without, bewailing their miserable condition, and reflecting on their past conduct; whilst faithful, diligent, and laborious servants will be within, partaking of a rich entertainment, prepared by their Lord, accompanied with joy unspeakable, and full of glory: <p>See Gill on <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/25.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/25-30.htm" title="And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 25:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀχρεῖον</span>, useless.

The Day of Judgment<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">all nations</span>] Either (1) all the nations of the world, including the Jews; or (2) all the Gentiles. The almost invariable use of <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span> to signify the Gentiles; the unconsciousness of service to Christ shewn by just and unjust alike; the simplicity of the standard proposed by the Judge, favour the second interpretation. On the other hand the special warning to the Apostles, and to the Jewish race, in the previous parts of the discourse render it probable that Jews and Christians are not excluded from this picture of the judgment. The unconsciousness of the judged may be referred not to ignorance of Christ, but to unconsciousness that in relieving the distressed they were actually relieving Christ. The simplicity of the standard may be intended to include what is called “natural” religion, as well as revealed religion. The nations are judged by a standard of justice which <span class="ital">all</span> recognise.

The parable merges into the real. The 'matter represented bursts through the veil under which it was delivered, and stands forth plainly and awfully. The command is issued to the ministers of the Lord's vengeance, whether earthly or angelic. The slave was truly unprofitable, as he advanced neither his master's interests nor his own, which were bound up with the other. While the faithful servants enter into the joy of the Lord, he is rejected from his presence, expelled from the kingdom of heaven, banished we know not whither. And why? Not for great ill doing, sacrilege, crime, offence against the common laws of God and man; but for neglect, idleness, omission of duty. This is a very fearful thought. Men endeavour to screen themselves from blame by minimizing their talents, ability, opportunities; this parable unveils the flimsiness of this pretence, shows that all have responsibilities, and are answerable for the use they make of the graces and faculties, be they never so small, which they possess. Spiritual indolence is as serious a sin as active wickedness, and meets with similar punishment, Our Lord's account of the last judgment terribly confirms this truth (vers. 42-45). <span class="cmt_word">There shall</span>  <span class="cmt_word">be</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>weeping and</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>gnashing of teeth</span> (<a href="/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>). "There," viz. in the outer darkness. The remembrance of lost opportunities, wasted graces, bartered privileges, will fill the mind of the banished with terrible remorse, and make existence a very hell; and what more shall be added? Some of the Fathers have recorded a gnomic saying derived from this parable, if not an utterance of our Lord himself, "Be ye approved bankers." </body></html>
