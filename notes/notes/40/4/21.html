He went not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests and the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. The same power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annas and Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ chooses the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in an honest calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holy life. Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children careful of their parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing. Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to ask ourselves; and, next to that, Am I in my calling? They had followed Christ before, as common disciples, Joh 1:37; now they must leave their calling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his command, leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with them. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to depend upon his grace.

When he had gone but a little way further, <a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19</a> he spied two other persons he was looking for, and had designed to call to the office of apostleship; and these are also described as "brethren", and by name, <p>James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. The Jews make mention in their writings (h), of one   , "R. James, the son of Zebedee": which Capellus (i) conjectures is the very same person here mentioned: but the James they speak of as a disciple of Jesus, they call , "James the heretic" (k); who, they say, was of the village of Secaniah, and sometimes of the village of Sama. His brother's name was John, who was the Evangelist, as well as Apostle: these were <p>in a ship with Zebedee their father. Men of this name, and sons of men of this name, were very common among the Jewish Rabbins; but neither this man, nor his sons, were masters or doctors in Israel; for such Christ chose not for his apostles. It seems to be the same name with Zebadiah, <a href="/1_chronicles/27-7.htm">1 Chronicles 27:7</a> these, with him, were "mending their nets", which were broken, and needed repairing; and perhaps being poor, could not afford to buy new ones: this shows their industry and diligence, and may be a pattern and example to persons, closely to attend the business of their calling, whilst the providence of God continues them in it. <p>And he called them: from their employment, to follow him, and become his disciples; and no doubt gave them the same promise and encouragement he had given the two former. <p>(h) T.

Probably Zebedee and his wife Salome became, unlike Peter's parents, well-known believers. It may be that Peter was the eldest of the Twelve, and that his father was already dead or, though perhaps believing on Jesus, was too old to take any special part in the work. Luke (<a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>) adds, "Who were partners with Simon" - an item of information perhaps obtained from the same source as his first and second chapters.

Other words translated "boat" in the New Testament are <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "little boat" (Mark once, John four times), and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, "small ship's boat" (<a href="/acts/27-16.htm">Acts 27:16, 30, 32</a>). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:21.8) that when he gathered all the boats on the lake to attack Tiberius, there were "not more than four sailors in each;" by which he probably means, not the number of men wherewith he was able to equip them, but the number he found already managing them. <span class="cmt_word">With Zebedee their father</span>.
