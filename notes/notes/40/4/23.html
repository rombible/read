It tells of a vast amount of unrecorded teaching, varying in form, yet essentially the same—a call to repentance—the good news of a kingdom of heaven not far off—the witness, by act for the most part rather than words, that He was Himself the Head of that kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Healing all manner of sickness.</span>—In the Greek, as in the English, sickness implies a less serious form of suffering than “disease,” as the “torments” of the next verse imply, in their turn, something more acute. St. Matthew’s first mention of our Lord’s miracles cannot be read without interest. It will be seen that they are referred to, not directly as evidence of a supernatural mission, but almost, so to speak, as the natural accompaniments of His work; signs, not of power only or chiefly, but of the love, tenderness, pity, which were the true marks or “notes” of the kingdom of heaven. Restoration to outward health was at once the pledge that the Son of Man had not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them, and often, we cannot doubt, served to strengthen that faith in the love of the Father, some degree of which was all but invariably required as an antecedent condition of the miracle (<a href="/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Jesus went about all Galilee </span>— Accompanied, it seems, by the four disciples above named; <span class="ital">teaching in their synagogues </span>— The word, <span class="greekheb">συναγωγη</span>, rendered, <span class="ital">synagogue, </span>may either signify the congregation, or the place in which they assembled. But it seems here, and generally, to mean the latter. Synagogues were in every city, from the time of the Babylonish captivity, and perhaps before that time. For, it is certain, the Jews neither did nor could assemble in the temple at Jerusalem for public worship every sabbath day, and therefore it is probable they had other places throughout the country to assemble in. This seems, indeed, to have been absolutely necessary, not only that the people might join in prayer together, but to bring them, in some degree, acquainted with the law of God. For, as copies of it were very scarce, the body of the people must, of necessity, have remained ignorant of it, unless it were read to them in public, and that in other places besides the temple, which the women in general could not visit at all, and the men but very seldom. Accordingly, in the 74th Psalm, which, by whomsoever it was composed, plainly speaks of the destruction of the temple, of Jerusalem, and of the Jews, by the Chaldeans, we read of all the synagogues of the land being burned up, which certainly implies that there were synagogues in the land before they were thus destroyed; and therefore before the captivity of Babylon. After the restoration from Babylon, they became very frequent. Even in Jerusalem itself, where one would have imagined they were less necessary, on account of the temple being there, the Hebrew doctors and other ancient and learned writers inform us, that there were above four hundred. It was usual to have service in them thrice a day, on three days of the week, when public prayer was put up, and the Scriptures were read and expounded. And though it belonged chiefly to the priests, Levites, and scribes to teach, yet it was the custom for any one of ability to do it. <span class="ital">Preaching the gospel of the kingdom </span>— Namely, that doctrine whereby the kingdom of heaven, that is, of grace here and glory hereafter, is revealed and offered to men, and, by obedience to which, they come to partake of it. <span class="ital">Healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease among the people </span>— Intending by these beneficent actions to confirm his doctrine, at the same time that he relieved the temporal distresses of mankind.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:23-25 Wherever Christ went, he confirmed his Divine mission by miracles, which were emblems of the healing power of his doctrine, and the influences of the Spirit which accompanied it. We do not now find the Saviour's miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are cured by medicine, the praise is equally his. Three general words are here used. He healed every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none too hard, for Christ to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; the palsy, which is the greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is the greatest malady of the mind; and possession of the devil, which is the greatest misery and calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and by thus curing bodily diseases, showed that his great errand into the world was to cure spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, and torment of the soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Galilee - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/2-22.htm">Matthew 2:22</a>.<p>Synagogues - Places of worship, or places where the people assembled together to worship God. The origin of synagogues is involved in much obscurity. The sacrifices of the Jews were appointed to be held in one place, at Jerusalem. But there was nothing to forbid the other services of religion to be performed at any other place. Accordingly, the praises of God were sung in the schools of the prophets; and those who chose were assembled by the prophets and seers on the Sabbath, and the new moons, for religious worship, <a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-11</a>. The people would soon see the necessity of providing convenient places for their services, to shelter them from storms and from the heat, and this was probably the origin of synagogues. At what time they were commenced is unknown. They are mentioned by Josephus a considerable time before the coming of Christ; and in his time they were multiplied, not only in Judea, but wherever there were Jews. There were no less than 480 in Jerusalem alone before it was taken by the Romans.<p>Synagogues were built in any place where ten men were found who were willing to associate for the purpose, and were the regular customary places of worship. In them the law, i. e. the Old Testament, divided into suitable portions, was read, prayers were offered, and the Scriptures were expounded. The law was so divided that the five books of Moses, and portions of the prophets, could be read through each year. The Scriptures. after being read, were expounded. This was done, either by the officers of the synagogue, or by any person who might be invited by the officiating minister. Our Saviour and the apostles were in the habit of attending at those places continually, and of speaking to the people, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14-15</a>.<p>The synagogues were built in imitation of the temple, with a center building, supported by pillars, and a court surrounding it. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. In the center building, or chapel, was a place prepared for the reading of the law. The law was kept in a chest, or ark, near to the pulpit. The uppermost seats <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a> were those nearest to the pulpit. The people sat around, facing the pulpit. When the law was read, the officiating person rose; when it was expounded, he was seated. Our Saviour imitated their example, and was commonly seated in addressing the people, <a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-1.htm">Matthew 13:1</a>.<p>Teaching - Instructing the people, or explaining the gospel.<p>The gospel of the kingdom - The good news respecting the kingdom he was about to set up; or the good news respecting the coming of the Messiah and the nature of his kingdom.<p>Preaching - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>.<p>All manner of sickness - All kinds of sickness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues&#8212;These were houses of local worship. It cannot be proved that they existed before the Babylonish captivity; but as they began to be erected soon after it, probably the idea was suggested by the religious inconveniences to which the captives had been subjected. In our Lord's time, the rule was to have one wherever ten learned men or professed students of the law resided; and they extended to Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and most places of the dispersion. The larger towns had several, and in Jerusalem the number approached five hundred. In point of officers and mode of worship, the Christian congregations are modelled after the synagogue.<p>and preaching the gospel of the kingdom&#8212;proclaiming the glad tidings of the kingdom,<p>and healing all manner of sickness&#8212;every disease.<p>and all manner of disease among the people&#8212;every complaint.

He went about "all" this country, both upper and nether Galilee, which was very populous: Josephus says (l), there were two hundred and four cities and towns in it; he means, which were places of note, besides villages. He went about, not like Satan, seeking the destruction of men; but as one that went along with him says, "doing good", <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>, both to the bodies and souls of men; for he was <p>teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom. The places where he taught were "their synagogues": he did not creep into private houses, as the Pharisees then, and false apostles afterwards did; but he appeared openly, and declared his doctrine in places of public worship; where the Jews met together for divine service, to pray, read the Scriptures, and give a word of exhortation to the people; for though they had but one temple, which was at Jerusalem, they had many synagogues, or meeting places, all over the land: here Christ not only prayed and read, but "preached"; and the subject matter of his ministry was, "the Gospel of the kingdom": that is, the good news of the kingdom of the Messiah being come, and which now took place; wherefore he exhorted them to repent of, and relinquish their former principles; to receive the doctrines, and submit to the ordinances of the Gospel dispensation: he also preached to them the things concerning the kingdom of heaven; as that except a man be born again, he cannot see it; and unless he has a better righteousness than his own, he cannot enter into it: he was also <p>healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease among the people.

A colourless general statement serving as a mere prelude to chapters 5–9. It points to a ministry in Galilee, varied, extensive, and far-famed, conceived by the evangelist as antecedent to the Sermon on the Mount; not necessarily covering a long period of time, though if the expression “teaching in their synagogues” be pressed it must imply a good many weeks (<span class="ital">vide</span> on Mk.).

Jesus was an evangelist, a master, and a healer of disease. Matt. puts the teaching function first in accordance with the character of his gospel. The first gospel is weak in the evangelistic element compared with the third: <span class="greekheb">διδαχή</span> is more prominent than <span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα</span>. The healing function is represented as exercised on a large scale: <span class="greekheb">πᾶσαν νόσον καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν</span>, every form of disease and ailment. Euthy.

(<span class="greekheb">βάσανος</span>, first a touch-stone, <span class="ital">lapis Lydius</span>, as in Pindar, Pythia, x. 105: <span class="greekheb">Πειρῶντι δὲ καὶ χρυσὸς ἐν βασάνῳ πρέπει καὶ νόος ὀρθός</span>; then an instrument of torture to extract truth; then, as here, tormenting forms of disease.) The fame, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀκοὴ</span>, of such a marvellous ministry naturally spread widely, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὅλην τὴν Συρίαν</span>, throughout the whole province to which Palestine belonged, among Gentiles as well as Jews. Crowds gathered around the wonderful Man from all quarters: west, east, north, south; Galilee, Decapolis on the eastern side of the lake, Jerusalem and Judaea, Peraea. With every allowance for the exaggeration of a popular account, this speaks to an extraordinary impression.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">their synagogues</span>] The synagogue, built on a hill or on the highest place in the city, distinguished sometimes by a tall pole corresponding to a modern steeple, was as familiar and conspicuous in a Jewish town as the Church is in an English village. Sometimes, however, the synagogue was placed on the bank of a river. Sometimes it was constructed without a roof and open to the sky.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Divine service was held in the synagogue on the Sabbath and also on the second and fifth day of each week.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The service consisted in reading the Law and the Prophets by those who were called upon by the “Angel of the Church,” and in prayers offered up by the minister for the people; the people responding “Amen” as with us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. But the Synagogues were not churches alone. Like Turkish mosques they were also Courts of Law in which the sentence was not only pronounced but executed, “they shall scourge you in their synagogues.” Further, the Synagogues were Public Schools, “the boys that were scholars were wont to be instructed before their masters in the synagogue” (Talmud). Lastly, the Synagogues were the Divinity Schools or Theological Colleges among the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. The affairs of the Synagogue were administered by ten men, of whom three, called “Rulers of the Synagogue,” acted as judges, admitted proselytes and performed other important functions. A fourth was termed the “Angel of the Church” or bishop of the congregation; three others were deacons or almoners. An eighth acted as “interpreter,” rendering the Hebrew into the Vernacular; the ninth was the master of the Divinity School, the tenth his interpreter; see ch. <a href="/matthew/10-27.htm" title="What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.">Matthew 10:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is interesting to trace in the arrangements of the Synagogue part of the organization of the Christian Church.

"The synagogues were places of assembly for public worship, where on sabbaths and feast-days (at a later period, also on the second and fifth days of the week) the people met together for prayer, and to listen to the reading of portions of the Old Testament, which were translated and explained in the vernacular dialect.

This expression (with ver. 17, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand") is the earliest form of the message. The good news centred in the kingdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the realization of the position accepted by the nation at Sinai, with all that that involved, (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 23.).

In <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>, the Rev. rightly transposes sickness and disease; for &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (A. V., sickness) carries the notion of something severe, dangerous, and even violent (compare the Latin noceo, to hurt, to which the root is akin). Homer always represents &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; as the visitation of an angry deity. Hence used of the plague which Apollo sent upon the Greeks ("Iliad," 1:10). So Sophocles ("Antigone," 421) calls a whirlwind &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (a divine visitation). Disease is, therefore, the more correct rendering as expressing something stronger than sickness or debility. Sickness, however, suits the other word, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The kindred adjective, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, means soft, as a couch or newly-ploughed furrow, and thus easily runs into our invidious moral sense of softness, namely, effeminacy or cowardice, and into the physical sense of weakness, sickness. Hence the word emphasizes the idea of debility rather than of violent suffering or danger.<p>In <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a> we have, first, a general expression for ailments of all kinds: all that were sick (lit., all who had themselves in evil case; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;). Then the idea of suffering is emphasized in the word taken (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), which means literally held-together or compressed; and so the Rev. holden is an improvement on taken, in which the A. V. has followed Wyc. and Tynd. The word is used of the multitude thronging Christ (<a href="/luke/8-45.htm">Luke 8:45</a>). Compare, also, "how am I straitened (<a href="/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>); and I am in a strait (<a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1-3</a>). Then follow the specific forms of suffering, the list headed again by the inclusive word &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, diseases, and the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; following having the force of and particularly. Note the word torments (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;). &#x392;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; originally meant the "Lydian stone," or touchstone, on which pure gold, when rubbed, leaves a peculiar mark. Hence, naturally, a test; then a test or trial by torture. "Most words," says Professor Campbell ("On the Language of Sophocles") have been originally metaphors, and metaphors are continually falling into the rank of words," used by the writer as mere vehicles of expression without any sense of the picturesque or metaphorical element at their core. Thus the idea of a test gradually passes entirely out of &#x392;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; leaving merely the idea of suffering or torture. This is peculiarly noticeable in the use of this word and its derivatives throughout the New Testament; for although suffering as a test is a familiar New Testament truth, these words invariably express simply torment or pain. Wycliffe renders, "They offered to him all men having evil, taken with divers sorrows and torments;" and Tyndale, "All sick people that were taken with divers diseases and gripings." Lunatic, or moon-struck, (&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), is rendered by Rev. epileptic, with reference to the real or supposed influence of the changes of the moon upon the victims of epilepsy. </body></html>
