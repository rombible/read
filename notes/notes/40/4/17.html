It is important to remember that it had been preceded by a ministry of some months in Judæa; that that ministry had been outwardly like that of the Baptist (<a href="/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>); and that He had withdrawn from it upon John’s imprisonment because He knew that His own growing fame had attracted the notice of the Pharisees.

And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,">Luke 4:17-21</a> gives us a representative example. To read the prophetic lesson for the day, to make that His text, to proclaim the necessity of repentance and the good news of forgiveness following on repentance, to bear His witness that “the kingdom of heaven” was not in the far-off future, but nigh at hand, in the midst of them—this we must believe was, <span class= "ital">at</span> this time, as ever, the substance of His teaching and preaching.

In the former sense, it is opposed to repentance, by which it is preceded; in the latter, to the Mosaic dispensation. Our Lord now properly and fully entered upon his prophetic office; which consisted of three things: preaching, or making known the will of God; gathering disciples; and working miracles. The first of these he does here, and more largely chap. 5., 6., 7., and in his many parables and other discourses. The second, <a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers....">Matthew 4:18-22</a>.

Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Jesus in the presence of the people does not yet designate Himself as the Messiah, but announces in quite a general way the nearness of the Messianic kingdom, the divinely-ordained bearer of which He knew <span class="ital">Himself</span> to be; this is quite in keeping with the humility and wisdom of His first appearance, when He resumed the preaching of John. The view, that at the beginning He did not regard Himself as the Messiah, but only as a forerunner like John, and only at a later time appropriated to Himself the Messianic idea (Strauss, Schenkel), is in contradiction to all the four Gospels. But in His <span class="ital">self-attestation</span> as the Messiah He proceeded to work, according to the Synoptics, in a more <span class="ital">gradual</span> manner than He did according to John.

After settling in Capernaum Jesus began to preach. The phrase <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τότε</span> offends in two ways, first as redundant, being implied in <span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο</span> (De Wette); next as not classic, being one of the degeneracies of the <span class="greekheb">κοινή</span>. Phrynichus forbids <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τότε</span>, and instructs to say rather <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἐκείνου</span> (Lobeck’s ed., p. 45).—<span class="greekheb">κηρύσσειν</span>, the same word as in describing the ministry of the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>).

It may seem as if the evangelist meant to represent Jesus as simply taking up and continuing the arrested ministry of the Baptist. So He was in form and to outward appearance, but not in spirit. From the very first, as has been seen even in connection with the baptism, there was a deep-seated difference between the two preachers. Even Euthy. Zig. understood this, monk though he was. Repent, he says, with John meant “in so far as ye have erred” = amendment; with Jesus, “from the old to the new” (<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς παλαιᾶς ἐπὶ τὴν καινήν</span>) =a change from within. For the evangelist this was the absolute beginning of Christ’s ministry.

He no doubt uses the phrase, <span class="ital">the Kingdom of God</span>, in accordance with the custom of the rest of the Evangelists, but only in the conference with Nicodemus; indicating that same truth by implication, when Jesus is described as the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God</span>. as <span class="ital">the Life</span>, as <span class="ital">the Light</span>, as <span class="ital">the Bridegroom</span>, as He <span class="ital">into whose hands</span> the Father hath given <span class="ital">all things</span>, to whom He hath committed <span class="ital">power over all flesh</span>, as also <span class="ital">all judgment</span>; who, in fine, is <span class="ital">to draw all men to Himself</span>, and such like declarations.
