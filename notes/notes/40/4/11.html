Here also we are in the region of the spiritual life, and must be content to leave the nature of the ministration undefined, instead of sensualising it as poets and artists have done. What is instructive is, that the help of their service, the contrast between the calm and beauty of their presence and that of the wild beasts and of the Tempter, comes as the reward of the abnegation which refused to make their ministry the subject of an experimental test. In this case, also, we find strange coincidences. The fact recorded by St. Matthew explains the words recorded by St. John (<a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>) as uttered but a few days later, and which speak of “the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” The words with which St. Luke ends his record of the Temptation may well be noticed here: “And having finished every temptation, the devil departed from him for a season” (literally, <span class= "ital">till a season</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The conflict was not yet ended, and was from time to time renewed—now in the passionate prayer of the disciple (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>), now in the open enmity of the prince of this world (<a href="/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then the devil </span>— Being so baffled and confounded as not to be able to present any other temptation which seemed more likely to prevail, <span class="ital">leaveth him </span>— Namely, for a season, as Luke observes meditating no doubt some future assault, and especially designing, by and by, to use all stratagems to take away his life. <span class="ital">And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him </span>— Not only furnishing him with proper supplies for his hunger, but also congratulating him on so illustrious a victory over the prince of darkness; and doing him honour by the appearance of a number of them, (for one of them would nave sufficed to bring him food,) after this horrible combat with Satan, to which, for wise and gracious reasons, he was pleased to condescend. And it may encourage us in all our temptations to remember, that if our conflict be thus maintained, the struggle will, ere long, be over; and angels, who are now spectators of the combat, will at length congratulate our victory. God teaches us, by all this, that our lives are to have their vicissitudes of temptation and consolation, and that our temptation shall have a happy issue, and that when ordinary means fail we may expect extraordinary helps.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-11 Concerning Christ's temptation, observe, that directly after he was declared to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, he was tempted; great privileges, and special tokens of Divine favour, will not secure any from being tempted. But if the Holy Spirit witness to our being adopted as children of God, that will answer all the suggestions of the evil spirit. Christ was directed to the combat. If we presume upon our own strength, and tempt the devil to tempt us, we provoke God to leave us to ourselves. Others are tempted, when drawn aside of their own lust, and enticed, Jas 1:14; but our Lord Jesus had no corrupt nature, therefore he was tempted only by the devil. In the temptation of Christ it appears that our enemy is subtle, spiteful, and very daring; but he can be resisted. It is a comfort to us that Christ suffered, being tempted; for thus it appears that our temptations, if not yielded to, are not sins, they are afflictions only. Satan aimed in all his temptations, to bring Christ to sin against God. 1. He tempted him to despair of his Father's goodness, and to distrust his Father's care concerning him. It is one of the wiles of Satan to take advantage of our outward condition; and those who are brought into straits have need to double their guard. Christ answered all the temptations of Satan with It is written; to set us an example, he appealed to what was written in the Scriptures. This method we must take, when at any time we are tempted to sin. Let us learn not to take any wrong courses for our supply, when our wants are ever so pressing: in some way or other the Lord will provide. 2. Satan tempted Christ to presume upon his Father's power and protection, in a point of safety. Nor are any extremes more dangerous than despair and presumption, especially in the affairs of our souls. Satan has no objection to holy places as the scene of his assaults. Let us not, in any place, be off our watch. The holy city is the place, where he does, with the greatest advantage, tempt men to pride and presumption. All high places are slippery places; advancements in the world makes a man a mark for Satan to shoot his fiery darts at. Is Satan so well versed in Scripture as to be able to quote it readily? He is so. It is possible for a man to have his head full of Scripture notions, and his mouth full of Scripture expressions, while his heart is full of bitter enmity to God and to all goodness. Satan misquoted the words. If we go out of our way, out of the way of our duty, we forfeit the promise, and put ourselves out of God's protection. This passage, De 8:3, made against the tempter, therefore he left out part. This promise is firm and stands good. But shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? No. 3. Satan tempted Christ to idolatry with the offer of the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. The glory of the world is the most charming temptation to the unthinking and unwary; by that men are most easily imposed upon. Christ was tempted to worship Satan. He rejected the proposal with abhorrence. Get thee hence, Satan! Some temptations are openly wicked; and they are not merely to be opposed, but rejected at once. It is good to be quick and firm in resisting temptation. If we resist the devil he will flee from us. But the soul that deliberates is almost overcome. We find but few who can decidedly reject such baits as Satan offers; yet what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Christ was succoured after the temptation, for his encouragement to go on in his undertaking, and for our encouragement to trust in him; for as he knew, by experience, what it was to suffer, being tempted, so he knew what it was to be succoured, being tempted; therefore we may expect, not only that he will feel for his tempted people, but that he will come to them with seasonable relief.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the devil leaveth him - He left him for a time, <a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>. He intended to return again to the temptation, and, if possible, to seduce him yet from God. Compare <a href="/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>; <a href="/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>.

They came and supplied his wants and comforted him. From this narrative we may learn:<p>(a) That no one is so holy as to be free from temptation, for even the Son of God was sorely tempted.<p>(b) That when God permits a temptation or trial to come upon us, he will, if we look to him, give us grace to resist and overcome it, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>.<p>(c) We see the art of the tempter. His temptations are adapted to times and circumstances. They are plausible. What could have been mere plausible than his suggestions to Christ? They were applicable to his circumstances. They had the appearance of much piety. They were backed by passages of Scripture misapplied, but still most artfully presented. Satan never comes boldly and tempts people to sin, telling them that they are committing sin. Such a mode would defeat his design. It would put people on their guard. He commences, therefore, artfully and plausibly, and the real purpose does not appear until he has prepared the mind for it. This is the way with all temptation. No wicked person would at once tempt another to be profane, to be drunk, to be an infidel, or to commit adultery. The principles are first corrupted. The confidence is secured. The affections are won. And then the allurement is little by little presented, until the victim falls. How everyone should be on his guard at the very first appearance of evil, at the first suggestion that may possibly lead to sin!<p>(d) One of the best ways of meeting temptation is by applying Scripture. So our Saviour did, and they will always best succeed who best wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Then the devil leaveth him&#8212;Luke says, "And when the devil had exhausted"&#8212;or "quite ended," as in Lu 4:2&#8212;"every (mode of) temptation, he departed from him till a season." The definite "season" here indicated is expressly referred to by our Lord in Joh 14:30 and Lu 22:52, 53.<p>and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him&#8212;or supplied Him with food, as the same expression means in Mr 1:31 and Lu 8:3. Thus did angels to Elijah (1Ki 19:5-8). Excellent critics think that they ministered, not food only, but supernatural support and cheer also. But this would be the natural effect rather than the direct object of the visit, which was plainly what we have expressed. And after having refused to claim the illegitimate ministration of angels in His behalf, oh, with what deep joy would He accept their services when sent, unasked, at the close of all this temptation, direct from Him whom He had so gloriously honored! What "angels' food" would this repast be to Him! and as He partook of it, might not a Voice from heaven be heard again, by any who could read the Father's mind, "Said I not well, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased?"<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Resist the devil, </span> saith James, <span class="bld"><a href="/james/4-7.htm" title="Submit yourselves therefore to God.

God by this teacheth us, that our lives are to have their vicissitudes of temptations and consolations, and that our temptations shall have a happy issue, and that when ordinary means fail we may expect extraordinary influences and assistances. Luke saith, <span class="ital">he departed from him for a season, </span> to let us know, that though there was an end of his more eminent temptations, yet he was not afterward without Satan’s assaults. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the devil leaveth him,.... In <a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a> it says, <p>when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season, or until a season. That is, having tempted him with all sorts of temptations, and tried him every way to no purpose; having gone through, and finished the whole scheme and course of temptations he had devised, without success; and having orders from Christ to depart, which he was obliged to obey, leaves him for a while, till another opportunity of tempting him in some other way should offer; or till the time came, when he should be so far able to get the advantage of him, as to bruise his heel, or bring him to the dust of death; see <a href="/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a> and when he was gone, better company came in his room; <p>behold, angels came and ministered to him. They came to him in a visible, human form, as they were used to do under the Old Testament dispensation, and that after the temptation was over; after Satan was foiled, and was gone; that it might appear that Christ alone had got the victory over him, without any help or assistance from them. When they were come, they "ministered to him"; that is, they brought him food of their own preparing and dressing, as they formerly did to Elijah, <a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5</a> to satisfy his hunger, and refresh his animal spirits; which had underwent a very great fatigue during this length of time, in which he fasted, and was tempted by Satan. Thus, as the angels are ministring spirits to the heirs of salvation, both in a temporal and in a spiritual sense, <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a> so they were to Christ. Nothing is more frequent with the Jews than to call the angels  "ministring angels": it would be needless and endless to refer to particular places. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄγγελοι</span>] <span class="ital">Angels</span>, without the article.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διηκόνουν</span>] <span class="ital">ministered</span> to Him.

But considering the appropriateness of the above definite explanation, it is not right to be satisfied with one that is indefinite and wavering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to the representation of the evangelists, the temptation of Jesus by the devil appears in the connection of the history <span class="ital">as a real external marvellous occurrence</span>. See Ch. F. Fritzsche in Fritzschior. <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. p. 122 ff. To abide by this view (Michaelis, Storr, Ebrard, P. Ewald, Graul, Könemann, Arnoldi, Schegg, Delitzsch, Nebe, Engelhardt, Hofmann, Riggenbach, Baumgarten) is a necessary consequence of the denial of any legendary elements in the canonical Gospels, and is equally justifiable with this denial in general. The evangelists were aware that they were relating a real external history in time and space (in answer to Kuhn, Lichtenstein), and the choice only remains between adopting either this view or assuming that of an ideal history in the garb of legend, gradually brought into shape by the power of the idea. All attempts at explaining away the devil and his external appearance are arbitrary contradictions or critical carpings, opposed to the design and representations of the evangelists, more or less of a rationalistic character. This holds good, not merely of the absurd, and, in relation to the third act, even monstrous view of those who, instead of the devil, introduce one or even various <span class="ital">individuals</span>, perhaps a member of the Sanhedrim or high priest, who wished to examine Jesus and to win Him over, or destroy Him (Herm. v. d. Hardt, <span class="ital">Exegesis he. difficilior. quat. ev</span>. p. 470 ff.; Basedow, Venturini, Möller, <span class="ital">neue Ansichten</span>, p. 20 ff.; Rosenmüller, Kuinoel, Feilmoser in the <span class="ital">Tüb. Quartalschr</span>. 1828, 1, 2), but also of the view which regards the event as a <span class="ital">vision</span>, whether this was brought about by the <span class="ital">devil</span> (Origen? Pseudo-Cyprian, Theodore of Mopsuestia), or by <span class="ital">God</span> (Farmer, <span class="ital">Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ’s Temptation</span>, London, 1761; comp. also Calvin on <a href="/matthew/4-5.htm" title="Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,">Matthew 4:5</a>), or by <span class="ital">natural means</span> (Balth. Becker, Scultetus, Clericus, Wetstein, Bolten, Bertholdt, Jahn, Gabler, Paulus, Gratz, Pfieiderer), or of those who view it as a significant morning dream (Meyer in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Kritik</span>. 1831, p. 319 ff.),—which interpretations, moreover, are in contradiction with the clear repose and moral definiteness of the divine-human consciousness of Jesus, in virtue of which there never occurs in His life any condition of ecstasy, or a trace of any special manifestations in dreams. Akin to this, but equally offensive to the gospel history, and besides by no means leaving unaffected the moral character of the development of Jesus Himself, if we look to <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>, is the view which transforms the occurrence into an <span class="ital">internal</span> history, which took place in the thoughts and fancy of Jesus (Döderlein, Eichhorn, <span class="ital">allg. Bibl</span>. III. p. 283 ff.; Thaddaeus <span class="ital">d. i.</span> Dereser, <span class="ital">d. Versuch. Christi</span>, Bonn 1794; Hezel, Augusti, Bretschneider, Weisse, <span class="ital">Kritik d. ev. Gesch</span>. II. p. 12; Hocheisen in the <span class="ital">Tüb. Zeitschr</span>. 1833, 2; Kohlschütter, Pfeiffer, Rink, Ammon, Laufs, Schenkel, Held). On this view the devil has again been recently brought forward, on grounds exegetically justifiable, as the operating principle (Krabbe, Hoffmann, Schmid, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> I. p. 65; and very indirectly also by Ullmann); while, in a more arbitrary manner, it has been attributed to the disciples that they apprehended in an objective form the inner fact related to them by Jesus, that He had rejected the false idea of the Messiah; whilst Neander, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 120 ff., substantially giving up the <span class="ital">reality</span> of the history of the temptation (“a fragmentary symbolical setting forth of the facts of His inner life,” where the manner of the devil’s co-operation is left undetermined), holds hesitatingly by its truth; and Kuhn, moreover, is divided between the historical and unhistorical view of the manner of its occurrence. To those who transfer the history into the inner life of Jesus’ spirit, belong also Hase and Olshausen, the <span class="ital">former</span> of whom recognises in it the whole history of His mental growth, probably externalized by Himself, with reference to Exodus 16, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm" title="And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm" title="For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.">Psalm 91:11</a> f, into an individual fact, but in the tradition assumed to be actual history, and who volatilizes the devil into the spirit of the world; while Olshausen, notwithstanding the <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος</span> in <a href="/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>, finds the reality of the. occurrence in this, that the soul of Jesus was exposed to the full operations of the kingdom of darkness; while Lange regards the internal temptation of Jesus as caused by the devil, but brought about by human means—that is, as an assault of the sympathetic in working of the national and world spirit upon His soul, and as the tentative representatives of this spirit, drags in, by an invention that is his own, the deputation of the Sanhedrim, which had been despatched to John (<a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>), as they were on their way back to Jerusalem. With more caution and with profounder historical insight, Keim (comp. Weizsäcker, p. 239 ff.) regards the history of the temptation in the light of the victorious beginning of the struggle with Satan, <a href="/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:">Matthew 12:25</a> ff., where the historical kernel is the heavy weight of questions and doubts which were imposed on the soul of Jesus whilst He was calmly meditating upon the <span class="ital">obligation</span> and the <span class="ital">manner</span> of His vocation to the Messiahship, and on His decision to enter upon it, which had so powerfully taken hold of Him on the banks of the Jordan; on this initial victory Jesus could not have left His disciples without some information. But however we may apprehend the narrative as an historical occurrence in the mind of Jesus, the monstrous nature of the external formation of the history remains the more inexplicable the more directly its origin is brought into connection with Jesus Himself and His circle of disciples, especially as the threefold details of the temptation were still unknown to Mark. To view the event as a <span class="ital">parable</span>, is in contradiction to the narrative, arbitrary in itself, and alien to the style of parabolic address employed by Jesus elsewhere. So, after older writers, who, however, endanger the sinless character of Jesus, it has been viewed as a symbolical address of Jesus or of one of His disciples directed against false Messianic hopes. See Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">Schr. d. Lukas</span>, 54f., and <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 157 ff.; B. Crusius, <span class="ital">bibl.

Handb</span>. I. p. 376), whose assaults as proceeding from the <span class="ital">devil</span> against the Son of man would be planned with as much clumsiness as pointlessness,—there thus remains nothing else than to explain the narrative which in Mark still exhibits its first undeveloped beginnings, the first crystallisations of its ideal contents, the subject of which the narrators deemed to be true history, and repeated as such, as a legend, the contents of which, regarded as <span class="ital">thought</span>, possessed historical truth, and which arose among Jewish Christians,[391] being derived from the idea of the Messiah as opposed to the devil, and the necessity and complete realization of which was exhibited in the whole life and work of Christ, placed, like a compendious programme, an “<span class="ital">epitome omnium tentationum</span>” (Bengel), at the beginning of the Messianic career, which commenced at the baptism. Not as if there had not been on the part of Jesus after His baptism, and before His entrance on His work, the most serious preparation and most intense concentration of thought in still retirement, in which the whole opposition of the devil, as well as the manner of His own struggles and conquests which had been peculiarly determined by God, must have presented themselves vividly before His eyes; although this alone could not have given rise to the history of the temptation. For that purpose it was necessary that His holy life, that actual victory over Satan, should first be completed. That narrative might now first have arisen in the living history-moulding power of the ideas which prevails generally throughout the preliminary history, first of all in the form in which it appears in Mark, but soon after gradually expanded into detail, yet again silently excluded by John, considering the impossibility of assigning a place to it in connection with his history. Its expanded form, however, as it lies before us in Matthew and Luke, corresponds with the highest internal truth to the main relations of the opposition directed by the power of the devil against the second Adam and His kingdom,—an opposition which is decidedly to be recognised from the very beginning onwards to the end, and victory over which was the condition of His whole work. In this way the contents of the narrative, the psychological factors of which are quite as much the temptability as the sinlessness of the Lord, certainly belong to the history, but not as a concrete occurrence with its three individual acts, but as a summary reflection of the work of Jesus in His vocation in relation to the demoniacal kingdom, without, however, our being obliged to assume as an historical foundation any internal temptation taking place in thought, and any originally symbolic representation of the same, which was transformed into actual history in the course of tradition (de Wette). This foundation is rather the complete victory of our Lord over the craft and power of the devil, as the whole course of His Messianic life is a series of temptations by the devil, with the result of the latter being conquered both in detail and in the main (<a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>); comp. <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>. With profound meaning and truth (for <span class="ital">from the very beginning</span> must Jesus make experience of the enemy of His kingdom, begin the struggle with him, and become certain of the right victory) has the synoptic tradition unanimously assigned to the narrative the early place which it occupies; and the attempt cannot be successful to maintain a later special situation as the historical seat of its origin, as Pfleiderer does, who transposes the vision which he assumes into the time of ch. 15 16, making use, moreover, of <a href="/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26</a> for the first act of the temptation. That the history of the temptation in Matthew is even a later insertion derived from oral tradition (Köstlin), is a very arbitrary inference, from the circumstance that <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a> does not make any reference to the history of the temptations; Matthew follows Mark, and quotes his short notice from a special source.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The existence of Satan, as well as his <span class="ital">personality</span>, is attested throughout the whole of the New Testament, and is altogether independent of the view which may be taken of this individual narrative; see in answer to Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span>, Philippi, <span class="ital">Dogm</span>.

I. 1, p. 379 ff.; Ewald.—The <span class="ital">locality</span> of the temptation, the <span class="ital">wilderness</span>, was at once suggested as the idea gradually assumed bodily form from the sojourn of Jesus with the Baptist, and from the popular belief that demons had their dwellings in the wilderness; the <span class="ital">forty days</span>, however, found their venerable point of connection in the types of Moses and Elias (hardly of the <span class="ital">forty years</span>’ duration of the <span class="ital">wanderings of the people</span> in the wilderness, which Delitzsch, Baumgarten, and others drag in here as a type).
