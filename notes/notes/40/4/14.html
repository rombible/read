Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That it might be fulfilled ... - This place is recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>.

Upper Galilee was called Galilee of the Gentiles, because it was occupied chiefly by Gentiles.

The ancient Jews expected the Messiah to make his first appearance in Galilee; which expectation must be grounded on this prophecy; for so they say (y) expressly, <p>"the king Messiah shall be revealed , "in the land of Galilee."'' <p>And in another place (z) explaining <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a> they paraphrase it thus, <p>""for fear of the Lord"; this is the indignation of the whole world: and for the "glory of his majesty"; this is the Messiah; when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth, when he shall arise and be revealed , "in the land of Galilee": because that this is the first place to be destroyed in the holy land; therefore he shall be revealed there the first of all places.'' <p>Here Jesus, the true Messiah, made his first appearance publicly; here he called his disciples, and began his ministry. <p>(x) See my treatise upon the "Prophecies of the Messiah", &amp;c. p. 147, &amp;c.
