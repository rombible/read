The death was plain and terrible to him, for he failed to grasp the idea of the resurrection. The remonstrance would perhaps have been natural at any time, but the contrast between this prediction and the tone of confidence and triumph in the previous promise doubtless intensified its vehemence. Personal love for his Lord, his own desire to share in the glory which that promise had implied, were united in his refusal to accept this as the issue towards which they were tending.<p><span class= "bld">Be it far from thee, Lord.</span>—The words are a paraphrase rather than a translation of the original. Literally, the words are an abbreviated prayer, “(<span class= "ital">God be</span>) merciful to Thee,” the name of God, as in our colloquial “Mercy on us!” being omitted. The phrase is of frequent occurrence in the Greek version of the Old Testament, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm" title="Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.">Numbers 14:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-8.htm" title="Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to your people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.">Deuteronomy 21:8</a>. It is almost idle to attempt to trace a distinctly formulated thought in the sudden utterance of sorrow and alarm, but so far as the words go they seem of the nature of a protest against what seemed to the disciple a causeless despondency, a dark view of the future, at variance alike with his own expectations and what seemed to him the meaning of his Master’s previous words. The words that followed were, however, more than a prayer, “This shall not be unto Thee,” as though his power to bind and to loose extended even to the region of his Master’s work and the means by which it was to be accomplished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Peter took him — </span><span class="greekheb">Προσλαβομενος αυτον</span>. What the evangelist meant precisely by this expression, commentators are not agreed. Dr. Doddridge renders it, <span class="ital">taking him by the hand; </span>Mr. Wesley, <span class="ital">taking hold of him: </span>others again render it, <span class="ital">embracing him; </span>and others, <span class="ital">interrupting him. </span>Dr. Campbell renders it, <span class="ital">taking him aside, </span>a translation which, he observes, evidently suits the meaning of the verb in other places, and is necessary in <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>, which cannot be interpreted otherwise. <span class="ital">And began to rebuke </span>[or reprove] <span class="ital">him </span>— So the expression, <span class="greekheb">ηρξατο επιτιμαν αυτω</span>, properly signifies. “Some interpreters, indeed, to put the best face on Peter’s conduct on this occasion, render the words thus, <span class="ital">Began to expostulate with him. </span>But when the verb, <span class="greekheb">επιτιμαν</span>, relates to any thing past, it always implies a declaration of censure or blame; and if it be thought that this would infer great presumption in Peter, it may be asked, Does not the rebuke which he drew on himself, <a href="/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23</a>, from so mild a Master, evidently infer as much? When we consider the prejudices of the disciples in regard to the nature of the Messiah’s kingdom, we cannot be much surprised that a declaration, such as that in <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>, totally subversive of all their hopes, should produce, in a warm temper, a great impropriety of behaviour, such as (admitting the ordinary interpretation of the word) Peter was then chargeable with.” <span class="ital">Be it far from thee, Lord — </span>Or, <span class="greekheb">ιλεως σοι </span>seems to be more accurately rendered in the margin, <span class="ital">Pity thyself </span>or <span class="ital">be merciful to, </span>or <span class="ital">favour, thyself </span>— “The advice of the world, the flesh, and the devil,” says Mr. Wesley, “to every one of our Lord’s followers.” The common use of this phrase, however, in the LXX., would lead one to understand it as signifying, <span class="ital">absit, God forbid. </span>In this sense, also, it is used in the Apocrypha, thus, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-21.htm" title="God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.">1Ma 2:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">ιλεως ημιν καταλιπειν νομον</span>, <span class="ital">God forbid that we should forsake the law. </span>Peter, to whom the power of the keys, or place of high-steward, in the kingdom, as he would understand it, was promised, could not help being very much displeased to hear his Master talk of dying at Jerusalem, immediately after he had been saluted Messiah, and had accepted the title. Therefore he rebuked, or reproved him, as has been just observed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:21-23 Christ reveals his mind to his people gradually. From that time, when the apostles had made the full confession of Christ, that he was the Son of God, he began to show them of his sufferings. He spake this to set right the mistakes of his disciples about the outward pomp and power of his kingdom. Those that follow Christ, must not expect great or high things in this world. Peter would have Christ to dread suffering as much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ's love and patience by our own. We do not read of any thing said or done by any of his disciples, at any time, that Christ resented so much as this. Whoever takes us from that which is good, and would make us fear to do too much for God, speaks Satan's language. Whatever appears to be a temptation to sin, must be resisted with abhorrence, and not be parleyed with. Those that decline suffering for Christ, savour more of the things of man than of the things of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Peter took him - This may mean either that he interrupted him, or that he took him aside, or that he took him by the hand as a friend.<p>This latter is probably the true meaning. Peter was strongly attached to him. He could not bear to think of Jesus' death. He expected, moreover, that he would be the triumphant Messiah. In his ardor, and confidence, and strong attachment, he seized him by the hand as a friend, and said, "Be it far from thee." This phrase might have been translated, "God be merciful to thee; this shall not be unto thee." It expressed Peter's strong desire that it might not be. The word "rebuke" here means to admonish or earnestly to entreat, as in <a href="/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>. It does not mean that Peter assumed authority over Christ, but that he earnestly expressed his wish that it might not be so. Even this was improper. He should have been submissive, and not have interfered.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Then Peter took him&#8212;aside, apart from the rest; presuming on the distinction just conferred on him; showing how unexpected and distasteful to them all was the announcement.<p>and began to rebuke him&#8212;affectionately, yet with a certain generous indignation, to chide Him.<p>saying, Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee&#8212;that is, "If I can help it": the same spirit that prompted him in the garden to draw the sword in His behalf (Joh 18:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Peter took our Lord aside, as we do our friend to whom we would speak something which we would not have all to hear, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and began to rebuke him; </span> epitiman, to reprove him, as men often do their familiar friends, when they judge they have spoken something beneath them, or that might turn to their prejudice; saying, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</span> The words in the Greek want the verb, so leave us in doubt whether we should translate them, Be merciful to thyself, spare thyself, or, Let God, or God shall, be merciful unto thee. The last words expound them; <span class="ital">this shall not be unto thee.</span> God shall be merciful unto thee, and help thee, this shall not betide thee. These words were undoubtedly spoken by Peter out of a good intention, and with a singular affection to his Master; but, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. They spake him as yet ignorant of the redemption of mankind by the death of Christ, of the doctrine of the cross, and of the will of the Father concerning Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They spake great weakness in him, to contradict him whom he had but now acknowledged to be the Christ, the Son of God. Good intentions, and good affections, will not justify evil actions.

The Arabic version reads it, "called to him": the Ethiopic, "answered him"; and the Syriac, "led him"; he took him aside, by himself; and as the Persic version, "privately said to him", or he took him by the hand in a familiar way, to expostulate with him, and dissuade him from thinking and talking of any such things; <p>and began to rebuke him: reprove and chide him, forgetting himself and his distance; though he did it not out of passion and ill will, but out of tenderness and respect; looking upon what Christ had said, unworthy of him, and as what was scarce probable or possible should ever befall him, who was the Son of the living God, and overlooking his resurrection from the dead, and being ignorant at present of the end of Christ's coming into the world, and redemption and salvation by his sufferings and death: <p>saying, far be it from thee, Lord, or "Lord, be propitious to thyself", or "spare thyself": the phrase answers to , often used by the Targumists (u) and stands in the Syriac version here. The Septuagint use it in a like sense, in <a href="/genesis/43-23.htm">Genesis 43:23</a>. Some think the word "God" is to be understood, and the words to be considered, either as a wish, "God be propitious to thee": or "spare thee", that no such thing may ever befall thee; or as an affirmation, "God is propitious to thee", he is not angry and displeased with thee, as ever to suffer any such thing to be done to thee: but it may very well be rendered, by "God forbid"; or as we do, "far be it from thee", as a note of aversion, and abhorrence of the thing spoken of: <p>this shall not be done unto thee: expressing his full assurance of it, and his resolution to do all that in him lay to hinder it: he could not see how such an innocent person could be so used by the chief men of the nation; and that the Messiah, from whom so much happiness was expected, could be treated in such a manner, and especially that the Son of the living God should be killed. <p>(u) Targum Hieros. in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.22. &amp; Targum Onkelos in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20.htm">1 Samuel 20</a>.9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Peter <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</span><p>(q) Took him by the hand and led him aside, as they used to do, which meant to talk familiarly with one.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προσλαβόμ</span>.] <span class="ital">after he had taken Him to himself</span>, comp. <a href="/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> had taken Him aside to speak to Him privately.

Either taking him aside, or taking him by the hand or dress - a reverent familiarity permitted by the Lord to his loving apostle.

That the same person should be so humiliated and yet so glorious, was beyond his conception. He was as much in  the dark as his fellow apostles; of that which was not specially revealed to him he knew nothing. It was the carnal mind that here influenced him, not the spiritually enlightened soul. By writing "began," the historian intimates that he had not time to say much before the Lord mercifully interposed and cut him short. <span class="cmt_word">Be it far from thee;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">absit a te.</span> The Greek phrase is elliptical, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> being understood; "God be merciful to thee," equivalent to "God forbid."

It is used in deprecation of a disastrous event. <span class="cmt_word">This shall not be unto thee;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. This is a very strong assertion, not a prayer or wish, as some would make it; the use of language is quite against that, as the phrase is predictive, never prohibitory, in his mistaken zeal and his ignorant affection, Peter would be wiser than his Lord. The cross and Passion shall never be thy lot; Messiah cannot suffer, the Son of God cannot die. Such merely human asseveration, even prompted by undoubted love, had to be checked and rebuked. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Took (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Not, took him by the hand, but took him apart to speak with him privately.
