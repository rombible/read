They had failed to understand the mysterious hints of the future which we find in, “Destroy this temple” (<a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>), in the Son of Man being “lifted up” (<a href="/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>), in the sign of the prophet “Jonas” (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>). Now the veil is uplifted, and the order of events is plainly foretold—the entry into Jerusalem, the rejection, the condemnation, the death, the resurrection. It is obvious that if we accept the record as true the prediction is one which implies a foreknowledge that is at least supernatural, and is so far evidence of a divine mission, if not also of a divine nature in the speaker. And it may well be urged that in this case the incidents which surround the prediction—as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Peter’s protest, and the rebuke addressed to him in such striking contrast with the previous promise—have a character of originality and unexpectedness which negatives the hypothesis of its being a prophecy after the event. On the other hand, the fact that the disciples did not take in the meaning of the prediction as to His rising from the dead may, in its turn, be pleaded in bar of the assumption that the prophecy lingered in men’s minds, and suggested the belief in a mythical, in the absence of a real, fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">From that time forth </span>— When they had made that full confession of Christ that he was the Messiah, the Son of God; <span class="ital">began Jesus to show unto his disciples </span>— Another most important point, namely, that he must suffer and be put to death, as a malefactor. If they had not been well grounded in their belief of Christ’s being the Son of God, it would have been a great shock to their faith to be informed that he must suffer and die. Some hints, indeed, our Lord had already given of his sufferings, as when he said, <span class="ital">Destroy this temple, </span>and spoke of the Son of man being <span class="ital">lifted up, </span>and of <span class="ital">eating his flesh </span>and <span class="ital">drinking his blood; </span>but hitherto he had not spoken plainly and expressly of the subject, because the disciples were weak, and could not have borne the notice of a thing so very strange and so very melancholy. But now, as they were more advanced in knowledge and stronger in faith, he began to reveal this to them: for he declares his mind to his people gradually, and lets in light as they can bear it, and are prepared to receive it. <span class="ital">How that he must go unto Jerusalem </span>— The holy city, the royal city, and suffer there. Though he had lived most of his time in Galilee, he must die at Jerusalem; there all the sacrifices were offered; and there, therefore, He must die who was to be the great sacrifice. Thither he was to go within the short space of a few months, this declaration being made in the last year of his life: and instead of being owned, under the royal character he bore, and submitted to by the princes and people, must <span class="ital">suffer many things </span>from <span class="ital">the elders </span>— The most honourable and experienced men; from the <span class="ital">chief priests </span>— Accounted the most religious, and <span class="ital">the scribes — </span>The most learned body of men in the nation. These made up the great sanhedrim, which sat at Jerusalem, and was had in veneration by the people: and these one would have expected to have been the very first to receive him. But instead of this, they were the most bitter in persecuting him! Strange, indeed, that men of knowledge in the Scriptures, who professed to expect the Messiah’s coming, and sustained a sacred character, should use him with such contumely and cruelty when he came! It was the Roman power, indeed, that condemned and crucified Christ; but the principal share of the guilt of the whole business lies at the door of the chief priests and scribes, who were the first and principal movers in it. From them he suffered many things, things which manifested their insatiable malice, and his invincible patience, and in the issue was <span class="ital">killed: </span>for nothing short of his death would either satisfy the malice of his enemies, or render him a proper sacrifice for the sins of mankind. Our Lord, however, while he brought to his disciples these melancholy tidings, added, for their support and encouragement under this gloomy prospect, that <span class="ital">in the third day he should be raised again. </span>And thus, as all the prophets had done, when he <span class="ital">testified beforehand </span>his sufferings, he bore witness likewise to the glory that should follow, <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>.

From that time, when the apostles had made the full confession of Christ, that he was the Son of God, he began to show them of his sufferings. He spake this to set right the mistakes of his disciples about the outward pomp and power of his kingdom. Those that follow Christ, must not expect great or high things in this world. Peter would have Christ to dread suffering as much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ's love and patience by our own. We do not read of any thing said or done by any of his disciples, at any time, that Christ resented so much as this. Whoever takes us from that which is good, and would make us fear to do too much for God, speaks Satan's language. Whatever appears to be a temptation to sin, must be resisted with abhorrence, and not be parleyed with. Those that decline suffering for Christ, savour more of the things of man than of the things of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31-33</a>; <a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>. "From that time forth." This was the first intimation that he gave that he was to die in this cruel manner. He had taken much pains to convince them that he was the Messiah; he saw by the confession of Peter that they were convinced, and he then began to prepare their minds for the awful event which was before him. Had he declared this when he first called them they would never have followed him. Their minds Were not prepared for it. They expected a temporal, triumphant prince as the Messiah. He first, therefore, convinced them that he was the Christ, and then, with great prudence, began to correct their apprehensions of the proper character of the Messiah.<p>Elders - The men of the great council or Sanhedrin.

From the time that Peter made the confession concerning Jesus, as that he was the Messiah, and Son of God, and which things were clear to all the apostles, he began to teach them more expressly, and to point out to them more clearly, and plainly, his sufferings and death, than he had done before: and this he chose to do now, partly because that their faith in him was well grounded and established, so that they were the better able to bear these things he told them, which before might have been more staggering and discouraging to them; and partly, that being forewarned of them, they would not be so shocking when they came to pass: as also to destroy all their expectations of a temporal kingdom, which they might now be big with, he having so fully and freely owned himself to be the Messiah: and this also furnishes out some reasons why Jesus would not have his disciples, for the present, declare him to be the Messiah, that his death might not, by any means, be prevented, which was so necessary; since, should the princes of the world know him, they would not crucify him: and besides, seeing he was to suffer, and die, and rise again for the salvation of his people, it was proper that all this should be over before he was so publicly declared to be the Messiah, the Saviour, and Redeemer. <p>How that he must go to Jerusalem: the metropolis of the nation, where the great sanhedrim sat, who only could take cognizance of him, under the imputation of a false prophet, and condemn him to death, and which therefore would be in the most public manner; and though it would add to his reproach, would leave no room to be doubted of. The word "must", not only belongs to his going to Jerusalem, but to his sufferings, death, and resurrection; all which must be because of the immutable decree of God, the council, and covenant of grace, and peace, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and the redemption and salvation of God's elect; these required them, and made them absolutely necessary: <p>and suffer many things of the elders, chief priests, and Scribes: who would lie in wait for him, send persons to apprehend him, insult, reproach, and despitefully use him; load him with false charges, accusations, and calumnies, and deliver him to the Gentiles, to be mocked, scourged, and crucified: and this is aggravated as what would be done to him, not by the common people, or the dregs of them, but by the principal men of the city, by the sanhedrim, which consisted of the "elders" of the people, their senators; for this is not a name of age, but of office and dignity; and of the "chief priests", the principal of them, those of the greatest note among them, who were chosen members of the grand council; and of "the Scribes", a set of men in high esteem for their learning and wisdom: <p>and be killed; signifying, that he should not die a natural death, but that his life should be taken from him in a cruel and violent manner, without any regard to law or justice; indeed, that he should be properly murdered; but for the comfort of his disciples, and that they might not be overmuch pressed and cast down, at the hearing of these things, he adds, <p>and be raised again the third day according to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and the type of Jonas. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</span><p>(8) The minds of men are at this time to be prepared and made ready against the stumbling block of persecution.<p>(p) It was a name of dignity and not of age: and it is used for those who were the judges, whom the Hebrews call the Sanhedrin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπὸ τότε ἤρξατο</span>] Comp. <a href="/matthew/4-17.htm" title="From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 4:17</a>; a note of time marking an important epoch. “Antea non ostenderat,” Bengel.

All this is not to be disposed of by simply saying that the disciples had not understood the prediction of Jesus (<a href="/mark/9-22.htm" title="And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.">Mark 9:22</a>); for had it been so plainly and directly uttered, they could not have <span class="ital">failed</span> to understand it, especially as, in the course of His own ministry, cases had occurred of the dead being restored to life, and as the Messianic hopes of the disciples must have disposed them to give a ready reception to tidings of a resurrection. Then, again, the <span class="ital">fulfilment</span> would necessarily have had the effect of awakening both their memory and their understanding, and that all the more that precisely then light was being shed upon the mysterious saying regarding the temple of the body (<a href="/john/2-21.htm" title="But he spoke of the temple of his body.">John 2:21</a> f.). We must therefore suppose that Jesus had made certain dark, indefinite allusions to His resurrection, which as yet had not been apprehended in their true meaning, and that it was only <span class="ital">ex eventu</span> that they assumed, in the course of tradition, the clear and definite form of a prediction such as is now before us.

II. p. 7 ff.), Kuinoel, Ebrard, and others in favour of the perfect authenticity of the definite and literal predictions of the resurrection, are not conclusive, and, to some extent, move in a circle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[460] Whoever supposes that it was only somewhere about this time that the thought of His impending sufferings and death first began to dawn upon Jesus (Hase, Weizsäcker, Keim, Wittichen), can do so only by ignoring previous statements on the part of the Lord, which already point with sufficient clearness to His painful end (see especially <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>, <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a>)—statements the testimony of which is to be set aside only by explaining away and rejecting them by the artifice of mixing up together dates of different times, and the like, and thus depriving them of validity, a course which is decidedly opposed to the Gospel of John (comp. <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>,<a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>, <a href="/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>, <a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a> ff.) so long as its authenticity is recognised!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day....">Matthew 16:21-28</a>. <span class="ital">Announcement of the Passion with relative conversation</span> (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.">Mark 8:31</a> to <a href="/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="/context/luke/9-22.htm" title="Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day....">Luke 9:22-27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">From that time forth</span>] An important note of time.

Not by supposing that obscure hints of the Passion were afterwards put into this explicit form; but rather (1) partly by the blindness of those who will not see; (2) partly by the constant use of metaphor by Jesus. “Might not,” they would argue, “this ‘death and rising again’ be a symbol of a glorious visible kingdom about to issue from our present debasement?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">21–23</span>.

The first proposition is, <span class="ital">Jesus is the Christ</span>; the second, <span class="ital">Christ must suffer, die, and rise again</span> (cf. <a href="/context/john/16-30.htm" title="Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God....">John 16:30-32</a>), or more briefly, <span class="ital">Christ by death will enter into glory</span>. Jesus first convinced His disciples of the first proposition (de subjecto):[756] in consequence of which they were bound to believe Him concerning the second (de prædicato), even before His passion. After His ascension, the people first learnt the second proposition (prædicatum), and thence were convinced of the first (de subjecto); see <a href="/acts/17-3.htm" title="Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.">Acts 17:3</a>. As soon as Jesus had persuaded His disciples of the first proposition (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>), He added the second.[757] Afterwards He led them to the mountain of Transfiguration.[758] The order of the evangelic harmony is of great importance with regard to the observing of these things. Men frequently teach all things at once: Divine wisdom acts far otherwise.—<span class="greekheb">δεικνύειν</span>, <span class="ital">to show), i.e.</span> openly.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι δεῖ Αὐτὸν ἀπελθεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">that He must go</span>) and at the same time relinquish that mode of living to which the disciples had become habituated.—<span class="greekheb">παθεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to suffer</span>) When aught of glory accrued to Jesus, as in this instance by the confession of Peter, then He was especially wont to make mention of His approaching passion. This first announcement mentions His passion and death generally; the second, in ch. <a href="/context/matthew/17-22.htm" title="And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:...">Matthew 17:22-23</a>, adds His being betrayed into the hands of sinners; the third, in ch. <a href="/context/matthew/20-17.htm" title="And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,...">Matthew 20:17-19</a>, at length expresses His stripes, cross, etc. The first was nearer in point of time to the second, than the second to the third.—<span class="greekheb">πρεσβυτέρων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερέων</span>, <span class="greekheb">γραμματέων</span>, <span class="ital">elders—chief priests—scribes</span>) Three classes of those who ought to have led the people to the Messiah; corresponding nearly to the Council of Justice, the Consistory, and the Theological Faculty of modern times.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγερθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">to be raised</span>) He adds nothing yet of His ascension. By degrees, all further and later particulars are disclosed; see <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[755] Except in covert [enigmatical] words.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[756] “De subjecto,” “de prædicato,” lit. “of the subject,” “of the prædicate.” I have ventured to render the passage in language more generally intelligible.—(I.

He had already intimated his future sufferings, though his disciples had been slow to receive these dark hints, so opposed to all their preconceived opinions of Messiah's glory and victorious career. Such sayings as, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up" (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), had fallen unheeded on the disciples' ears, and had not guided them to forecast the future. Even the allusions to their own trials, in the warnings about bearing the cross and following him (<a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>), were not understood. The great point of his real nature had become clear to them; they had now to learn that the way to glory, both for him and them, led through suffering and death. Conscious of Christ's Divinity, they could now more patiently endure the mystery of his cross and Passion. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Jerusalem.</span> The appointed scene of these events (see <a href="/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">go</span> thither to meet and endure these sufferings, because it was so ordained in the counsels of God and announced by the prophets (comp. <a href="/matthew/26-54.htm">Matthew 26:54</a>; <a href="/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26, 46</a>).

The three classes are, in Nosgen's opinion, intentionally named here - the elders, as the most aged and venerated members, or such as were distinguished by rank and character; the chief priests, heads of the twenty-four courses, as office bearers of the theocracy; and scribes, at that time occupying almost the position of the prophets. The whole religious world would thus be combined against Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Be killed.</span> He does not here say "crucified," as he did afterwards (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>), only gradually revealing the whole awful truth. <span class="cmt_word">Be raised again the third day.</span> This announcement was intended to support the disciples in view of Christ's sufferings and death. And "the third day" is mentioned, not only for typical reasons, but to assure them that his death should be speedily followed by his return to life from the grave. It is obvious to us that Jesus prophesied plainly concerning his resurrection; but such an event, so unprecedented, so unexperienced, was not understood; and though the prediction was so far known as to cause his grave to be watched, it was only a vague kind of expectation, without form or definiteness, that was cherished, and the actual fact came as a surprise (see <a href="/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10, 32</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From that time began (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>He had not shown it to them before.<p>Must (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>It was necessary in fulfilment of the divine purpose.
