When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</span> Our Saviour here charges them with three things, ignorance, unbelief, forgetfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Ignorance, in that they did not understand that his usual way was to discourse spiritual things to them under earthly similitudes, and so by leaven he must understand something else than leaven with which men use to leaven their bread. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Unbelief, that they having seen the power and goodness of the Lord and Master, to feed four thousand with seven loaves, and five thousand with five loaves, leaving a great remainder, and that he did this for a mixed multitude, out of a mere compassion to the wants and cravings of human nature, should not judge that he was able to provide for them, although they had brought no bread; or doubt whether he would do it or no for them, who were much dearer to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Forgetfulness, which is often in Scripture made the mother of unbelief and disobedience. <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm" title="Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;">Deu 4:9</a>,23 25:19 <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm" title="And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.">Psalm 78:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is nothing of difficulty in the terms, only from this history we may learn these things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That God expects that we should not only hear and see, but understand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That he looks we should not only hear for the present time, but for the time to come. Christ expected that his disciples should have learned from his doctrine about washing of hands, that he could not mean the leaven of bread, but something else, which might defile them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That he is much displeased with his own people, when he discerns blindness and ignorance in them, after their more than ordinary means of knowledge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That former experiences of God’s power and goodness manifested for us, or to us, ought to strengthen our faith in him when we come under the like circumstances; and a disputing or doubting after such experiences argues but a little and very weak faith, and a hardness of heart, that the mercies of God have not made a just impression on our souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</span> Mark, instead of <span class="ital">and of the Sadducees, </span> hath, <span class="ital">and of the leaven of Herod, </span> which hath made some think that Herod was a Sadducee.

Justification by the works of the law, and those works too according to that imperfect sense of the law they gave. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

They said there was no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit: these were principles excellently suited to men of atheistical hearts and lives, and it is more than probable that Herod and his courtiers, and some of his lords and great captains, had sucked in some of these principles, and these were the Herodians mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a> <a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These doctrines are by our Saviour compared to leaven, not only because of the sour nature of it, but also because heretics’ words (as the apostle saith) eat as doth a canker, and are of a contagious nature; as leaven doth diffuse its quality into the whole mass of meat.

It was very common with the Jews (a) to call the corruption and vitiosity of nature by the name of , "leaven in the lump": hence our Lord calls their doctrine so, because it proceeded from thence, and was agreeable thereunto; and uses the phrase on purpose to expose it, and bring it into neglect and contempt. <p>(z) Misn.

He shows them what leaven did not mean in this passage; it was their part, when they heard what it was not, to gather what it must be. Thus also in ch. <a href="/matthew/17-13.htm" title="Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.">Matthew 17:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τὴς διδακῆς</span>, <span class="ital">from that of the doctrine</span>)[726] sc. from the leaven of the doctrine.[727] The word doctrine, in opposition to bread, is taken in a wide signification, so as to mean even hypocrisy.

In a wider sense it might include practice as well as precept, manner of life as well as teaching. The same spirit permeated all. "See," says St. Chrysostom, "how much good his reproof wrought. For it both led them away from the Jewish observances, and, when they were remiss. made them more heedful, and delivered them from want of faith; so that they were not afraid nor in alarm, if at any time they seemed to have few loaves; nor were they careful about famine, but despised all these things." </body></html>
