The teaching as to the unworldliness of His kingdom which the disciples so much needed was to be generalised in its widest possible extent. Those who were following Him, as many did, in idle wonder, or with the desire of earthly greatness, must do so knowing its conditions.<p><span class= "bld">If any man will come after me.</span>—The “will” is more than a mere auxiliary; “<span class= "ital">willeth,”</span> “desireth” to come after.<p><span class= "bld">Let him deny himself, and take up his cross.</span>—Our common thoughts of “self-denial,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the denial <span class= "ital">to</span> ourselves of some pleasure or profit, fall far short of the meaning of the Greek. The man is to deny his whole self, all his natural motives and impulses, so far as they come into conflict with the claims of Christ. If he does not so deny himself, he is in danger, as Peter was (it is significant that the same word is used in both instances), of denying his Lord. The self-denial here commanded has, accordingly, its highest type and pattern in the act by which the Son of God, in becoming man, “emptied Himself (see Note on <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7</a>) of all that constituted, if we may so speak, the “self” of His divine nature. The words “take up his cross,” which the disciples had heard before (see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>), were now clothed with a new and more distinct meaning, by the words that spoke so clearly of the death of which the cross was to be the instrument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/16-24.htm" title="Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.">Matthew 16:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said Jesus unto his disciples — </span>In Mark we read, <span class="ital">When he had called the people unto him, and his disciples also, he said unto them; </span>and in Luke, <span class="ital">He said to them all, If any man will come after me </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ει τις θελει</span>, <span class="ital">If any man be willing, </span>no one is forced: but if any will be a Christian, it must be on the following terms. <span class="ital">Let him deny himself </span>— A rule that can never be too much observed: let him in all things deny his own will, however pleasing, and do the will of God, however painful. <span class="ital">And take up his cross </span>— Of the origin and meaning of this phrase, see note on <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>. And we may here further learn, that after having undergone many afflictions and trials, the disciples of Christ may still look for more, which, when laid upon them, they must endeavour, by the grace of God, to sustain with equal patience, following their Master in the footsteps of his sufferings. This, indeed, is a very hard and difficult lesson, but at the same time it is absolutely necessary. Because if we grow impatient under sufferings, and endeavour to avoid the crosses which God is pleased to lay upon us, we shall displease God, grieve his Spirit, and bring ourselves under guilt and condemnation. And should we not consider all crosses, all things grievous to flesh and blood, as what they really are, as opportunities of embracing God’s will, at the expense of our own? and consequently as so many steps by which we may advance in holiness? We should make a swift progress in the spiritual life, if we were faithful in this practice. Crosses are so frequent, that whoever makes advantage of them will soon be a great gainer. Great crosses are occasions of great improvement: and the little ones which come daily, and even hourly, make up in number what they want in weight. We may, in these daily and hourly crosses, make effectual oblations of our will to God: which oblations, so frequently repeated, will soon amount to a great sum. Let us remember, then, (what can never be sufficiently inculcated,) that God is the author of all events: that none is so small or inconsiderable as to escape his notice and direction. Every event, therefore, declares to us the will of God, to which, thus declared, we should heartily submit. We should renounce our own to embrace it. We should approve and choose what his choice warrants as best for us. Herein should we exercise ourselves continually; this should be our practice all the day long. We should in humility accept the little crosses that are dispensed to us, as those that best suit our weakness. Let us bear these little things, at least, for God’s sake, and prefer his will to our own in matters of so small importance. And his goodness will accept these mean oblations; for he despiseth not the day of small things.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:24-28 A true disciple of Christ is one that does follow him in duty, and shall follow him to glory. He is one that walks in the same way Christ walked in, is led by his Spirit, and treads in his steps, whithersoever he goes. Let him deny himself. If self-denial be a hard lesson, it is no more than what our Master learned and practised, to redeem us, and to teach us. Let him take up his cross. The cross is here put for every trouble that befalls us. We are apt to think we could bear another's cross better than our own; but that is best which is appointed us, and we ought to make the best of it. We must not by our rashness and folly pull crosses down upon our own heads, but must take them up when they are in our way. If any man will have the name and credit of a disciple, let him follow Christ in the work and duty of a disciple. If all worldly things are worthless when compared with the life of the body, how forcible the same argument with respect to the soul and its state of never-ending happiness or misery! Thousands lose their souls for the most trifling gain, or the most worthless indulgence, nay, often from mere sloth and negligence. Whatever is the object for which men forsake Christ, that is the price at which Satan buys their souls. Yet one soul is worth more than all the world. This is Christ's judgment upon the matter; he knew the price of souls, for he redeemed them; nor would he underrate the world, for he made it. The dying transgressor cannot purchase one hour's respite to seek mercy for his perishing soul. Let us then learn rightly to value our souls, and Christ as the only Saviour of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This discourse is also recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34-38</a>; <a href="/mark/9-1.htm">Mark 9:1</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23-27</a>.<p>Let him, deny himself - That is, let him surrender to God his will, his affections, his body, and his soul.

The first is self-denial. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">him deny himself.</span> There is no better test of reality and earnestness in the religious life than this. (See a sermon of Newman's on this subject, vol. 1. serm. 5.) If a man follows Jesus, it must be by his own free will, and he must voluntarily renounce everything that might hinder his discipleship, denying himself even in things lawful that he may approach the likeness of his Master. <span class="cmt_word">Take up his cross.</span> This is the second point. St. Luke adds, "daily." He must not only be resigned to bear what is brought upon him - suffering, shame, and death, which he cannot escape, but be eager to endure it, meet it with a solemn joy, be glad that he is counted worthy of it. <span class="cmt_word">Follow me.</span> The third point. He must be energetic and active, not passive only and resigned, but with all zeal tracking his Master's footsteps, which lead on the way of sorrows. Here too is comfort; he is not called to a task as yet untried; Christ has gone before, and in his strength he may be strong. </body></html>
