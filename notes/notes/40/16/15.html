This showed that they believed Jesus to be more than man. Our Lord declared Peter to be blessed, as the teaching of God made him differ from his unbelieving countrymen. Christ added that he had named him Peter, in allusion to his stability or firmness in professing the truth. The word translated rock, is not the same word as Peter, but is of a similar meaning. Nothing can be more wrong than to suppose that Christ meant the person of Peter was the rock. Without doubt Christ himself is the Rock, the tried foundation of the church; and woe to him that attempts to lay any other! Peter's confession is this rock as to doctrine. If Jesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church, but deceivers and deceived. Our Lord next declared the authority with which Peter would be invested. He spoke in the name of his brethren, and this related to them as well as to him. They had no certain knowledge of the characters of men, and were liable to mistakes and sins in their own conduct; but they were kept from error in stating the way of acceptance and salvation, the rule of obedience, the believer's character and experience, and the final doom of unbelievers and hypocrites. In such matters their decision was right, and it was confirmed in heaven. But all pretensions of any man, either to absolve or retain men's sins, are blasphemous and absurd. None can forgive sins but God only. And this binding and loosing, in the common language of the Jews, signified to forbid and to allow, or to teach what is lawful or unlawful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they said ... - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>.

He saith unto them, But whom&#8212;rather, "who."<p>say ye that I am?&#8212;He had never put this question before, but the crisis He was reaching made it fitting that He should now have it from them. We may suppose this to be one of those moments of which the prophet says, in His name, "Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain" (Isa 49:4): Lo, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree; and what is it? As the result of all, I am taken for John the Baptist, for Elias, for Jeremias, for one of the prophets. Yet some there are that have beheld My glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, and I shall hear their voice, for it is sweet.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am? Without taking any further notice, or making any reflections on the different sentiments of men concerning him, he put this question to his disciples, and which is what he had chiefly in view, that he might have their sense of him; and which he puts in a different form, and leaves out the phrase, the son of man, because they knew he was more than a man: nor was his mean appearance an offence to them; they had believed in him, became his disciples, and were followers of him: but it was not enough to believe in him, they must confess him; both are necessary: therefore he does not say, whom believe ye, but whom say ye that I am? You who have been with me so long from the beginning; you who have heard so many discourses from me, and have seen so many miracles wrought by me; and who are to be the teachers of others, to preach my Gospel, and publish my salvation to Jews and Gentiles, what have you to say of me? Whom do you say I am? as for those men, it is no great matter who they say I am; but of great moment and consequence are your sense and confession of me. Such who have long sat under a Gospel ministry, or who have been long in the church and school of Christ, it is expected of them, that they should know more of Christ than others; and should be come to a point about his person and office, and be ready to make a confession of their faith, and give a reason of their hope in him; and especially such who are, or are to be preachers of Christ to others: these ought to be well acquainted with him, who, and what he is; they should have no doubt, nor hesitation in their minds, about him, but be fully satisfied concerning him; and be free, and open, and ready to declare what they know and believe of him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/16-15.htm" title="He said to them, But whom say you that I am?...">Matthew 16:15-16</a>. <span class="ital">New question and answer</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But whom</span> (<span class="accented">who</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>say ye that I am?</span> More emphatic in the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">But ye, who do ye say that I am?</span> This was the important question to which the previous one led.
