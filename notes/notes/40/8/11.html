Either he did not know of them, and then we must infer the entire independence of his record, or knowing them, he, writing for Gentiles, thought it best to omit words here which our Lord had afterwards repeated, and which he had therefore another opportunity of recording (<a href="/luke/13-28.htm" title="There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.">Luke 13:28</a>).

From this exalted pitch of faith, found in a heathen, Jesus took occasion to declare the merciful purpose which God entertained toward all the Gentiles, namely, that he would accept their faith as readily as the faith of the Jews, and admit them, with the founders of the Jewish nation, to the privileges and blessings of his kingdom. <span class="ital">Many, </span>says he, <span class="ital">shall come from the east and west, </span>&c. — Many, from the farthest parts of the earth, shall embrace the terms, and enjoy the rewards, of the gospel covenant established with Abraham. But the Jews, who have the first title to them, shall be shut out from the feast; from grace here, and glory hereafter. The words, <span class="greekheb">ανακλιθησονται μετα Αβρααμ</span>, &c., properly signify, <span class="ital">shall sit down at table with Abraham, </span>&c., a phraseology often used in Scripture, which represents the present privileges and future rewards of the righteous, and especially the latter, under the idea of a sumptuous entertainment. See <a href="/luke/14-15.htm" title="And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.">Luke 14:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>. And, though the joys of heaven be all of a spiritual kind, this metaphor needs not be thought strange, since, as Le Clerc observes, “we can neither speak ourselves, nor understand others speaking of our state in the life to come, unless phrases taken from the affairs of this life be made use of.” <span class="ital">But the children of the kingdom </span>— So he terms the Jews, even the unbelieving Jews, because they had been born and brought up within the pale of the visible Church, and enjoyed all the advantages which it afforded its members: <span class="ital">shall be cast out into outer darkness — </span>Our Lord here alludes to the custom which the ancients had of making their great entertainments, for the most part, in the evening, with candlelight. And the <span class="ital">outer darkness, </span>or darkness without the house, signifies, 1st, the state of heathenish darkness, or of ignorance and error, in which those are who are without the pale of the Church of God, and into which, it is here foretold, the Jews should be cast for their rejection of Christ; and, 2d, the state of future misery, into which, as many of them as continued till death in impenitence and unbelief, should finally be cast, with all hypocrites and unbelievers. <span class="ital">And Jesus said, Go thy way, </span>&c. — Having spoken, as observed above, he dismissed the centurion with an assurance that his servant was well; and at the same time intimated that the miracle had been wrought in consequence of, and according to, his <span class="ital">faith, </span>which, though not the meritorious cause of the cure, had been the means through which the Lord Jesus had been pleased to effect it. <span class="ital">And his servant was healed in the self-same hour </span>— Or, rather, <span class="ital">in that instant, </span>as <span class="greekheb">εν τη ωρα εκεινη</span>, here evidently means.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier, yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse for unbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and a full command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a master over his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must go and come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals of his providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith, therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us to be called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and have nothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure of his disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What was said to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healing of our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in the blood of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many shall come from the east ... - Jesus takes occasion from the faith of a Roman centurion to state that this conversion would not be solitary; that many pagans - many from the east and west would be converted to the gospel, and be saved, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were. The phrase "from the east and from the west," in the Scripture, is used to denote the "whole world," <a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>. The phrase, "shall sit down," in the original, refers to the manner of sitting at meals (see the notes at <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>); and the enjoyments of heaven are described under the similitude of a feast or banquet - a very common manner of speaking of it, <a href="/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>; <a href="/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>.

On occasion of the faith of the centurion, who was a Gentile, our Lord makes a short digression, concerning the call of the Gentiles; and suggests, that what was seen in that man now, would be fulfilled in great numbers of them in a little time: that many of them from the several parts of the world, from the rising of the sun to the setting of it, from the four points of the heaven, east, west, north, and south, as in <a href="/luke/13-29.htm">Luke 13:29</a> and from the four corners of the earth, should come and believe in him; <p>and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: signifying, that as the Gospel would be preached in a short time to all nations, many among them would believe in him, as Abraham, and the rest of the patriarchs did; and so would partake of the same blessings of grace with them; such as, adoption, justification, pardon of sin, and the like; for "they which be of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham", <a href="/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9</a> now, under the Gospel dispensation, though Gentiles; and shall enjoy with him the same eternal glory and happiness he does, in the other world. Which shows, that the faith of Old and New Testament saints, Jews and Gentiles, is the same; their blessings the same, and so their eternal happiness; they have the same God and Father, the same Mediator and Redeemer, are actuated and influenced by the same Spirit, partake of the same grace, and shall share the same glory. The allusion is to sitting, or rather lying along, which was the posture of the ancients at meals, and is here expressed, at a table, at a meal, or feast: and under the metaphor of a feast or plentiful table to set down to, are represented the blessings of the Gospel, and the joys of heaven; which are not restrained to any particular nation, or set of people; not to the Jews, to the exclusion of the Gentiles. Our Lord here, goes directly contrary to the notions and practices of the Jews, who thought it a crime to sit down at table, and eat with the Gentiles; see <a href="/acts/11-3.htm">Acts 11:3</a> and yet Gentiles shall sit at table and eat with the principal men, the heads of their nation, in the kingdom of heaven, and they themselves at the same time shut out. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</span><p>(a) A metaphor taken of banqueters, for they that sit down together are fellows in the banquet.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/8-11.htm" title="And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 8:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπὸ ἀνατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ δυσμ</span>.] from the most widely separated quarters of the world<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gentiles</span>.

The Hebrew idiom enables the writer to suggest the idea of the Jews, who are by nature heirs of the Divine kingdom, being notwithstanding excluded (cf <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be cast out</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">forth</span>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-4.htm">Matthew 7:4</a>, note).

The form of the expression, which comes only in Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>), points to a double conception; they shall be cast into the darkness, and cast outside the palace within which the feast is going on. Such is the loss in its personal (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and in its social (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) aspect. <span class="cmt_word">There shall be</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>weeping and gnashing of teeth</span>.

Observe the description of "hell" - absence of spiritual light; separation from the company of the saved; lamentation; impotent rage.
