The scribe had not counted the cost, and, like the young ruler that had great possessions, needed to be taught. To follow the Son of Man was not to be the adherent of a new sect or party, or the servant of a king marching onward to an earthly throne, but to share in poverty, privation, homelessness.<p><span class= "bld">Nests.</span>—The word is sufficient for popular use, but, strictly speaking, the “nest” belongs only to the brooding season of a bird’s life, and the Greek word has the wider meaning of “shelter.”<p><span class= "bld">The Son of</span> <span class= "bld">man.</span>—The passage is remarkable as the first in this Gospel in which the name occurs which was afterwards so prominent in our Lord’s teaching, and this is accordingly the right place for tracing the history and significance of that title.<p>As found in the Old Testament, the term is the literal translation of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ben-adam, the</span> latter word expressing the generic weakness and frailty of man’s nature, as the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ish</span> expresses its greatness and its strength. It stands therefore as representing man idealised under that one aspect of his being. “What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the <span class= "ital">son of man</span> that Thou visitest him?” (<a href="/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4</a>); “Put not your trust in princes, nor in <span class= "ital">the son of man</span> in whom is no help” (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm" title="Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.">Psalm 146:3</a>), are instances of its use in this meaning. In some passages our version expresses the same thought by rendering the “<span class= "ital">sons of Adam”</span> and the “<span class= "ital">sons of Ish</span> “as” low and high” (<a href="/psalms/49-2.htm" title="Both low and high, rich and poor, together.">Psalm 49:2</a>), or the former word alone as “men of low degree” (<a href="/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>). The title received a new prominence about the time of the Captivity from its use in Ezekiel’s prophecies. There it appears frequently (not fewer than eighty-seven times in all) as the title with which the prophet is addressed by the voice of Jehovah. We can scarcely doubt that it was used there in all the fulness of its earlier meaning, and was designed to teach the prophet that, amid all the greatness of his work, he was still subject to all the weakness and temptations of man’s nature, and ought therefore to have compassion on their infirmities. Yet a fresh aspect of the name was presented in the mysterious vision of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, in which “One like the <span class= "ital">Son of Man</span> came with the clouds of heaven, and was brought to the Ancient of Days, . . . and there was given unto Him dominion and glory and a kingdom.” The word used is not, it is true, <span class= "ital">benadam,</span> but <span class= "ital">bar-enosh,</span> but there is no traceable distinction of meaning between the two. Here, then, the thought manifestly was this, that One who shared man’s weakness, should also be a sharer of God’s glory, and be the Head of the divine kingdom. The prominence which the Maccabean struggles gave to the predictions of Daniel drew attention to the name as it had thus been used. The “Son of Man” became one of the titles of the expected Christ. The Targum or Paraphrase of the Psalms (probably earlier than our Lord’s ministry) explains even such a passage as <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm" title="Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.">Psalm 80:17</a> (“the son of man whom thou madest so strong for thine own self”) as referring to the Christ. So when the crowd at Jerusalem are questioning in their hearts whether Jesus was the Christ, they are not startled at this application of the name, and their question, “Who is this Son of Man?” is the utterance of their wonder that things so unlike what they expected of the Christ should be predicted of One who claimed the title (<a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>). It was accordingly, with these ideas attached to it—involving at once fellowship with the lowest of the heirs of our humanity, and yet also participation in the eternal glory of the Highest—that our Lord claimed the title, and used it with such marvellous frequency. We might almost say that it serves as the chief connecting-link between the teaching of the first three Gospels and the fourth. It appears thirty-two times in St. Matthew, fourteen in St. Mark, twenty-six in St. Luke, and twelve times in St. John. It is remarkable that it never passed into the current language of the Apostolic Church, nor into the theological or liturgical phraseology of Christendom. It is not used in any one of the Epistles. Outside the Gospels it is found only in the exclamation of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>), with a manifest reference to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, and possibly in the visions of the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>). The minds of believers loved to dwell on the glory of the risen Christ, and apparently looked on this as belonging rather to the time of His humiliation. Its absence from the other books of the New Testament, and its presence in the Gospels is, at all events, an indication that the latter were not the after-growth of a later age.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:18-22 One of the scribes was too hasty in promising; he proffers himself to be a close follower of Christ. He seems to be very resolute. Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And a certain scribe came ... - It is not improbable that this man had seen the miracles of Jesus, and had formed an expectation that by following him he would obtain some considerable worldly advantage. Christ, in reply to his professed purpose to follow him, proclaimed his own poverty, and dashed the hopes of the avaricious scribe. The very foxes and birds, says he, have places of repose and shelter, but the Son of man has no home and no pillow. He is a stranger in his own world - a wanderer and an outcast from the homes of people. Compare <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.<p>Son of man - This means, evidently, Jesus himself. No title is more frequently given to the Saviour than this, and yet there is much difficulty in explaining it. The word "son" is used in a great variety of significations. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. The name "Son of man" is given to Jesus only three times in the New Testament <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, except by himself. When he speaks of himself, this is the most common appellation by which he is known. The phrase "Son of God," given to Christ, denotes a unique connection with God, <a href="/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>. The name "Son of man" probably denotes a corresponding unique connection with man. Perhaps the Saviour used it to signify the interest he felt in man; his special love and friendship for him; and his willingness to devote himself to the best interests of the race. It is sometimes, however, used as synonymous with "Messiah," <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="/john/1-34.htm">John 1:34</a>; <a href="/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>; <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head&#8212;Few as there were of the scribes who attached themselves to Jesus, it would appear, from his calling Him Teacher, that this one was a "disciple" in that looser sense of the word in which it is applied to the crowds who flocked after Him, with more or less conviction that His claims were well founded. But from the answer which he received we are led to infer that there was more of transient emotion&#8212;of temporary impulse&#8212;than of intelligent principle in the speech. The preaching of Christ had riveted and charmed him; his heart had swelled; his enthusiasm had been kindled; and in this state of mind he will go anywhere with Him, and feels impelled to tell Him so. "Wilt thou?" replies the Lord Jesus. "Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head." How affecting is this reply! And yet He rejects not this man's offer, nor refuses him the liberty to follow Him. Only He will have him know what he is doing, and "count the cost." He will have him weigh well the real nature and the strength of his attachment, whether it be such as will abide in the day of trial. If so, he will be right welcome, for Christ puts none away. But it seems too plain that in this case that had not been done. And so we have called this the Rash or Precipitate Disciple.<p>II. The Procrastinating or Entangled Disciple (Mt 8:21, 22).<p>As this is more fully given in Luke (Lu 9:59), we must take both together. "And He said unto another of His disciples, Follow Me. But he said,"<p>Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead&#8212;or, as more definitely in Luke, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God" (Lu 9:60). This disciple did not, like the former, volunteer his services, but is called by the Lord Jesus, not only to follow, but to preach Him. And he is quite willing; only he is not ready just yet. "Lord, I will; but"&#8212;"There is a difficulty in the way just now; but that once removed, I am Thine." What now is this difficulty? Was his father actually dead&#8212;lying a corpse&#8212;having only to be buried? Impossible. As it was the practice, as noticed on Lu 7:12, to bury on the day of death, it is not very likely that this disciple would have been here at all if his father had just breathed his last; nor would the Lord, if He was there, have hindered him discharging the last duties of a son to a father. No doubt it was the common case of a son having a frail or aged father, not likely to live long, whose head he thinks it his duty to see under the ground ere he goes abroad. "This aged father of mine will soon be removed; and if I might but delay till I see him decently interred, I should then be free to preach the kingdom of God wherever duty might call me." This view of the case will explain the curt reply, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord, the key to it is the different senses&#8212;a higher and a lower&#8212;in which the same word "dead" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully alive; to the other, only the children of light: The reigning irreligion consists not in indifference to the common humanities of social life, but to things spiritual and eternal: Fear not, therefore, that your father will in your absence be neglected, and that when he breathes his last there will not be relatives and friends ready enough to do to him the last offices of kindness. Your wish to discharge these yourself is natural, and to be allowed to do it a privilege not lightly to be foregone. But the kingdom of God lies now all neglected and needy: Its more exalted character few discern; to its paramount claims few are alive: and to "preach" it fewer still are qualified and called: But thou art: The Lord therefore hath need of thee: Leave, then, those claims of nature, high though they be, to those who are dead to the still higher claims of the kingdom of grace, which God is now erecting upon earth&#8212;Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. And so have we here the genuine, but Procrastinating or Entangled Disciple.<p>The next case is recorded only by Luke:<p>III. The Irresolute or Wavering Disciple (Lu 9:61, 62).<p>  Lu 9:61:<p>  And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid   them farewell which are at home at my house.<p>  Lu 9:62:<p>  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and   looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. But for the very different   replies given, we should hardly have discerned the difference between this   and the second case: the one man called, indeed, and the other   volunteering, as did the first; but both seemingly alike willing, and only   having a difficulty in their way just at that moment. But, by help of what   is said respectively to each, we perceive the great difference between the   two cases. From the warning given against "looking back," it is evident   that this man's discipleship was not yet thorough, his separation from the   world not entire. It is not a case of going back, but of looking back; and   as there is here a manifest reference to the case of "Lot's wife" (Ge   19:26; and see on [1236]Lu 17:32), we see that it is not actual return to   the world that we have here to deal with, but a reluctance to break with   it. The figure of putting one's hand to the plough and looking back is an   exceedingly vivid one, and to an agricultural people most impressive. As   ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred   the instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who   prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart.   The reference may be chiefly to ministers; but the application at least is   general. As the image seems plainly to have been suggested by the case of   Elijah and Elisha, a difficulty may be raised, requiring a moment's   attention. When Elijah cast his mantle about Elisha, which the youth quite   understood to mean appointing him his successor, he was ploughing with   twelve yoke of oxen, the last pair held by himself. Leaving his oxen, he   ran after the prophet, and said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and   my mother, and [then] I will follow thee." Was this said in the same   spirit with the same speech uttered by our disciple? Let us see. "And   Elijah said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee."   Commentators take this to mean that Elijah had really done nothing to   hinder him from going on with all his ordinary duties. But to us it seems   clear that Elijah's intention was to try what manner of spirit the youth   was of:&#8212;"Kiss thy father and mother? And why not? By all means, go home   and stay with them; for what have I done to thee? I did but throw a mantle   about thee; but what of that?" If this was his meaning, Elisha thoroughly   apprehended and nobly met it. "He returned back from him, and took a yoke   of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the   oxen (the wood of his ploughing implements), and gave unto the people, and   they did eat: then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto   him" (1Ki 19:19-21). We know not if even his father and mother had time to   be called to this hasty feast. But this much is plain, that, though in   affluent circumstances, he gave up his lower calling, with all its   prospects, for the higher and at that time perilous, office to which he   was called. What now is the bearing of these two cases? Did Elisha do   wrong in bidding them farewell with whom he was associated in his early   calling? Or, if not, would this disciple have done wrong if he had done   the same thing, and in the same spirit, with Elisha? Clearly not. Elisha's   doing it proved that he could with safety do it; and our Lord's warning is   not against bidding them farewell which were at home at his house, but   against the probable fatal consequences of that step; lest the embraces of   earthly relationship should prove too strong for him, and he should never   return to follow Christ. Accordingly, we have called this the Irresolute   or Wavering Disciple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 19,20. We have the same story in <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/9-57.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.">Luke 9:57</a>,58</span>; only Luke saith it was <span class="ital">as they went in the way; </span> and saith, <span class="ital">a certain man thus said unto him.</span> Matthew more particularly describeth the man from his office, or ordinary employment.

Our Saviour, knowing his heart, and that this resolution was either bottomed in his curiosity to see his miracles, or in a hope of some livelihood from him, fits him with an answer, letting him know what difficulties those that followed him must look to meet with. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The foxes have holes, &c.</span> Alas! thou dost not know what it is to follow me; my external condition is worse than that of <span class="ital">the birds of the air, </span> they have fixed nests, or the beasts of the earth, the worst of them have holes, but I have no fixed habitation on earth.

Knowing his heart, and the carnal and worldly views with which he acted; <p>the foxes have holes in the earth, where they hide themselves from danger, take their rest, and secure their whelps; <p>and the birds of the air have nests, where they sit, lay, and hatch their eggs, and bring up their young; <p>but the son of man has not where to lay his head, when he is weary, and wants rest and sleep, as he did at this time. So that though he was Lord of all, as being the mighty God; yet as "the son of man", a phrase, expressive both of the truth and meanness of his human nature, the most despicable of creatures in the earth and air, were richer than he. This he said, to convince the Scribe of his mistake; who expected much worldly grandeur and wealth, by becoming his disciple. When Christ styles himself "the son of man", it is no contradiction to his being God; nor any objection to trust and confidence in him, as the Jew (z) suggests; for he is truly and properly God, as well as really man, having two natures, human and divine, united in his person; so that he is, as was prophesied of him, Emmanuel, God with us, in our nature, God manifested in the flesh: and since he is so, it cannot be unlawful to trust in him; which it would be indeed, was he a mere man. The Jews ought not to object to this name and title of the "Messiah, the son of man": since he is so called, as their own writers and commentators acknowledge, in (a) <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a> and (b) <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. And whereas it is further urged against these words of Christ, that if he was God, why does he complain of want of place? Is not the whole world his, according to <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>? It may be replied, that it is very true, that the whole world is his, nor could he be in want of anything, as God; but yet, as man, for our sakes he became "poor", that we "might be rich": nor should this be any difficulty with a Jew, when they themselves say, as some have thought, if he (the Messiah) should come,   , "there's no place in which he can sit down" (c). Unless it be understood of Nebuchadnezzar, as the gloss explains it; let the learned inspect the place, and judge: the coming of the Messiah is immediately spoken of. <p>(z) R.

But this self-chosen title, the expression of His full Messianic consciousness, is not founded (Delitzsch, Kahnis, <span class="ital">Dogm</span>.

The whole depended, then, on whether those who were present when Jesus named Himself the Son of man would understand this predicate in Daniel’s sense or not. In himself, however, this <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of man</span>, whose form had been delineated in Daniel’s vision, was Jesus Himself, as the historical <span class="ital">reality</span>, in so far as in His person He who there appeared in heavenly form had <span class="ital">come down</span> to earth. As often, therefore, as Jesus, in speaking of Himself, uses the words, “the Son of man,” He means nothing else than “the Son of man in that prophecy of Daniel,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the Messiah.[433] But, behind the <span class="ital">consciousness</span> which led Him to appropriate to Himself this designation from Daniel, there was, at the same time, the correlative element of His <span class="ital">divine</span> Sonship, the necessary (in answer to Schleiermacher) conviction, more decidedly brought out in John, of His divine pre-existence (as Logos), the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of which He had left behind, in order, as the heavenly personage in Daniel’s vision, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ΥἹῸς ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΥ</span></span></span>, to appear in a form of existence not originally belonging to Him. And so far those are right, who, following the Fathers, have recognised (Grotius contradicted by Calovius) the Pauline <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΈΝΩΣΙς</span></span></span> in this self-designation, based as it is upon the consciousness of His pre-existent divinity. Comp. Chrysostom on <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>, where he says: Jesus has so named Himself <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠῸ Τῆς ἘΛΆΤΤΟΝΟς ΟὐΣΊΑς</span></span></span>; and Augustine, <span class="ital">de consens. ev</span>. ii. 1, who observes: in this we are taught “quid misericorditer dignatus sit esse pro nobis.” It is to import ideas historically inconsistent with Daniel 7, when, in spite of the definite nature of the expression in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, it has been so understood as if Christ meant thereby to describe Himself as <span class="ital">the man in the highest sense</span> of the word, as the second Adam, as the <span class="ital">ideal</span> of humanity (Herder, Böhme, Neander, Ebrard, Olshausen, Kahnis, Gess, Lange, Weisse, Beyschlag, Wittichen), or as <span class="ital">the</span> man toward whom, as its <span class="ital">aim</span>, the whole history of humanity since Adam has been <span class="ital">tending</span> (Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 81; Thomasius, <span class="ital">Chr. Per. u. Werk</span>, II. p. 15), or as the <span class="ital">true</span> man <span class="ital">renewed after the image of God</span> (Schenkel), as He who is filled with the whole fulness of God (Colani), and such like. Fritzsche supposes Jesus to have meant, <span class="ital">filius ille parentum humanorum, qui nunc loquitur, homo ille, quem bene nostis</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">ego</span>, and that, on the strength of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, the <span class="ital">Christians</span> were the first to ascribe to the words the signification of <span class="ital">Messiah</span>. This would only be conceivable if <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span> had happened to be a current self-designation <span class="ital">in general</span>, in which case it would not be necessary to presuppose a special historical reason why <span class="ital">Jesus</span> should so frequently have used the title in reference to Himself. Consequently Baur is likewise in error in thinking that the expression denotes <span class="ital">the man as such</span> who <span class="ital">stands aloof from nothing human, and esteems nothing human foreign to himself</span>. In like manner Holtzmann’s view, viz. that Jesus intends to describe His <span class="ital">central place in the circle</span> of the <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>, is at variance with the original meaning of the phrase as used in Daniel, and rests upon inferences from expressions which Jesus, while designated as above, has used in reference to Himself, which <span class="ital">predicates</span>, however, cannot determine the meaning of the <span class="ital">subject</span>. This, at the same time, in answer to Weizsäcker, p. 428 ff., who thinks that by that expression Jesus had endeavoured to bring His followers to a <span class="ital">higher spiritual conception of the Messiah</span>, for whom it was possible to appear <span class="ital">without royal splendour</span>. In <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρ</span>. He describes Himself as the great Messiah, and that in the form of a human life, but not specially as the <span class="ital">lowly</span>, self-humbling <span class="ital">servant of humanity</span> (Keim), or he who is <span class="ital">intimately bound up with humanity</span> (Gess, I. p. 186). According to the corresponding passages elsewhere, ideas of this sort are found first to emerge in predicates, and, as a rule, in the course of the context; which, however, is not the case here, where the main point is the <span class="ital">contrast</span>, as seen in the fact that He who is that son of man of the prophet’s vision has not where to lay His weary head. Finally, Holsten asserts what is contrary to the whole Christology of the New Testament, as well as irreconcilable with <a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a> f., when he says that <span class="ital">as Messiah of the</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span>, Jesus is Daniel’s <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹῸς ΤΟῦ ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΥ</span></span></span>, and that <span class="ital">as Messiah of the future</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> He passes over into the form of existence belonging to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹῸς ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, which latter He is in this present era of time, as being the Son of man, <span class="ital">destined</span> to become the Son of God. In the <span class="ital">analysis</span> of the phrase, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span> is to be understood neither of <span class="ital">Adam</span> (Gregory Nazienzen, Erasmus) nor of the <span class="ital">Virgin Mary</span> (Euth. Zigabenus), but, according to Dan. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, to be taken <span class="ital">generically;</span> so that, as far as the essential meaning goes, it is in no way different from the <span class="ital">anarthrous</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπου</span> in Daniel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟῦ ΤῊΝ ΚΕΦ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΛΊΝῌ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> a <span class="ital">resting-place</span>, a sleeping-place which He can call His own.

On <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>, see the notes on that passage.

Only let it be carefully observed that the expression, “the son of man,” is not directly synonymous with “the Messiah,” but acquired this definite meaning for others only when first they came to refer it, in Daniel’s sense, to Jesus, so that it did not <span class="ital">immediately</span> involve the idea of “the Messiah,” but came to do so through the application, on the part of believers, of Daniel’s prophetic vision. But we must avoid ascribing to this self-designation any <span class="ital">purpose of concealment</span> (Ritschl in <span class="ital">d. theolog. Jahrb</span>. 1851, p. 514; Weisse, Wittichen, Holtzmann, Colani, Hilgenfeld), all the more that Jesus so styles Himself in the hearing of His disciples (already in <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>).

And He so names Himself in the consciousness that in Him the above prediction has been <span class="ital">fulfilled</span>. For those, indeed, who did not share this belief, this designation of Himself continued, as well it might, to be mysterious and unintelligible, as <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm" title="When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?">Matthew 16:13</a>. But to suppose that Jesus has chosen it “to avoid the consequences of a haphazard Messianic title” (Holtzmann), would be to impute a calculating reserve which would scarcely be consistent with His character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/8-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.">Matthew 8:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ι</span>. Jesus distrusted the <span class="ital">class</span>, and the <span class="ital">man</span>, who might be better than the average, still he was a scribe. Christ’s feeling was not an unreasoning or invincible prejudice, but a strong suspicion and aversion justified by insight and experience. Therefore He purposely paints the prospect in sombre colours to prevent a connection which could come to no good.—<span class="greekheb">αἱ ἀλώπεκες</span>, etc.: a notable saying; one of the outstanding <span class="ital">logia</span> of Jesus, in style and spirit characteristic; not querulous, as if lamenting His lot, but highly coloured to repel an undesirable follower. Foxes have holes, and birds resting places, roosts (not nests, which are used only for breeding), <span class="ital">but</span>—<span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span>: a remarkable designation occurring here for the first time. It means much for the Speaker, who has chosen it deliberately, in connection with private reflections, at whose nature we can only guess by study of the many occasions on which the name is used. Here it seems to mean the man simpliciter (son of man = man in Hebrew or Syriac), <span class="ital">the unprivileged Man</span>: not only no exception to the rule of ordinary human experience in the way of being better off, but rather an exception in the way of being worse off; for the rule is, that all living creatures, even beasts, and still more men, have their abodes, however humble. If it be Messianic, it is in a hidden enigmatical way. The whole speech is studiously enigmatical, and calculated to chill the scribe’s enthusiasm. Was Jesus speaking in parables here, and hinting at something beyond the literal privations of His life as a wanderer with no fixed home? The scribe had his spiritual home in Rabbinical traditions, and would not be at ease in the company of One who had broken with them. Jesus had no place where He could lay His head in the <span class="ital">religion</span> of His time (<span class="ital">vide</span> my <span class="ital">With Open Face</span>, chap. 9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">the Son of man</span>] The origin of this expression as a Messianic title is found in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a> : “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with (in) the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him before him.” Hence to the Jews it would be a familiar designation of the Messiah—the King whose “everlasting dominion” is described in the next verse (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>).

The original phrase, "one like unto a son of man," was used in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, apparently as a symbol of the Jewish nation, to which was to be given supreme power. There is no evidence that it was understood of Messiah before our Lord employed it, but rather the re verse (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>, and especially Professor Stanton, 'Jewish and Christian Messiah,' pp. 109, 239, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>; yet see Professor Sunday, in <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, January, 1891; cf. further, <a href="/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>, note). Our Lord uses it here for the sake of the contrast it suggested to the lower creation. Man, the head of creation (as none would acknowledge more fully than this student of the Law), has in the person of the ideal Man not even the luxuries which correspond to those enjoyed by beasts and birds. Such was the love and self-abasement of the Restorer of creation (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath not where to lay his head</span>.

The nest is not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwelling-place, since the bird frequents the nest only during incubation. The Rev. retains nests, but puts lodging-places in the margin. </body></html>
