Three conclusions may fairly be received as all but certain. (1.) The independence of each record. It is scarcely conceivable that St. Mark or St. Luke would have departed so widely from St. Matthew’s order had they had his Gospel before them. (2.) The derivation of all three from earlier records, written or oral, each embracing some few acts or discourses of our Lord. (3.) The absence of any direct evidence as to the order of these events, so that each writer was often left to his own discretion, or to some internal principle of grouping.<p>In dealing with such cases, therefore, while the parallel narratives in the other Gospels will be noticed, so far as they make the record here more vivid and complete, there will seldom be any attempt to discuss elaborately the order in which they stand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he was come down from the mountain </span>— Where he had delivered the divine discourse contained in the preceding chapters; <span class="ital">great multitudes followed him </span>— To the town toward which he went, desirous, probably, of receiving further instruction from him, or of witnessing the performance of some of his miraculous acts. <span class="ital">And, behold, there came a leper </span>— Leprosies, in those countries, were seldom curable by natural means, any more than palsies or lunacy. It is likely, though this leper might not mix with the people: he had heard our Lord at a distance. <span class="ital">And worshipped him </span>— That is, kneeled, or fell down before him; <span class="ital">saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean </span>— Doubtless, he had seen or been informed of some of the miraculous cures which Christ had wrought. <span class="ital">Jesus put forth his hand and touched him </span>— Though leprosies were the most nauseous of all the distempers incident to the human body, and the most infectious, insomuch that the bare sight of a leper could not fail to raise a loathing in all who looked on him; nevertheless, Jesus, with great benignity, drew near and touched this man, and, instead of being polluted by touching him, cleansed the leper with his touch, and sent him away very joyful by reason of his cure, which rendered him agreeable to himself, and gave him access again to the society of men. <span class="ital">Immediately his leprosy was cleansed</span> — Immediately on Christ’s touching him, and saying, <span class="ital">I will, be thou clean</span> — How wonderful the power thus displayed! and how irresistible, one would suppose, must be the evidence, arising from such a fact, of the divine mission and authority of the person who performed such a cure; who restored, in a moment, to perfect soundness, the body of a man covered all over with the most loathsome disease imaginable! Observe, reader, the instruction which this miracle gives us. Our souls are by nature entirely overspread with the leprosy of sin, and where can we apply for help but to the healing power and recovering grace of this Divine Saviour? And be the malady ever so deep, spreading, or inveterate, we may surely adopt the words of this leper, and say, <span class="ital">Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. </span>And we have every reason to hope, if we so apply, that his compassion will be moved in our favour, and his power exerted for our cure.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1 This verse refers to the close of the foregoing sermon.

It is a very remarkable one. No theory of moral therapeutics will avail here to eliminate the miraculous element. Leprosy is not a disease of the nerves, amenable to emotional treatment, but of the skin and the flesh, covering the body with unsightly sores. The story occurs in all three Synoptics, and, as belonging to the triple tradition, is one of the best attested.

St. Matthew has given a lengthy summary of the teaching of the Christ, and he now supplements it by a summary of his daily work.

It carries on the thought of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in the last verse of the preceding chapter, and serves to introduce the following examples of sick folk; or, perhaps, it may be connected with the "great multitudes" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) of <a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>, coming, as the plural suggests (cf. also <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>) from the various places there enumerated. If we must combine this verse with <a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>, we must suppose our Lord to have descended the mountain, and to be passing through "one of the cities," coming (our ver. 5) afterwards to Capernaum, the "great multitudes" (cf. <a href="/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>)being drawn from the various cities through which he passed. The verse reminds us that the two sides of the Lord's life, preaching and work, were intimately connected. Men not only wondered at what they heard (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), they also followed him, and this led to occasions for the exercise of his practical activity. The result was that they wondered at his work (<a href="/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>), as they wondered at his preaching. </body></html>
