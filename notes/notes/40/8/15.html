The church of Rome, which forbids ministers to marry, goes contrary to that apostle upon whom they rest so much. He had his wife's mother with him in his family, which is an example to be kind to our relations. In spiritual healing, the Scripture speaks the word, the Spirit gives the touch, touches the heart, touches the hand. Those who recover from fevers, commonly are weak and feeble some time after; but to show that this cure was above the power of nature, the woman was at once so well as to go about the business of the house. The miracles which Jesus did being noised abroad, many thronged to him. He healed all that were sick, though the patient was ever so mean, and the case ever so bad. Many are the diseases and calamities to which we are liable in the body; and there is more, in those words of the gospel, that Jesus Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, to support and comfort us under them, than in all the writings of the philosophers. Let us not grudge labour, trouble, or expense in doing good to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This account is contained also in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29-31</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38-41</a>. Mark says that Simon and Andrew lived together, and that James and John went with them to the house. He adds, also, that before the miracle they spake to him about the sick person. The miracle was direct and complete. She that had been sick was so completely restored as to attend to them and minister to them. The mention of "Peter's wife's mother" proves that Peter either then was or had been married. The fair and obvious interpretation is, that his wife was then living. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>, and see the note at that place. Peter is claimed by the Roman Catholics to be the head of the church and the vicegerent of Christ. The Pope, according to their view, is the successor of this apostle. On what pretence do they maintain that it is wrong for "priests" to marry? Why did not Christ at once reject Peter from being an apostle for having a wife? How remarkable that he should be set up as the head of the church, and an example and a model to all who were to succeed him! But all this is human law, and is contrary to the New Testament.

It is plain from this text, that Peter was a married man, and continued so though called to be an apostle, and that he had a family. Fevers are ordinary distempers, and often cured by ordinary means, but this was a great fever. The miracle here was not in the cure of an incurable disease, but in the way of the cure, by a touch of his hand, or a lifting her up; and the suddenness of the cure, it immediately left her; and her sudden recovery of strength, that she could presently arise and minister to them: that she could do it, argued her cure miraculous; that she did do it, argues her sense of Christ’s goodness, and thankfulness, and teacheth us the use we should make of all God’s gracious providences to us, to make us fitter for the service of God, and to employ ourselves in it; so taking <span class="ital">the cup of salvation, </span> and praising <span class="ital">the name of the Lord, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/116-13.htm" title="I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.">Psalm 116:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he touched her hand,.... Sometimes he healed by a word, as the centurion's servant; and sometimes by a touch, as here; and sometimes by both, as the leper.

Just as he did the winds and sea, having all diseases, as well as the elements, at his beck and control; <p>and the fever left her immediately, as the other evangelists say. <p>And she arose and ministered unto them: the former of these actions is a proof of her being restored to health and strength, in so much that she could rise and walk about of herself; whereas generally, persons after fevers continue very weak a considerable time; which shows what a miracle was wrought upon her by Christ: and the latter of them expresses her gratitude, for the mercy she had received; she rises and serves him and his friends, preparing proper and suitable provisions for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/8-15.htm" title="And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them....">Matthew 8:15-16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διηκόνει</span>] at table, <a href="/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>; <a href="/luke/10-40.htm" title="But Martha was encumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.">Luke 10:40</a>.

By this time the report of the miraculous cure had spread throughout the whole place; hence the crowds that now throng Him with their sick,—a fact which accords but ill with the attempt to destroy or weaken the supernatural character of the act (“mitigating of the fever,” and that by gentle soothing words or a sympathetic touch of the hand, Keim, comp.

Nor did the Lord warn the mother-in-law of Peter, as He did others, on that head: and if she had been attacked by fever anew, it would have happened at a most brief interval after the former cure, and therefore in that case the disciples, who were as yet but novices, might have doubted, along with others, whether the fever (a disease liable to alternations and intermissions more than all other diseases) had been really and completely removed.—<span class="ital">Harm</span>. p. 257.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he touched her hand</span>.
