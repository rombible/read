The Sinless One had no sin to confess, no need of repentance. We cannot even ascribe to Him that consciousness of evil which weighs upon the hearts of the saints of God almost in exact proportion to their holiness; yet we must believe that His righteousness was essentially human, and therefore capable of increase, even as He increased in wisdom and stature. Holy as He was at every stage of life in proportion to its capacities, there yet rose before Him height upon height of holiness as yet unattained, and after which we may say with reverence He “hungered and thirsted.” And for that attainment the baptism, which to others was a stepping-stone out of the slough of despond, might well seem a means, if not a condition. It was meet that He should fill up the full measure of righteousness in all its forms by accepting a divine ordinance, even, perhaps, <span class= "ital">because</span> it seemed to place Him in fellowship with sinners.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-13.htm" title="Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.">Matthew 3:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then cometh Jesus </span>— Who was now about thirty years of age, <span class="ital">from Galilee </span>— Where he had long lived, in a retired manner, <span class="ital">unto John, to be baptized of him </span>— Not in testimony of his repentance, or for the remission of sins, for, being without sin, he neither needed repentance nor remission; but that he might honour John’s ministry, and acknowledge his commission to baptize, and might confirm the institution of baptism by water. He thus, also, offered himself to receive that testimony which he knew his heavenly Father would give him, and conformed himself to what he appointed for his followers; for which last reason he drank likewise of the sacramental cup. Thus the apostolical constitutions inform us that Christ was baptized, <span class="ital">not that he needed any purgation, but to testify the truth of John’s baptism, and to be an example to us. </span>We may consider this as a plain argument that baptism may be rightly administered to, and received by those that are incapable of many of the chief ends of it, provided they be capable of some other end for which it also was designed. For Christ, being <span class="ital">without sin, </span>could neither repent nor promise amendment of life; being <span class="ital">the wisdom of the Father, </span>he could be taught nothing; being <span class="ital">the Christ, </span>he could not profess he would <span class="ital">believe </span>on <span class="ital">him that should come after him, </span>that is, on himself. He, therefore, was baptized, 1st, to testify that he owned the Baptist as one commissioned by God to perform this office; 2d, that by this rite he might profess <span class="ital">his willingness to fulfil all righteousness; </span>and, 3d, that by this he might be initiated into his <span class="ital">prophetical office, </span>and consecrated to the service of God. Therefore, though infants can neither be <span class="ital">taught, </span>nor <span class="ital">believe, </span>nor give the <span class="ital">answer of a good conscience, </span>at baptism, yet they may be baptized; 1st, that by this ceremony they may be obliged to observe the laws of that Jesus, into whose name they are baptized, even as, under the Mosaic dispensation, the infant, by virtue of circumcision, <span class="ital">became a debtor to observe the whole law of Moses, </span><a href="/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-3.htm" title="For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.">Galatians 5:3</a>; Galatians 2 dly, that by this rite they may enter into covenant with God, of which they are declared capable by Moses, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-11.htm" title="Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-17 Christ's gracious condescensions are so surprising, that even the strongest believers at first can hardly believe them; so deep and mysterious, that even those who know his mind well, are apt to start objections against the will of Christ. And those who have much of the Spirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ for more. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him, yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a state of humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him to fulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In and through Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. This descent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with his sacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the three Persons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to be Mediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spirit descending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to his people. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is the altar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then cometh Jesus - The Saviour is now introduced as about to enter on his work, or as about to be solemnly set apart to his great office of Messiah and Redeemer. The expression "cometh" implies that the act was voluntary on his part; that he went for that purpose and for no other. He left the part of Galilee - Nazareth - where he had lived for nearly 30 years, and went to the vicinity of the Jordan, where John was baptizing the people in great numbers, that he might be set apart to his work. The occasion was doubtless chosen in order that it might be as public and solemn as possible. It is to be remembered, also, that it was the main purpose of John's appointment to introduce the Messiah to the world, <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>.<p>To be baptized of him - By him. Baptism was not in his case a symbol of personal reformation and repentance, for he was sinless; but it was a solemn rite by which he was set apart to his great office. It is true, also, that although he was personally holy, and that the baptism in his case had a different signification, in this respect, from that which is implied when it is administered now, yet that even in his case the great idea always implied in the ordinance of baptism had a place; for it was a symbol of holiness or purity in that great system of religion which he was about to set up in the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 3:13-17.

Not so this greater than Moses. All but thirty years had He now spent in privacy at Nazareth, gradually ripening for His public work, and calmly awaiting the time appointed of the Father. Now it had arrived; and this movement from Galilee to Jordan is the step, doubtless, of deepest interest to all heaven since that first one which brought Him into the world. Luke (Lu 3:21) has this important addition&#8212;"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus being baptized," &c.&#8212;implying that Jesus waited till all other applicants for baptism that day had been disposed of, ere He stepped forward, that He might not seem to be merely one of the crowd. Thus, as He rode into Jerusalem upon an ass "whereon yet never man sat" (Lu 19:30), and lay in a sepulchre "wherein was never man yet laid" (Joh 19:41), so in His baptism, too. He would be "separate from sinners."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ, who now was about thirty years of age, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a></span>, cometh from Nazareth, a city in Galilee, where Joseph lived, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-4.htm" title="And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)">Luke 2:4</a></span>, and whither he went with, Joseph and Mary, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-39.htm" title="And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.">Luke 2:39</a></span>, and again after he had disputed with the doctors at twelve years of age, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-46.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.">Luke 2:46</a></span>; cometh from thence to Jordan, the great river, where John was baptizing disciples, offering himself to be baptized of him. He showed his humility by going to him, and also made the action public.

He thus owned John’s ministry and mission to baptize, and confirmed the institution of baptism by water, and offered himself to that testimony which he knew his Father would give of him. He thus initiated himself in the Christian church, as by circumcision he had made himself of the Jewish church, and so was the Head both of the believing Jews and Gentiles. He was not (as others) baptized in testimony of his repentance, or for the remission of sins, for he was without sin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then cometh Jesus,.... That is, when John had been some time preaching the doctrine of repentance, and administering the ordinance of baptism; for which, time must be allowed, since he went into all the country about Jordan, and preached unto them, and baptized such large numbers: very probably it might be six months from his first entrance on his ministry; since there was this difference in their age, and so might be in their baptism and preaching. Now when John had given notice of the Messiah's coming, and so had prepared his way; had declared the excellency of his person, the nature of his work, and office, and had raised in the people an expectation of him, <p>then cometh Jesus from Galilee; from Nazareth of Galilee, <a href="/mark/1-9.htm">Mark 1:9</a> where he had lived for many years, as the Jews (q) themselves own; in great obscurity, in all obedience to God, in subjection to his parents, exercising a conscience void of offence towards God and man, and employing his time in devotion and business: from hence he came to Jordan to John, who was baptizing there; which shows the great humility of Christ, who comes to John, and does not send for him, though John was his servant, and he was his Lord and Master; and also his cheerful and voluntary subjection to the ordinance of baptism, since of himself, of his own accord, he took this long and fatiguing journey; for Nazareth, according to David de Pomis (r), was three days journey from Jerusalem, though somewhat nearer Jordan; the end and design of his coming was <p>to be baptized of him. It may reasonably be inquired what should be Christ's view in desiring to be baptized; it could not be to take away original or actual sin, since he had neither; nor has baptism any such efficacy to do this, in those who have either or both: but, it was to show his approbation of John's baptism, and to bear a testimony of it, that it was from heaven; and also that he himself might receive a testimony both from heaven, and from John, that he was the Son of God and true Messiah, before he entered upon his public ministry, into which he was in some measure initiated and installed hereby; and moreover, to set an example to his followers, and thereby engage their attention and subjection to this ordinance; and, in a word, as he himself says, to fulfil all righteousness. <p>(q) Toldos Jesu, p. 6.

The opinion also of Schleiermacher, that the baptism of Jesus was the <span class="ital">symbolical beginning of His announcement of Himself</span>, and, at the same time, a <span class="ital">recognition of John’s mission</span>, is foreign to the text. The true meaning appears from <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>, namely, <span class="ital">because Jesus was consciously certain that He must, agreeably to God’s will, subject Himself to the baptism of His forerunner, in order</span> (<a href="/context/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:...">Matthew 3:16-17</a>) <span class="ital">to receive the Messianic consecration;</span> that is, <span class="ital">the divine declaration that He was the Messiah</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀναδειχθῇ τῷ λαῷ</span>, Euth. Zigabenus), <span class="ital">and thereby to belong from that moment solely and entirely to this great vocation</span>. The Messianic consciousness is not to be regarded as first commencing in Him at the baptism, so that He would be inwardly born, by means of baptism, to be the Messiah, and would become conscious of His divine destination, to full purification and regeneration as the new duty of His life; but the <span class="greekheb">πρέπον ἐστὶν ἡμῖν</span>, <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>, presupposes a clear certainty regarding His vocation; and John’s relation to the same, as in general the existence of that consciousness, must have been the necessary result of His own consciousness, which had attained the maturity of human development, that He was the Son of God. But that baptism, to which He felt certain that He must submit Himself, was to be for Him the <span class="ital">divine ordination to the Messiahship</span>. It is clear, according to this, that <span class="ital">His</span> baptism was quite <span class="ital">different</span> from that of others, so far as in Him, as a sinless being, there could be no confession of sin; but the lustrative character of the baptism could only have <span class="ital">the</span> meaning, that from that moment He was taken away from all His previous relations of life which belonged to the earthly sphere, and became, altogether and exclusively, the Holy One of God, whom the Father consecrated by the Spirit. Although He was this God-sanctified One from the beginning, yet now, as He was aware that this was the will of God, He has, by the assumption of baptism, solemnly bound and devoted Himself to the full execution of His unique destiny,—a <span class="ital">devotion</span> which was already more than a <span class="ital">vow</span> (Keim), because it was the actual entrance into the Messianic path of life, which was to receive at the very threshold its divine legitimation for all future time. In so doing, He could, without any consciousness of guilt (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>), associate Himself, in all humility (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>), with the multitude of those whom the feeling of guilt impelled to baptism; because in His own consciousness there was still the negation of absolute moral goodness, to which He, long afterwards, expressly gave so decided expression (<a href="/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/3-13.htm" title="Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him....">Matthew 3:13-17</a>. <span class="ital">Jesus appears, His baptism and its accompaniments</span> (<a href="/context/mark/1-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan....">Mark 1:9-11</a>; <a href="/context/luke/3-21.htm" title="Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,...">Luke 3:21-22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Then cometh Jesus … to be baptized of him</span>] Jesus who is the pattern of the New life submits to the baptism which is a symbol of the New life (<span class="ital">Metanoia</span>).
