It established John’s mission, great honour being done him by the Messiah’s receiving his baptism. It established our Lord’s mission also; for after he was baptized, the testimonies of the Spirit and voice from heaven were given him in the presence of the multitude assembled at Jordan. That these testimonies should have been given on this occasion, rather than on any other, was fit; because it was an august manner of opening our Lord’s ministry, was the most public occasion that could be found, and pointed him out as Messiah to the Baptist, who was thereby qualified for the principal duty of his mission, <a href="/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>.” By this we are taught a holy exactness in the observance even of those institutions which owe their obligations merely to a divine appointment. Surely thus <span class="ital">it becometh </span>all his followers <span class="ital">to fulfil all righteousness. </span>Jesus had no sin to wash away, and yet he was baptized.

And those who have much of the Spirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ for more. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him, yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a state of humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him to fulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In and through Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. This descent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with his sacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the three Persons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to be Mediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spirit descending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to his people. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is the altar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus it becometh us - It is suitable and proper. And though you may feel yourself unworthy, yet it is proper it should be done.<p>All righteousness - There was no particular precept in the Old Testament requiring this, but he chose to give the sanction of his example to the baptism of John, as to a divine ordinance. The phrase "all righteousness," here, is the same as a righteous institution or appointment. Jesus had no sin. But he was about to enter on his great work. It was proper that he should be set apart by his forerunner, and show his connection with him, and give his approbation to what John had done. He submitted to the ordinance of baptism, also, in order that occasion might be taken, at the commencement of his work, for God publicly to declare his approbation of him, and his solemn appointment to the office of the Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Indeed, if this be the meaning, our version perhaps best brings out the force of the opening word "Thus." But we incline to think that our Lord meant more than this. The import of circumcision and of baptism seems to be radically the same. And if our remarks on the circumcision of our Lord (see on [1218]Lu 2:21-24) are well founded, He would seem to have said, "Thus do I impledge Myself to the whole righteousness of the Law&#8212;thus symbolically do enter on and engage to fulfil it all." Let the thoughtful reader weigh this.<p>Then he suffered him&#8212;with true humility, yielding to higher authority than his own impressions of propriety.<p>Descent of the Spirit upon the Baptized Redeemer (Mt 3:16, 17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jesus said unto him, Suffer it to be so now.</span> The question is not whether thou or I be more excellent. It is thy duty to baptize, for my Father hath sent thee to baptize. It is my pleasure and duty to be obedient to my Father, whose will I know, though it be hidden from thee. Baptism is a new law of the gospel church, of which though I be the Head, yet I must be conformed to the members of it, concerning which my Father’s will is, that they should be baptized with water, as well as with the Holy Ghost. Besides that, I am to put an end to the Jewish typical circumcision, and to put a new face upon the church, by instituting another sacrament of initiation. It is therefore both just and equal that I should be baptized (though not for those ends for which others, that are my members, are baptized, not for remission of sins, but) for the fulfilling of all righteousness, in obeying my Father’s will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then he suffered him:</span> he that erreth through ignorance will correct his error upon better information. We may learn from this example of Christ, that being baptized with the Holy Ghost will excuse none for contempt or neglect of baptism by water, because it is the revealed will of God, that all the members of his church should come under that ordinance; so as there is a fulfilling of righteousness in our case, as well as in Christ’s, though in a different measure. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus answering, said unto him,.... This is an Hebrew way of speaking, often used in the Old Testament, and answers to  see <a href="/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>. He replied to John, who had made use of very forbidding words, after this manner, <p>suffer it to be so now; let me have my request; do not go on to object, but comply with my desire; let it be done now, immediately, directly, at this present time; do not put me off with any excuse; it is a proper season for it, even "now", since the time is not yet come that I am to baptize with the Holy Ghost; and besides, thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. It became John to administer the ordinance of baptism to Christ, as he was his forerunner, and the only administrator of it, and that he might fulfil the ministry which he had received; and as it became Christ to fulfil all righteousness, moral and ceremonial, and baptism being a part of his Father's will, which he came to do, it became him to fulfil this also. And since it became Christ, it cannot be unbecoming us to submit to this ordinance; and since he looked upon it as a part of righteousness to be fulfilled by him, it ought to be attended to by all those who would be accounted followers of him. Christ having strongly urged the conveniency and equity of the administration of baptism to him, which showed his eager desire after it, and the lowliness of his mind; and John being convinced, and overcome by the force of his reasoning, agrees to his baptism; <p>then he suffered him, i.e. to be baptized in water by him, as he had requested, and accordingly did administer it to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer <i>it to be so</i> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> all righteousness.

Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>. The reasoning with which Jesus replies to John’s scruples is characteristic. His answer is gentle, respectful, dignified, simple, yet deep.—<span class="greekheb">Ἄφες ἄρτι</span>—deferential, half-yielding, yet strong in its very gentleness. Does <span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span> imply a tacit acceptance of the high position assigned to Him by John (Weiss-Meyer)? We may read that into it, but I doubt if the suggestion does justice to the feeling of Jesus.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτω γὰρ πρέπον</span>: a mild word when a stronger might have been used, because it refers to John as well as Jesus: fitting, becoming, congruous; <span class="ital">vide</span> <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, where the same word is used in reference to the relation of God to Christ’s sufferings. “It became Him.”—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην</span>: this means more than meets the ear, more than could be explained to a man like John. The Baptist had a passion for righteousness, yet his conception of righteousness was narrow, severe, legal. Their ideas of righteousness separated the two men by a wide gulf which is covered over by this general, almost evasive, phrase: all righteousness or every form of it. The special form meant is not the mere compliance with the ordinance of baptism as administered by an accredited servant of God, but something far deeper, which the new era will unfold. John did not understand that love is the fulfilling of the law. But he saw that under the mild words of Jesus a very earnest purpose was hid. So at length he yielded—<span class="greekheb">τότε ἀφίησιν αὐτόν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">righteousness</span>] Here = the requirements of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.

The word <span class="greekheb">ἀφίησιν</span>, <span class="ital">he permits</span>, at the end of the verse, refers to this.—<span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span>, now) sc. without delay, this once.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτω</span>, <span class="ital">thus</span>) as I have come to thee.—<span class="greekheb">πρέπον</span>, <span class="ital">becoming</span>) That, which did not to John appear becoming, was in reality especially so, because it was righteous. The propriety which is manifested in all the counsels and works of God, claims our attention and admiration. See <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>. The discourses and actions of Christ are pre-eminently conspicuous for that propriety, which, so well expressed by the Evangelists, affords a proof that they wrote under the impulse of the Holy Spirit, since it could not have been the product of human genius, however exalted.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to us</span>) Our Lord speaks as if He were not yet fully known by John. It becomes <span class="ital">Me</span>, as the principal; <span class="ital">thee</span>, as the minister. In the mind of Jesus it might also have this sense, “It becomes Me and My Father that I should fulfil all righteousness.” See <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>, and cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πληρῶσαι</span>, <span class="ital">to fulfil</span>) all righteousness. This is effected, not by John and Jesus, but by Jesus alone, who undertook that very thing in His baptism; whence the appellation, “<span class="ital">baptism</span>,” is transferred also to His passion, <a href="/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην</span>, <span class="ital">all righteousness) i.e.</span> all the component parts of righteousness; and therefore this part also, the earnest of the other greater parts. In accordance with the <span class="ital">particular</span> view of righteousness, it would seem that John should be baptized by Jesus: in accordance with the <span class="ital">universal</span> compass of righteousness, the matter was inverted. Jesus uttered the words here recorded, instead of that which others who were baptized, being sinners, confessed concerning their <span class="ital">sins</span>. Such a speech suited none save the Messiah Himself. In matters even the most humble, the Son of God watches over the right of His own majesty. See <a href="/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>, seqq., <a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>, <a href="/john/18-5.htm" title="They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.

Compare Melchizedek and Abraham; the representative of the older blesses the representative of the coming age (<a href="/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Us</span>; thee and me. <span class="cmt_word">To fulfil</span>; here only with "righteousness" (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). Not the whole circle of righteousness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), but every part of righteous ness, as each is presented to us (similarly, <a href="/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>; cf. also <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in Ecclus. 44:10; Tobit 2:14, where, although Neubauer and Fuller explain it as "alms." this is improbable after the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and that not merely every part of the righteousness included under the Mosaic, Law (cf. Alford, "requirements of the Law' and especially Lowe. 'Pesach Fragm.,' p. 100: 1879), but of that wider righteousness of which that was itself only a part and a type. "Let me be baptized by thee now," our Lord says to John, "for it is fitting for us, in this spirit of submission, to fill up every part of righteousness." Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> thus pleads for the absolute submission of John and himself to every portion of righteousness as it may be proposed to them by God to perform; his words thus somewhat resembling those to St. Peter, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" (<a href="/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>). Thy duty is to baptize, mine to be baptized. It has generally been thought that in this verse our Lord implies that his baptism was to constitute his own formal recognition and acceptance of his distinctly Messianic duties - an act which involved the complete leaving of his past life and the giving himself up to a new and public life (cf. Weiss, 'Life,' 1:322). But have we any evidence that our Lord came to the baptism with this self-consciousness? May he not very well have known that he was to be the Messiah, and yet not have known that his official life was to begin now? May  he not have come to the baptism merely as an individual, feeling the deepest interest in this consecration to the cause of the kingdom, notwithstanding the unique position in which he knew himself to stand with regard to that kingdom? But his voluntary consecration of himself for whatever he might be guided to, was the opportunity taken by the Father for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, which had as its immediate consequence the retirement into the wilderness and the decision there come to. May not, in other words, our Lord's descent into Jordan have been, not the first act of his public life, but the last act of his private life - the former then being the withdrawal into the wilderness, in order there to have uninterrupted communion with his Father, and to meet in his official character his great adversary (cf. especially Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:279, etc.)? </body></html>
