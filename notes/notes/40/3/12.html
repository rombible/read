The metaphor was a sufficiently familiar one. (Comp. <a href="/job/21-18.htm" title="They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away.">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-3.htm" title="Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.">Hosea 13:3</a>.) The new features here are (1) that the “coming One,” the expected Christ, is to be the agent in the process; (2) that the Old Testament imagery rests in the “scattering” of the chaff, and this passes on to the “burning”; (3) that the fire is said to be “unquenched,” or perhaps “unquenchable.” The interpretation of the parable lies on the surface. The chaff are the ungodly and evildoers. The unquenched fire is the wrath of God against evil, which is, in its very nature, eternal, and can only cease with the cessation or transformation of the evil. The word translated “chaff” includes, it may be noted, straw as well, all but the actual grain.<p>It seems right briefly to direct the reader’s thoughts here to what is recorded of the Baptist’s ministry in the other Gospels; the questions of the priests and Levites (<a href="/context/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19-25</a>); the counsels given to publicans, soldiers, and others (<a href="/context/luke/3-10.htm" title="And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?">Luke 3:10-14</a>); the presence, among the crowd, of Galileans, some of whom were afterwards Apostles (<a href="/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35-42</a>). A curious legendary addition, found in the Apocryphal Gospel according to the Hebrews, is worth noting, as preparing the way for what follows: “Behold, the mother of the Lord and his brethren said unto Him, ‘John the Baptist baptiseth for the remission of sins; let us go that we may be baptised by him.’ But He said unto them, ‘In what have I sinned that I should go and be baptised by him? unless, perhaps, even that which I have thus spoken be a sin of ignorance.’ “This was obviously an attempt to explain the difficulty of the Sinless One seeking a baptism of repentance. It was, of course, probable enough that the household of Nazareth, cherishing, as they did, hopes of the kingdom of heaven, should be drawn with other Galileans to the Baptist’s preaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whose fan is in his hand </span>— That is, the doctrine of the gospel, which is of such a nature as effectually discovers what is the real disposition of the hearts of men, and perfectly distinguishes between the hypocritical and the sincere. Perhaps, also, the Baptist might refer to the persecutions and tribulations which should attend the preaching of the gospel. Dr. Campbell renders the original expression, <span class="greekheb">το πτυον</span>, <span class="ital">winnowing shovel, </span>mentioned <a href="/isaiah/30-24.htm" title="The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.">Isaiah 30:24</a>, “an implement of husbandry, very ancient, simple, and properly manual: whereas the <span class="ital">fan, </span>(or <span class="ital">van, </span>as it is sometimes called,) is more complex, and, being contrived for raising an artificial wind, by the help of sails, can hardly be considered as proper for being carried about in the hand.” “In the eastern countries,” says Dr. Shaw, “after the grain is trodden out, they winnow it by throwing it up against the wind with a <span class="ital">shovel.</span>” “To understand the Baptist’s meaning aright, we should observe, that in this verse he describes the authority of Christ’s ministry, as in <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a> he had described its efficacy. As if he had said, The Messiah is infinitely mightier than I, not only as he will bestow on you the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, but as he has power to reward those who obey him with eternal life, and to punish such with everlasting destruction, as reject him.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">He will thoroughly purge his floor </span>— His Church, at present covered with a mixture of wheat and chaff. As if he had said, Though, for the present, the good and bad, the fruitful and unfruitful, are joined together in the visible Church, yet in due time he will sever them, <a href="/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:...">Malachi 3:2-3</a>; and rid his Church of all hypocrites and ungodly persons. <span class="ital">And gather his wheat </span>— The, truly pious, <span class="ital">into his garner</span> — Will lay them up in heaven as his peculiar treasure. <span class="ital">But the chaff </span>— Those who have only a show of religion, without the power, and produce not the fruits of righteousness, <span class="ital">he will burn with unquenchable fire </span>— He will treat them as men do the refuse of the floor. He will destroy them as worthless and unprofitable trash. There is, in these words, an evident allusion to the custom of burning the chaff after winnowing, that it might not, by the wind’s changing, be blown back again, and so be mingled with the wheat. And though this may in part refer to the calamities to come upon the Jewish nation for rejecting Christ, yet, it seems chiefly to intend the final destruction of all sinners in hell, which alone is properly opposed to the <span class="ital">gathering the wheat into the garner. </span>See <a href="/context/matthew/13-40.htm" title="As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world....">Matthew 13:40-42</a>. And certainly this <span class="ital">burning of the chaff with unquenchable fire, </span>is absolutely inconsistent with all views of the restoration of the wicked, nor can it, by any easy or just interpretation, be reconciled with their annihilation, which, it is certain, no punishment of mind or body can, of itself, effect.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life of preaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid their chief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier matters of the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies. Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences to holiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the opposite extreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. They were the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrath to come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath. God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy of the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry for their sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearances of sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges. There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say within themselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the word of God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages of their being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannot be made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christ graft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high in gifts and honours, however green in outward professions and performances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet for repentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. No outward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoever administered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansing power of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, and those holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh 7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ's floor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless and worthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good and bad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when the wheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be the distinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever. In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff among them. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be the portion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life and death, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in the field, we shall be then in the floor.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His fan - The word used here and rendered "fan" means a winnowing shovel instead. It was used for throwing the grain, after it was threshed, into the air, so that the chaff might be driven away by the wind. This mode of separating the grain from the chaff is still practiced in the East. It is not probable that the fan, as the term is now used, was known to the Orientals as an instrument for cleaning grain. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>.<p>His floor - The threshing-floor was an open space, or area, in the field, usually on an elevated part of the land, <a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>. It had no covering or walls. It was a space of ground 30 or 40 paces in diameter, and made smooth by rolling it or treading it hard. A high place was selected for the purpose of keeping it dry, and for the convenience of winnowing the grain by the wind. The grain was usually trodden out by oxen. Sometimes it was beaten with flails, as with us; and sometimes with a sharp threshing instrument, made to roll over the grain and to cut the straw at the same time. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>.<p>Shall purge - Shall cleanse or purify. Shall remove the chaff, etc.<p>The garner - The granary, or place to deposit the wheat.<p>Unquenchable fire - Fire that shall not be extinguished, that will utterly consume it. By the floor, here, is represented the Jewish people. By the wheat, the righteous, or the people of God. By the chaff, the wicked. They are often represented as being driven away like chaff before the wind, <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>. They are also represented as chaff which the fire consumes, <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>. This image is often used to express judgments, <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; "Thou shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff." By the unquenchable fire is meant the eternal suffering of the wicked in hell, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>; <a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Besides   what we read in Joh 1:29, 33, 34; 3:27-36, the incidental allusion to his   having taught his disciples to pray (Lu 11:1)&#8212;of which not a word is said   elsewhere&#8212;shows how varied his teaching was.<p>  Lu 3:19:<p>  But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother   Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done&#8212;In this last   clause we have an important fact, here only mentioned, showing how   thoroughgoing was the fidelity of the Baptist to his royal hearer, and how   strong must have been the workings of conscience in that slave of passion   when, notwithstanding such plainness, he "did many things, and heard John   gladly" (Mr 6:20).<p>  Lu 3:20:<p>  Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison&#8212;This imprisonment   of John, however, did not take place for some time after this; and it is   here recorded merely because the Evangelist did not intend to recur to his   history till he had occasion to relate the message which he sent to Christ   from his prison at Mach&aelig;rus (Lu 7:18, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Judea is at present God’s floor, the only church he hath upon the earth; but there is chaff upon this floor, as well as wheat.

The Jews had their hand fans, and which were like a man's hand; their names were ; which, as Maimonides says (n), were three sorts of instruments used in the floor, in form of a man's hand; with which they cleansed the wheat and barley from the straw; and their names differ according to their form: some have many teeth, and with them they cleanse the wheat at the end of the work; and there are others that have few teeth, no more than three, and with these they purge the wheat at first, from the thick straw. By the "fan", here is meant, either the Gospel which Christ was just ready to publish; by which he would effectually call his chosen people among the Jews, and so distinguish and separate them from others, as well as purify and cleanse them, or rather the awful judgment of God, which Christ was ready to execute, and in a short time would execute on the unbelieving and impenitent Jews: hence it is said to be "in his hand"; being put there by his Father, who "hath committed all judgment to the Son". That this is the meaning of the "Baptist", seems evident, since "fanning" is always, when figuratively taken, used for judgments, <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>. By "his floor", is meant the land of Israel, where he was born, brought up, and lived; of which the Lord says, "O my threshing, and the corn of my floor!" <a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>. This, he says, "he will thoroughly purge" of all his refuse and chaff, that is, by fanning: so fanning and cleansing, or purging, are joined together, <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a> so is used for purging by fanning, in the Misnic writings (o). By "his wheat", are meant his elect among the Jews, the chosen of God and precious; so called because of their excellency, purity, usefulness, solidity, and constancy: these he "will gather into his garner"; meaning either some place of protection, where he would direct his people to for safety from that wrath, ruin, and destruction; which should fall upon the Jewish nation; or else the kingdom of heaven, into which he would bring them, by taking them out of the world from the evil to come. By "the chaff", are meant wicked and ungodly persons, such as are destitute of the grace of God, whether professors, or profane; being empty, barren, and unfruitful; and so good for nothing but the fire, which therefore "he will burn with unquenchable fire", of divine wrath and vengeance: an allusion to a custom among the Jews, who, when they purified the increase of their unclean fields, gathered it together in an "area" or floor, in the midst of them, and then sifted it with sieves; one sort with two sieves, another with three, that they might thoroughly purge it, and burnt the chaff and stalks (p); see <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>. <p>(n) In Misn.

Keil, Arch. II. p. 114; Robinson, III. p. 370. Similarly in Greek writers; see Hermann, Privatalterth. xv. 6, xxiv. 3. The floor is cleansed in this way, that the seed grains and the pounded straw and similar refuse are not allowed to lie upon it indiscriminately mingled together, in the state in which the threshing has left this unclean condition of the floor, but the grain and refuse are separated from each other in order to be brought to the place destined for them. In the figure, the floor, which belongs to the Messiah, is not the church (Fathers and many others), nor mankind (de Wette), nor the Jewish nation (B. Crusius), but, because the place of the Messiah’s activity must be intended (Ewald), and that, according to the national determination of the idea of the Baptist, the holy land, as the proper sphere of the work of the Messiah, not the world in general (Bleek), as would have to be assumed according to the Christian fulfilment of the idea.

To relegate, however, the announcement of the Messiah from the preaching of the Baptist into the realm of <span class="ital">legend</span> (Strauss) is a mockery of the entire evangelical testimony, and places it below the narrative of Josephus, which was squared according to the ideas of political prudence (<span class="ital">Antt</span>. xviii. 5. 2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>.

The idea is: He with His fan will throw up the wheat, mixed with the chaff, that the wind may blow the chaff away; He will then collect the straw, <span class="greekheb">ἄχυρον</span> (in Greek writers usually plural <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἄχυρα</span>, <span class="ital">vide</span> Grimm), and burn it with fire, and collect the wheat lying on the threshing floor and store it in His granary. So shall He thoroughly (<span class="greekheb">δια</span> intensifying) cleanse His floor.

Not the barn that English-men think of, but an open and level space (for the figure, cf. especially <a href="/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>).

The <span class="accented">chaff</span> in Jeremiah includes the straw, for in the East everything except the actual grain is generally burnt, and is sometimes used for heating fireplaces (Mishna, 'Sabb.,' 3:1; 'Parah,' 4:3). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">unquenchable fire</span>. "Unquenchable" shows that John is here thinking not of the figure of <span class="accented">chaff</span> but of the persons figured by it. But what does the word mean? In itself it might mean that the fire cannot be overcome by the greatness or the nature of the mass that it has to consume; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to drop the figure, by either the number or the character at' the wicked.
