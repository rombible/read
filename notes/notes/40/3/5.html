All sorts and ranks of persons, and the generality of the people there, flocked to hear him. The uncommon circumstances of John’s public appearance could scarcely fail to awaken the attention of the people to his person and ministry, which would be yet more excited by the time of it: for the Roman yoke began to bear hard upon them, and their uneasiness under it raised in their minds the most impatient desire of the Messiah’s arrival, by whom they expected not only deliverance, but universal monarchy. No wonder, therefore, that they flocked to the Baptist from all parts, and listened attentively while he proclaimed this long-expected Messiah’s approach, and denounced the divine vengeance upon such as rejected him. Add to this, the novelty of a prophet’s appearance in Israel, (for it seems they had had none among them since Malachi’s time;) the family of John, the circumstances of his birth, and the extraordinary character he had no doubt maintained for strict and undissembled piety; the new doctrine he taught, and his fervent manner of urging it, together with the new rite of baptism which he brought in; — all concurred, with the cause mentioned above, to draw such vast multitudes after him. And, it appears, great numbers of them were brought under very serious impressions by his faithful remonstrances, expostulations, and warnings. Here we observe a remarkable difference between John and Jesus. That the people might hear John they were under the necessity of going out of the city, and travelling to him into the desert: but Jesus, of his own accord, went to his hearers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jerusalem - The people of Jerusalem.<p>All Judea - Many people from Judea.

The term <span class="ital">all</span> here twice repeated, is enough to let us know, that it is often in Scripture significative no further then <span class="ital">many, </span> for it cannot be imagined that every individual person in Jerusalem and the region about Jordan went to hear John the Baptist, but a great many did. It is not to be wondered that there went out such a concourse of people to hear John the Baptist, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. If it be true, that from Ezra’s time till now no prophet had appeared. Our Saviour speaking of John, <span class="ital">What went ye out for</span> <span class="ital">to see?

If we consider the new doctrine he brought, and his fervency in the pressing it: he came to preach the Messias, whom the Jews had long expected; to tell them his kingdom was at hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Especially if we consider the new rite of baptizing, which he brought in. For admit their washing of proselytes in use before, yet he baptized Jews.

So as from this time the institution of the sacrament of baptism must be dated, and he did baptize many. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then went out to him Jerusalem,.... The uncommon appearance of this person, the oddness of his dress, the austerity of his life, together with the awfulness and importance of his doctrine, and the novelty of the ordinance of baptism he administered, and the Jews having had no prophet for some hundreds of years, and imagining he might be the Messiah, quickly drew large numbers of people to him. Some copies read "all Jerusalem": that is, the inhabitants of that city, a very large number of them; and "all Judea", a great number of people from all parts of that country. "All" is here put for "many".

The country on both sides of the Jordan, now Elgor, see Robinson, Pal. II. p. 498 ff. Comp. Lightfoot, Hor. p. 216. The whole passage conveys an impression of solemnity, with which also the naming of the town and district, instead of the inhabitants (Nägelsbach on the Iliad, p. 103 ff. ed. 3), is connected. The baptism of John has been erroneously regarded as a modified application of the Jewish baptism of proselytes. So Selden (Jus. nat. <a href="/matthew/2-2.htm" title="Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.">Matthew 2:2</a>), Lightfoot (Hor. p. 220 ff.), Danz (in Meuschen, N.

Alter d. Jüd. Proselytent. 1814. For the baptism of proselytes, the oldest testimony to which occurs in the Gemara Babyl. Jebamoth xlvi. 2, and regarding which Philo, Josephus, and the more ancient Targumists are altogether silent, did not arise till after the destruction of Jerusalem. Schneckenburger, üb. d. Alter der Jüd. Proselytent. u. deren Zusammenst. m. d. joh. u. chr. Ritus, 1828; Paulus, exeg. Handb. I. p. 307 ff. The reception of proselytes was accomplished, so long as the temple stood, by means of circumcision and the presentation of a sacrifice, which was preceded, like every sacrifice, by a lustration, which the proselyte performed on himself. It is not, however, with this lustration merely, but chiefly with the religious usages of the Jews as regards washings, and their symbolical meaning (<a href="/genesis/35-2.htm" title="Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-7.htm" title="Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.">Numbers 19:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-19.htm" title="And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.">Numbers 19:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/12-7.htm" title="Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp.">Jdt 12:7</a>), that the baptism of John has its general point of connection in the history of the people, although it is precisely as baptism, and accompanied by the confession of sin, that it appears only as something new given to this dawn of the Messiah’s kingdom, under the excitement of the divine revelation, of which John was the bearer. Venerable prophetic pictures and allusions, like <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm" title="Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;">Isaiah 1:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, your redeemer, and he that formed you from the womb, I am the LORD that makes all things; that stretches forth the heavens alone; that spreads abroad the earth by myself;">Isaiah 44:24</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, <a href="/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>, might thus serve to develope it still further in the soul of this last of the prophets. What was symbolized in the baptism of John was the <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span>. Comp. Josephus, Antt. xviii. 5. 2.[380] To this, however, the immersion of the <span class="ital">whole</span> of the baptized person, as the <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span>, was to purify the whole man, corresponded with profound significance, and to this the specifically Christian view of the symbolic immersion and emersion afterwards connected itself (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a> ff.; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>) by an ethical necessity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΜΟΛΟΓ</span></span></span>.] In the same way as in the case of the sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm" title="And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:">Leviticus 16:21</a> ff.; <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm" title="Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.">Numbers 5:7</a>), and in general to be taken as a venerable pre-condition of divine grace and blessing, <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid.

Without any reason has this meaning been discovered in it, that John viewed his baptism as <span class="ital">a means of covenant</span>, by explaining <span class="greekheb">βαπτισμῷ συνιέναι</span> to mean: <span class="ital">to unite through</span> or <span class="ital">for</span> baptism (Strauss, Keim, Hausrath).

Remarkable by his appearance, his message, and his moral intensity, John made a great impression. They took him for a prophet, and a prophet was a novelty in those days. His message appealed to the common Messianic hope, and proclaimed fulfilment to be at hand.—<span class="greekheb">Τότε</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>, general note of time, frequent in this Gospel. <span class="greekheb">ἐξεπορεύετο</span> imperfect, denoting continued action. The movement of course was gradual. It began on a small scale and steadily grew till it reached colossal dimensions. Each evangelist, in his own way, bears witness to this. Luke speaks of crowds (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>), Mark and Matthew give graphic particulars, similar, but in diverse order. “All Judaea and all the Jerusalemites,” says Mark. “Jerusalem, Judaea and the Jordan country,” Matthew. The historical order was probably the reverse of that in Matthew’s narrative. First came those from the surrounding country—people living near the Jordan, on either side, in what is now called El-Ghor. Then the movement extended in widening circles into Judaea. Finally it affected conservative, disdainful Jerusalem, slow to be touched by new popular influences.—<span class="greekheb">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span>: the Greek form here as in <a href="/matthew/2-3.htm" title="When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.">Matthew 2:3</a>, and generally in this Gospel. It is not said <span class="ital">all</span> Jerusalem, as in Mark. The remarkable thing is that any came from that quarter. Standing first, and without the “all,” the reference means <span class="ital">even</span> Jerusalem. The <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα</span> in the other two clauses is of course an exaggeration. It implies, not that every human being went to the Jordan, but that the movement was <span class="ital">general</span>. The evangelist expresses himself just as we should do in a similar case. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶς</span> with the article means “the whole,” without, “every”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶσα</span>, <span class="ital">all) i.e.</span>, from all parts.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>.

The singular is used (as often in the Hebrew) because the writer's first thought was of Jerusalem; the other parts were added as an afterthought. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from all parts and in large numbers. <span class="cmt_word">Judaea</span>. Strictly speaking, this would, of course, include part of the next expression, but the reference here is especially to the hill-country. <span class="cmt_word">And all the region round about Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the inhabitants of the Ghor, the Jordan valley. They presumably came from either side of the river. "<span class="accented">Strabo</span>, concerning the plain bordering on <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, hath these words: <span class="accented">It is a place of an hundred furlongs</span>, <span class="accented">all well watered</span>, <span class="accented">and full of dwellings"</span>  (John Lightfoot, 'Her. Heb.'). </body></html>
