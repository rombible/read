and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), we have the word <span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span> repeated. The passage takes its place among the most conspicuous instances of the power of a word. Theories of church authority, as exercised by the priesthood, or bishops, or councils, or the personal infallibility of the Bishop of Rome, have been built upon it. The last clause has been made the groundwork of the system of church discipline which loads the heretic with anathemas, excommunicates the evil-doer, places nations under an interdict. It can scarcely be doubted that the current thoughts and language of Englishmen as to ecclesiastical discipline would have been very different, if instead of “tell it unto the church,” “if he neglect to hear the church,” we had had the word “congregation.” And yet this, or some such word (say “assembly” or “society”), is confessedly the true meaning of the Greek, and was the rendering of all the English versions, from Tyndale onwards, till the Rhemish translators introduced “church,” and were followed by the Authorised version.<p>So understood, the words point to the final measures for the reformation of the offender, and the vindication of the divine law of righteousness. When the two forms of private remonstrance have failed, the case is to be brought before the society at large. The appeal is to be made not to the rulers of the congregation, but to the congregation itself, and the public opinion of the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span> is to be brought to bear upon the offender. Should he defy that opinion and persist in his evil doing, he practically excommunicates himself. All societies are justified in excluding from their communion one who repudiates the very conditions of membership; and his being regarded as “a heathen and a publican” is but the legitimate consequence of his own act. Even here, however, we can hardly think of our Lord as holding up the Pharisees’ way of acting towards “the heathen and the publican” as a pattern for imitation. They were to be made to feel that they were no longer within the inner circle of brotherhood, but they were still men, and, as such, entitled to courtesy and all kindly offices. St. Paul’s teaching as to the treatment of the incestuous adulterer in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1-5</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6-7</a>, and of fornicators generally in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1Corinthians 6:1-7</a>, may be referred to as a practical illustration of the meaning of our Lord’s words.<p>It is obvious that the rule, as such, presupposes a small society, in the midst of a greater outside world, able to deal thus minutely with the offences of individual members. With the extension of the society, so that the church and the world became conterminous and hardly distinguishable, it was natural, perhaps, that it should follow the course of other human societies, and transfer its jurisdiction from the “congregation,” or “assembly,” to individual judges as its representatives. And so it was that, in the long-run, the bishops took the place of the congregation, and exercised its functions. So long as they were really in harmony with the mind of the church at large, this might work well enough, but there was the risk of their “lording it over God’s heritage” (<a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1Peter 5:3</a>); and, in any case, there was the loss of that activity of the reason and conscience of the society which the original form of polity implied, and of which St. Paul’s appeal to its judgment as against the inconsistency of the chief of the Apostles, is a very striking instance (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>). How far that can be revived is one of the hard questions of our own time and, perhaps, of all times. The end may have to be attained by very different means. We cannot inform the Universal or the National Church of the misdeeds of each individual member. Practically, to submit them formally to the judgments even of the smaller society of the town or village to which the offender belonged, would not be workable. Possibly, the solution of the problem may be found in remembering that in a Christian nation the Church and the State, as far as morality is concerned, tend, in spite of doctrinal divisions, to be, as was said, conterminous, and hence that we are fulfilling the spirit of our Lord’s commands when, after all private remonstrances have failed to check the evil, we appeal to the public opinion of Christians in the neighbourhood, larger and smaller, which is affected by it. How this is to be done will vary with the varying circumstances of each individual case, but it is no idle paradox to say that as society is now constituted, the most effective way of “telling the church” may sometimes be to appeal to that public opinion as represented by lawful courts, or otherwise impartially expressed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:15-20 If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tell it to the church - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. The church may here mean the whole assembly of believers, or it may mean those who are authorized to try such cases - the representatives of the church, or these who act for the church. In the Jewish synagogue there was a bench of elders before whom trials of this kind were brought. It was to be brought to the church in order that he might be admonished, entreated, and, if possible, reformed. This was, and is always to be, the first business in disciplining an offending brother.<p>But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be ... - The Jews gave the name "heathen" or "Gentile" to all other nations but themselves. With them they had no religious contact or communion.<p>Publican - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-47.htm">Matthew 5:47</a>. Publicans were people of abandoned character, and the Jews would have no contact with them. The meaning of this is, cease to have religious contact with him, or to acknowledge him as a Christian brother. It does not mean that we should cease to show kindness to him and aid him in affliction or trial, for that is required toward all people; but it means that we should disown him as a Christian brother, and treat him as we do other people not connected with the church. This should not be done until all these steps are taken. This is the only way of kindness. This is the only way to preserve peace and purity in the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother, &c.&#8212;Probably our Lord had reference still to the late dispute, Who should be the greatest? After the rebuke&#8212;so gentle and captivating, yet so dignified and divine&#8212;under which they would doubtless be smarting, perhaps each would be saying, It was not I that began it, it was not I that threw out unworthy and irritating insinuations against my brethren. Be it so, says our Lord; but as such things will often arise, I will direct you how to proceed. First, Neither harbor a grudge against your offending brother, nor break forth upon him in presence of the unbelieving; but take him aside, show him his fault, and if he own and make reparation for it, you have done more service to him than even justice to yourself. Next, If this fail, take two or three to witness how just your complaint is, and how brotherly your spirit in dealing with him. Again, If this fail, bring him before the Church or congregation to which both belong. Lastly, If even this fail, regard him as no longer a brother Christian, but as one "without"&#8212;as the Jews did Gentiles and publicans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 15-17. Our Saviour very appositely addeth this to his former discourse concerning avoiding offences, that none might think that by the former doctrine he had made void the law, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17</a></span>, which commanded all <span class="ital">in any wise to rebuke</span> their <span class="ital">neighbour, and not to</span> <span class="ital">suffer sin upon him, </span> pretending that it was their duty in some cases to offend any person by that law. He here telleth them that he would not be so understood, as if they might not tell offenders of their sins for fear of offending them, this had been to have withheld charity from their souls under a pretence of charity. Only in these reproofs we must keep an order, which order he here prescribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Doing it privately, between them and him alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. If that had not its effect, then taking two or three with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. If that also proved ineffectual, then telling it to the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. If that he would not <span class="bld">hear the church, then, let him be unto thee</span> (saith Christ) <span class="bld">as an heathen and a publican.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="ital">If thy brother shall trespass against thee.</span> By <span class="ital">brother</span> here he meaneth any Christian; for what hath the church to do to judge those that are without? <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within?">1 Corinthians 5:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Trespass against thee.</span> Some interpret this of offences done so privately, that none else knoweth them but one single person; but it is objected, that then there needed no going to him, much less were there need of any witnesses, for they could prove nothing. Others therefore understand the precept of private injuries, which are in man’s power to forgive, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/17-3.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves: If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.">Luke 17:3</a></span>. Others think such injuries are primarily intended, but yet the precept is not to be restrained to them, but to be understood of all offences, whether against God, ourselves, or our neighbours; and that our Saviour useth this term <span class="ital">against thee</span> only to distinguish the offences he is here speaking of from public scandals; for, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm" title="Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.">1 Timothy 5:20</a></span>, it appeareth to be the will of God, that public and open sinners should be rebuked <span class="ital">before</span> <span class="ital">all, that others may fear.</span> The rule therefore seemeth to be given concerning private miscarriages; not such only as are done in the sight or hearing of a single person, but such as are not the matter of public fame, nor openly committed before a multitude, but being committed more secretly, are come only to the knowledge of some particular person or persons. In such cases it is the will of God, not that we should blazon and publish them, but, being certain that any Christian hath so offended, it is our duty first to go to him, and tell him of it; that is, not only tell him what thou knowest, or hast heard in matter of fact, that he hath spoken or done, but show him also the sinfulness of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother; </span> that is, if he confesseth the sin, and be brought to a sight of it, a sorrow for it, and a resolution against it for the time to come, thou hast gained the soul of thy brother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But if he will not hear thee, </span> if he either denieth the matter of fact, that he did such a thing, or (admitting that) standeth to justify the fact, as what he might do, <span class="ital">then take with thee one or</span> <span class="ital">two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word</span> <span class="ital">may be established:</span> one or two more, either such as may be of more authority with him, whose words may probably be of more weight than thine with him, or who may witness the matter of fact if it be denied, or at least witness by charitable admonition of him, and his contumacy, if he refuseth to hearken to thee, and to repent and reform. What was the law of God in civil and judicial causes, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deu 19:15</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God would have observed in ecclesiastical causes: <span class="ital">One witness shall</span> <span class="ital">not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any</span> <span class="ital">sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth</span> <span class="ital">of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</span> And so the words in Matthew should be translated, or at least understood; <span class="ital">every</span> <span class="ital">word, </span> that is, every matter, be confirmed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And if he shall neglect to hear them; </span> either refuse to speak with them, or to suffer them to speak with him; or, hearing them with his ears, if he persists to deny the fact, or to justify the fact, as if it were no sin, or go on still in the same course; (all these things are to be understood by the term of not hearing); if he shall not hear them, <span class="ital">tell it to the church.</span> That the term church is a noun of multitude is evident, and therefore cannot be understood of any particular person. Some would by the church here understand the political magistrate; but as this sense is embraced by very few, so it is very improbable that our Saviour should send Christians in that age to the civil magistrates, when they were all great haters and persecutors of the Christian religion, especially in cases that were not punishable by the judges; for no deliberate person will say, that the offences mentioned in this text were all of that nature as a civil judicature might take notice of them. Others say, that by the church is here meant the Jewish court called the Sanhedrim, which had a mixed cognizance, both of civil and ecclesiastical causes. There are three prejudices against this: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the Jewish court was never in Scripture called ’ Ekklhsia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That it is not probable that our Saviour would direct Christians to go to the Jewish courts in such cases. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That the Sanhedrim was too great a court to be troubled with all scandals, though they did take cognizance of some things in religion, which were of a grand concern; such as blasphemy, idolatry, false prophets, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others therefore understand it of the Christian church. Against this opinion there is this great prejudice, that there was no such thing in being at that time; but I take this to be a lighter objection than those against the two other opinions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) Because we need not understand our Saviour speaking with relation to the present time, but the time to come, and giving laws which should take place and abide from the gathering of the Christian church to the end of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) Nor is it necessary that we should take the term <span class="ital">church</span> here in the strict sense, in which it is most generally used in the Scriptures of the New Testament for the general notion of the word is only a company of people called together; and in this sense, Tell the church, is no more than, Tell the multitude, make his crime more public: now what that multitude was which our Saviour meant, would easily be understood when the churches came to be formed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the next verse will make it more plain; <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/18-18.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 18:18</a></span>, <span class="ital">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be</span> <span class="ital">bound in heaven, &c.</span> By <span class="ital">the church</span> then must be meant those who had power to bind and loose. Now though at this time there was no particular church formed, yet there were some who had a power to bind and loose. Christ had given such a power to his apostles. These were the present church, and at this time in being. They were afterwards to constitute particular churches, to whom, (when constituted), in force of this precept, such offences were to be told. There are yet further disputes, whether this offence and contumacy be to be told only to the rulers, or to the multitude. I say, to the whole church, but first to the rulers, then by them to the multitude, not to judge of it, but for their consent in casting a person out of the communion of the church. Thus the incestuous person was first accused to Paul, then cast out by the consent of the whole church, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,...">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a></span>. For it is unreasonable to think that people should deny communion to any without knowing a justifiable cause; and to no purpose for rulers in a church to cast one out of its communion with whom the members will have communion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">If he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen</span> <span class="ital">man and a publican; </span> that is, esteem him as a vile person, for so they esteemed all heathens and publicans. How far this could reach beyond having an intimacy of civil communion with them, and a communion with them in the sacrament, I cannot understand; for as Christians were licensed to a civil commerce with heathens and publicans, so neither were heathens and publicans ever, that we read of in holy writ, denied the benefit of their prayers, and hearing the apostles preach. I am very well satisfied, that the primitive church did not deny to persons excommunicated liberty to be present at the prayers of the church, but it was long after the apostles’ times, and whether grounded upon any practice of theirs I much doubt. Christians had a liberty to pray for any who had not sinned the sin unto death: that they might not be present at such prayers I cannot learn from any thing in holy writ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if he shall neglect to hear them,.... The one or two, in conjunction with the offended person that shall hear the ease, and admonish and reprove; if he takes no notice of what they say to him, but remains stiff and impenitent, tell it unto the church: which some understand, of the  or "multitude", before whom it was lawful to reprove, after such private methods had been taken: others, the political magistrates, or sanhedrim; who took cognizance of cases between one person and other, either by themselves, or messengers; and gave admonitions and reproofs, as to parents, when they did not provide for their families (x), and to wives that were perverse, and provoked their husbands (y), &amp;c. others, of the presbyters and governors of the Christian church; others, of the church itself, and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "the house of Christians"; to which it is objected, that as yet a Christian church was not formed: but what were the twelve apostles of the Lamb? They were the great congregation and church, in the midst of which Christ sung praise to his Father: and since the whole of this advice, and these excellent rules are given to them, and they are spoken of in the next verse, as having the power of binding and loosing, they may well be thought to be meant here; and that the design of Christ is, to instruct them how to behave, in case of offence to one another; that the reproof should be first private, and if it did not succeed, to be made before one or two more; and if that did not do, the whole body was to be acquainted with it; and which rules hold good, and are to be observed by all Christian men and churches, in all ages: though no doubt but allusion is made to the Jewish customs, in rebuking before the multitude, or carrying of a private case, after all other means used were ineffectual, to the sanhedrim. <p>But if he neglect to hear the church: the advice they should give unto him, the reproof they should think proper for him, or the censure they should pass upon him, <p>let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican. This is not a form of excommunication to be used among Christians, nor was there ever any such form among the Jews; nor could Heathens or publicans, especially such publicans as were Gentiles, be excommunicated, when they never were of the Jewish church. <p>"A religious person indeed, that becomes a collector of taxes, they first said, is to be driven from the society; but they afterwards said, all the time that he is a tax gatherer, they drive him from the society; but when he goes out of his office, lo! he is as a religious person (z).'' <p>But one that never was of a religious society, could not be driven out of it. And besides, this is given, not as a rule to the church, but as advice to the offended person, how to behave towards the offender: after he has come under the cognizance, reproof, and censure of the church, he is to look upon him as the Jews did one that disregarded both private reproof by a man's self, and that which was in the presence of one or two more, , "a worthless friend", or neighbour; as a Gentile, with whom the Jews had neither religious nor civil conversation; and a "publican", or as Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads it,  "a notorious sinner", as a publican was accounted: hence such are often joined together, and with whom the Jews might not eat, nor keep any friendly and familiar acquaintance: and so such that have been privately admonished and publicly rebuked, without success, their company is to be shunned, and intimate friendship with them to be avoided. <p>(x) Maimon Hilehot Ishot, c. 12. sect. 14.

There is here no allusion to <span class="ital">individual congregations</span> in different localities, since these could come into existence only at a later period; neither, for this reason, can there be any allusion to <span class="ital">presbyters</span> and <span class="ital">bishops</span> (Chrysostom), or to those whom they may have invested, as their representatives, with spiritual jurisdiction (Catholic writers, comp. besides, Döllinger). There is, further, nothing to warrant the assumption of an historical <span class="ital">prolepsis</span> (de Wette, Julius Müller), for the truth is, the <span class="greekheb">קהל</span> of believers was actually existing; while, in the terms of this passage, there is no direct reference to individual congregations. But as Jesus had already spoken elsewhere of His <span class="greekheb">קהל</span> (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), it was impossible for the disciples to misunderstand the allusion. The warrant for regarding the judgment of the church as final in regard to the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> lies in the moral power which belongs to the unity of the Holy Spirit, and, consequently, to true understanding, faith, earnest effort, prayer, etc., the existence of all which in the church is presupposed. It is not inconsistent with this passage to suppose that, under the more developed circumstances of a later period, when local congregations sprung up as offshoots from the <span class="greekheb">קהל</span>, there may have been some representative body, composed of individuals chosen for the purpose of maintaining discipline, but the choice would necessarily be founded on such conditions and qualifications as were in keeping, so far as it was possible for man to judge, with the original principle of entrusting such matters only to those who were actual believers and had been truly regenerated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρακ</span>.] but if he refuses to listen even to the church; if he will not have submitted to its advice, exhortation, injunction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] let him be for thee (ethical dative); let him be in thy estimation as, etc.; <span class="greekheb">λοιπὸν ἀνίατα ὁ τοιοῦτος νοσεῖ</span>, Chrysostom. What is here indicated is the breaking off of all further Christian, brotherly fellowship with one who is hopelessly obdurate, “as not being a sheep, nor caring to be sought, but willing to go right to perdition,” Luther. In this passage Christ says nothing, as yet, about formal excommunication on the part of the church (1 Corinthians 5); but the latter was such a fair and necessary deduction from what he did say, as the apostolic church, in the course of its development, considered itself warranted in making. “Ad earn ex hoc etiam loco non absurde argumentum duci posse non negaverim,” Grotius. In answer to the latter, Calovius, in common with the majority of the older expositors, asserts that the institution of excommunication is, in the present passage, already expressly declared.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐθνικός</span>] generic.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν δὲ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">α</span>. Try first a minimum of social pressure and publicity, and if that fail have recourse to the maximum.—<span class="greekheb">εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>: speak to the “Church”—the brotherhood of believers in the Christ.

There is no reference in this passage to ecclesiastical discipline and Church censures. The older interpreters, in a theologico-polemical interest, were very anxious to find in it support for their developed ideas on these topics. The chief interest of historic exegesis is to divest it of an ecclesiastical aspect as much as possible, for only so can it suit the initial period, and be with any probability regarded as an utterance of Jesus. As such it may be accepted, when interpreted, as above. If, as we have tried to show, it was natural for Jesus to speak of a new community of faith at Caesarea, it was equally natural that He should return upon the idea in the Capernaum lesson on humility and kindred virtues, and refer to it as an instrument for promoting right feeling and conduct among professed disciples.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">tell it unto the church</span>] The word “church” (Grk. <span class="ital">ekklesia</span>) is found only here and ch. <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a> in the Gospels. In the former passage the reference to the Christian Church is undoubted. Here either (1) the assembly or congregation of the Jewish synagogue, or rather, (2) the ruling body of the synagogue (collegium presbyterorum, <span class="ital">Schleusner</span>) is meant. This must have been the sense of the word to those who were listening to Christ. But what was spoken of the Jewish Church was naturally soon applied to the Christian Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a heathen man and a publican</span>] Jesus, the friend of publicans and sinners, uses the phrase of His contemporaries.

The church is opposed to two or three in about the same proportion as two or three are to one. Amongst the Jews, ten men are considered to constitute <span class="greekheb">עדה</span>, a church,[825] or public assembly for the decision of private disputes. See Rhenferd Opera philologica,[826] p. 729; Buxtorf,[827] Synagoga Judaica, ch. 25, where the same things are prescribed to the offender which our Lord prescribes here to the injured party.—<span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">let him be</span>, etc.) Cf. <a href="/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a> <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm" title="And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; <a href="/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>; 2 John <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">to thee</span>) Although, perhaps, not to the witnesses and the church. Therefore no one should be considered as a stranger before he has been reproved, and disregarded the reproof.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐθνικὸς</span>, THE <span class="ital">heathen</span>) (sing.) We take this opportunity of making some observations on the Greek Article.[828] B. Stolberg rightly remarks, in his manuscript collection on the particles, that “there is scarcely an instance in the Scriptures where the article is redundant.” It is nowhere clearly useless: it is never added without an object, although philologists frequently attribute to it a wrong force and meaning. It is equivalent to the German der (<span class="ital">the</span>), and denotes less than <span class="ital">he (this)</span>, more than <span class="ital">quidam (some, a certain one</span>, or <span class="ital">thing</span>). It has, therefore, a determinating value; and it determines <span class="ital">either</span> (1) the universality and totality of the subject, as in <a href="/matthew/6-22.htm" title="The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.">Matthew 6:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ λύχνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., THE <span class="ital">light</span>, etc., q.d. the body has no light except the eye; <span class="ital">or</span> (2) the whole species, as in <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm" title="Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.">Matthew 15:11</a>, TO <span class="greekheb">εἰσερχόμενον</span>, <span class="ital">that which entereth</span>—TO <span class="greekheb">ἐκπορευόμενον</span>, <span class="ital">that which cometh out</span>—and in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ δίκαιος</span>, <span class="ital">but</span> THE <span class="ital">just, i.e.</span> he that is, or every one that is, just; or (3) the singularity and oneness [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the definite and exclusive individuality] of the subject, as in <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ἡ παρθένος</span>, THE <span class="ital">virgin</span>—in <a href="/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then?

In logic, however, universal and singular propositions are equivalent; whence (5) it has frequently a relative force, and that even in partition,[829] as in <a href="/luke/18-10.htm" title="Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.">Luke 18:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ εἷς φαρισαῖος καὶ Ὁ ἕτερος τελώνης</span>, THE <span class="ital">one a Pharisee and</span> THE <span class="ital">other a publican</span>—and in <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ εἷς ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἀλλος οὔπω ἠλθε</span>, THE <span class="ital">one is</span>, THE <span class="ital">other has not yet come</span>; or (6) it expresses a certain peculiar degree of a thing (rei exquisitam quandam rationem), as in <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm" title="But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 8:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ κλαυθμὸς</span>, THE[830] <span class="ital">weeping</span>, sc. weeping, compared with which earthly weeping is <span class="ital">not</span> weeping. It is, in fact, a subject which deserves to be more carefully examined by Philologists.[831] In this passage, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἐθνικὸς</span> signifies the whole race of Heathens, and any one thereto belonging. Thus, in the S. V. of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm" title="And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and spoiled ever more, and no man shall save you.">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, we have <span class="greekheb">Ὁ τυφλὸς</span>,, THE <span class="ital">blind</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ τελώνης</span>, <span class="ital">and the publican</span>) It was easy for the Jews to consider any one in the light of a heathen, therefore this clause is added to increase the force of the language; for the publicans dwelt amongst the Jews, but were shunned by them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[825] See <span class="ital">Bloomfield</span> and <span class="ital">Kitto</span> in loc., and <span class="ital">Trench’s New Testament Synonyms</span> in voc.—(I.

He devoted himself to the study of Hebrew and Chaldee literature, and became Professor of those languages at Basle. The great Scaliger declared that he was the only person who understood Hebrew thoroughly. The work cited by Bengel is, “<span class="ital">Synagoga Judaica, de Judaeorum fide, ritibus, ceremoniis, tam publicis et sacris quam privatis</span>;” a third and enlarged edition of which was published by his no less celebrated son, at Basle, in 1661.—(I. B.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[828] I have, in the disquisition which follows, inserted <span class="ital">in extenso</span> the passages referred to by Bengel. For a full consideration of this important subject, see that inestimably valuable work, <span class="ital">Middleton on the Greek Article</span>.—(I.

This is the third step to take. Our Lord is contemplating a visible society, possessed of certain powers of discipline and correction, such as we find in the history of the apostolic Church (see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 6:1, etc.; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>). Christ had already spoken of his Ecclesia in his commendation of Peter's great confession (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>); so the twelve were prepared for this use of the word, and would not confound the body here signified with the Jewish synagogue. To the latter the expressions in vers. 18-20 could not apply. The custom and order of procedure in the synagogue would afford an idea of what the Lord meant; but the congregation intended was to be composed of Christians. the followers of Christ, who were delivered from the narrowness of rabbinical rules and definitions. The institution of ecclesiastical tribunals has been referred to this passage, but, as understood by the apostles, it would denote, not so much ecclesiastical rulers as the particular congregation to which the delinquent belonged; and the offence for which he is denounced is some private scandal or quarrel. The course of proceeding enjoined would be impracticable in a large and widely extended community, and could not be applied under our present circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">If he neglect to hear the Church</span>. Now comes the final stage in corrective discipline. <span class="cmt_word">An heathen man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the Gentile</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and a publican</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the publican</span>). The class, not the individual, is meant. If he turns a deaf ear to the authoritative reproof of the Church, let him be regarded no longer as a brother, but as a heathen and an outcast. Christ, without endorsing the Jews' treatment of Gentiles and publicans, acknowledges the fact, and uses it as an illustration. The obdurate offender must be deprived of Church membership, and treated as those without the Jewish pale were commonly treated. The traditional law enjoined that a Hebrew might not associate, eat, or travel with a heathen, and that if any Jew took the office of <span class="accented">publicans</span>, he was to be virtually excommunicated. In later times, there naturally arose in the Christian Church the punishment of offenders by means of exclusion from holy communion, and excommunication. But even in this extreme case charity will not regard the sinner as hopelessly lost; it will seek his salvation by prayer and entreaty. </body></html>
