As there was no such limit to the forgiveness of God, so there should be none to that of man. The very question as to the latter showed the inquirer had not rightly apprehended the nature and extent of the former.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:21-35 Though we live wholly on mercy and forgiveness, we are backward to forgive the offences of our brethren. This parable shows how much provocation God has from his family on earth, and how untoward his servants are. There are three things in the parable: 1. The master's wonderful clemency. The debt of sin is so great, that we are not able to pay it. See here what every sin deserves; this is the wages of sin, to be sold as a slave. It is the folly of many who are under strong convictions of their sins, to fancy they can make God satisfaction for the wrong they have done him. 2. The servant's unreasonable severity toward his fellow-servant, notwithstanding his lord's clemency toward him. Not that we may make light of wronging our neighbour, for that is also a sin against God; but we should not aggravate our neighbour's wronging us, nor study revenge. Let our complaints, both of the wickedness of the wicked, and of the afflictions of the afflicted, be brought to God, and left with him. 3. The master reproved his servant's cruelty. The greatness of sin magnifies the riches of pardoning mercy; and the comfortable sense of pardoning mercy, does much to dispose our hearts to forgive our brethren. We are not to suppose that God actually forgives men, and afterwards reckons their guilt to them to condemn them; but this latter part of the parable shows the false conclusions many draw as to their sins being pardoned, though their after-conduct shows that they never entered into the spirit, or experienced the sanctifying grace of the gospel. We do not forgive our offending brother aright, if we do not forgive from the heart. Yet this is not enough; we must seek the welfare even of those who offend us. How justly will those be condemned, who, though they bear the Christian name, persist in unmerciful treatment of their brethren! The humbled sinner relies only on free, abounding mercy, through the ransom of the death of Christ. Let us seek more and more for the renewing grace of God, to teach us to forgive others as we hope for forgiveness from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Till seven times? - The Jews caught that a man was to forgive another three times, but not the fourth. Peter more than doubled this, and asked whether forgiveness was to be exercised to so great an extent.<p>I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven - The meaning is, that we are not to limit our forgiveness to any fixed number of times. See <a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>. As often as a brother injures us and asks forgiveness, we are to forgive him. It is, indeed, his duty to ask forgiveness, <a href="/luke/17-4.htm">Luke 17:4</a>. If he does this, it is our duty to declare that we forgive him, and to treat him accordingly. If he does not ask us to forgive him, yet we are not at liberty to follow him with revenge and malice, but are still to treat him kindly and to do him good, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

(See on [1326]Lu 17:3, 4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 21,22. Luke hath something like this <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/17-4.htm" title="And if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; you shall forgive him.">Luke 17:4</a></span>, but it seemeth to have been spoken at another time, and upon some other occasion; yet the sense is much the same, and there are who think that Peter’s mention of seven times arose from our Saviour’s command there, that we should forgive our brother offending us seven times, when our Saviour by it intended not a certain and definite number, but a number uncertain and indefinite. But it is a greater question, what sinning and what forgiveness is there meant, I cannot think that our Saviour here speaketh concerning the church’s absolving scandalous sinners justly excommunicated, but of the private forgiveness of injuries done to us; it is not the church, but I forgive him; for although the doors of the church ought to be as open to a repenting sinner as the doors of heaven are, yet I think both the phrase of the text and the following parable (which seemeth to me a comment upon this text) seem to lead us to the interpretation of these verses as to private wrongs or injuries; they are properly sins against us, and such as it is in every single person’s power to forgive. But it seems hard that Christians should be obliged to forgive another his private wrongs so often as he doth them, if he will go on without end multiplying affronts and injuries to us; we must therefore know, that our Saviour by this precept doth not oblige any to take his enemy into his bosom, and make him his intimate or confidant again; but only to lay aside all malice, all thoughts and desires of revenge towards him, to put on a charitable frame of spirit towards him, so as to be ready to do him any common offices of friendship. Thus far we are obliged to forgive those that do us injuries, so often as they stand in need of forgiveness. The apostle, <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a></span>, speaks of wrath, malice, &c., as pieces of the old man, which every true Christian hath put off, and calls upon us in malice to be children. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee,....

Christ's meaning is, that a man should be all the days, and every day of his life, forgiving those that sin against him, as often as they repent and acknowledge their fault; and that no time is to be set for the exercise of the grace of forgiveness; but as often as there are objects and occasions, though ever so many and frequent, it should be used; and which he illustrates by the following parable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/18.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/18-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I say not to you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.">Matthew 18:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ λέγω σοι</span>] are to be taken together (in answer to Fritzsche), and to be rendered thus: <span class="ital">I do not say to thee</span>, I do not give thee <span class="ital">the</span> prescription; comp. <a href="/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:">John 16:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑβδομηκοντάκις ἑπτά</span>] not: <span class="ital">till seventy times seven, i.e.</span> till the four hundred and ninetieth time (Jerome, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Grotius, de Wette, Bleek); but, seeing that we have <span class="greekheb">ἑπτά</span>, and not <span class="greekheb">ἑπτάκις</span> again, the rendering should simply be: <span class="ital">till seventy-seven times</span>.

This alone decides between the two renderings of <span class="greekheb">ἑβδομηκοντάκις ἑπτά</span>: seventy-seven times and seventy times seven, in favour of the latter as giving a number (490) practically equal to infinitude. Bengel leans to the former, taking the termination -<span class="greekheb">κις</span> as covering the whole number seventy-seven, and referring to <a href="/genesis/4-24.htm" title="If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.">Genesis 4:24</a> as the probable source of the expression. Similarly some of the Fathers (Orig., Aug.), De Wette and Meyer. The majority adopt the opposite view, among whom may be named Grotius and Fritzsche, who cite the Syriac version in support. On either view there is inexactness in the expression. Seventy times seven requires the termination -<span class="greekheb">κις</span> at both words. Seventy-seven times requires the -<span class="greekheb">κις</span> at the end of the second word rather than at end of first: either <span class="greekheb">ἑπτὰ καὶ ἑβδο</span> … <span class="greekheb">κις</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ἑβδομ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τα ἑπτάκις</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">Until seventy times seven</span>] i. e. an infinite number of times.

There is no measure to forgiveness; it must be practised whenever occasion arises. Some translate, "seventy-seven times," making an allusion to the retribution exacted from Lamech: "If Cain shall be  avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold" (<a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>). Christian forgiveness must be extended as far as old-world vengeance. Mercy rejoices against judgment. But the genius of the language supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. St. Paul has caught the spirit of his Master when he writes, "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). In the Mosaic dispensation there was some foreshadowing of the doctrine of forgiveness in the enactments which enjoined tender treatment of debtors, and in the terms of the jubilee law; but there were no rules concerning the pardon of personal injuries; the tendency of many prominent injunctions was to encourage retaliation. Herein is seen an important distinction between the Law and the gospel, the institutions antecedent to the death and atonement of Christ, and those subsequent thereto. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Seventy times seven (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;).<p>It was a settled rule of Rabbinism that forgiveness should not be extended more than three times. Even so, the practice was terribly different. The Talmud relates, without blame, the conduct of a rabbi who would not forgive a very small slight of his dignity, though asked by the offender for thirteen successive years, and that on the day of atonement; the reason being that the offended rabbi had learned by a dream that his offending brother would attain the highest dignity; whereupon he feigned himself irreconcilable, to force the other to migrate from Palestine to Babylon, where, unenvied by him, he might occupy the chief place (Edersheim). It must, therefore, have seemed to Peter a stretch of charity to extend forgiveness from three to seven times. Christ is not specifying a number of times greater than the limit of seven. He means that there is to be no limit. "Forgiveness is qualitative, not quantitative." </body></html>
