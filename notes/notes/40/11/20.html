It is observable, he had never upbraided them before. Indeed, at first they had received him with all gladness, Capernaum in particular. <span class="ital">Wo unto thee, Chorazin, </span>&c. — That is, miserable art thou. For these are not curses or imprecations, as has been commonly supposed; but a solemn, compassionate declaration of the misery they were bringing on themselves. Chorazin and Bethsaida were cities of Galilee, standing by the lake of Gennesareth, in which and the neighbouring places Jesus spent a great part of his public life. See notes on chap. <a href="/context/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:...">Matthew 4:13-16</a>. <span class="ital">If the mighty works </span>— The great miracles, <span class="ital">which were done in you, had been done </span>[of old] <span class="ital">in Tyre and Sidon </span>— Though cities inhabited by heathen, and remarkable for their luxury, pride, and contempt of religion, <span class="ital">they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes </span>— That is, they would have exercised the deepest repentance, for sackcloth and ashes were used by the Jews in token of the bitterest grief. <span class="ital">But I say unto you </span>— Besides this general denunciation of wo to those stubborn unbelievers, I declare particularly that the degree of their misery will be greater than even that of <span class="ital">Tyre </span>and <span class="ital">Sidon, </span>yea, of <span class="ital">Sodom. And thou, Capernaum, </span>&c. — He mentions Capernaum separately by itself, and last of all, because, being the place of his ordinary residence, it had been blessed with more of his sermons and miracles than any other town. Nevertheless it abounded with wickedness of all kinds, and therefore he compared it to that city which, on account of the greatness of its crimes, had been the most terrible example of the divine displeasure that ever the world had beheld. <span class="ital">It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, </span>&c. — That is, the condition of the inhabitants even of the land of Sodom, in the day of the final judgment, shall be more tolerable than thy condition. For thy condemnation shall rise in proportion to thy more aggravated guilt, and to those more valuable mercies and privileges which thou hast abused. Dr. Hammond understands this passage as referring to the temporal calamities to come on those places by the Romans; who did indeed shortly after overrun the whole country, and made dreadful ravages in some of those cities. But, as Doddridge justly observes, “There is no evidence that the destruction of those cities was more dreadful than that of Tyre and Sidon, and it was certainly less so than that of Sodom and Gomorrah: besides, our Lord plainly speaks of a judgment that was <span class="ital">yet </span>to come on all these places that he mentions.” From this passage, therefore, we learn “two important particulars: 1st, That the punishments to be inflicted upon wicked men in the life to come shall not be all equal, but in exact proportion to the demerit of the sins of each. 2d, That great and signal punishments, befalling sinners in this life, will not screen them from the wrath of God in the life to come; for Jesus Christ, the judge, here declares that Sodom, though burned by fire and brimstone from heaven, shall suffer such dreadful things, that, in speaking of the pains of the damned, he mentions this city as an example of very great punishment.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:16-24 Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who being out of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of their fellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for which they used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often very trifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge against every one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be a defence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews were more bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than those of Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation would be the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishes none more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of the truth from those who long after it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then began he to upbraid ... - That is, to reprove, to rebuke, to denounce heavy judgment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 11:20-30.

He now begins to reprove them smartly, not that they did not applaud and commend him, but because they did not repent. This was Christ’s end in all his preaching, and in all his miraculous operations, to bring men to repentance, and to receive him as the Messias; and this should be the great end pursued by all his ministers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then began he to upbraid the cities,.... When he had sent forth his disciples to preach, and had been in these several cities hereafter mentioned himself, and had taught and preached in them, and confirmed his doctrine by many wonderful works; when he had observed how ill they had used both John and himself, representing the one as having a devil, and the other as a licentious person; when they could not be pleased with the ministry of the one, nor of the other, he very seasonably and righteously began to reproach them with their ungenerous treatment of him, their ingratitude to him, their unbelief in him, the hardness and impenitence of their hearts; which could not be moved to repent of their evil ways, and believe in him, and acknowledge him as the Messiah, by all the instructions he gave them, and miracles he wrought among them: for the cities he has a view to, were such, <p>wherein most of his mighty works were done; the most for number, and the greatest in their kind; as particularly at Capernaum; where he cured the centurion's servant, recovered Peter's wife's mother from a fever, healed the man sick of a palsy, raised Jairus's daughter from the dead, made whole the woman that had a bloody issue, opened the eyes of two blind men, and cast out a devil from a dumb man, possessed with one: all these, and more, he did in this one city, and therefore he might justly upbraid them, <p>because they repented not: not because they did not commend him, and speak well of his works, for he sought not his own glory, but their good: all he did was, in order to bring men to repentance of their sins, and faith in himself, that they might be saved. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</span><p>(5) The proud reject the gospel offered to them (to their great hurt and pain) which leads to the salvation of the simple.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/11-20.htm" title="Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:">Matthew 11:20</a> ff. <span class="ital">Then He began</span>, and so on (<span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο</span>).
