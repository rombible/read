And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciple&#8212;rather, "the twelve disciples,"<p>he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities&#8212;This was scarcely a fourth circuit&#8212;if we may judge from the less formal way in which it was expressed&#8212;but, perhaps, a set of visits paid to certain places, either not reached at all before, or too rapidly passed through, in order to fill up the time till the return of the Twelve. As to their labors, nothing is said of them by our Evangelist. But Luke (Lu 9:6) says, "They departed, and went through, the towns," or "villages," "preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere." Mark (Mr 6:12, 13), as usual, is more explicit: "And they went out, and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many devils (demons) and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them." Though this "anointing with oil" was not mentioned in our Lord's instructions&#8212;at least in any of the records of them&#8212;we know it to have been practiced long after this in the apostolic Church (see Jas 5:14, and compare Mr 6:12, 13)&#8212;not medicinally, but as a sign of the healing virtue which was communicated by their hands, and a symbol of something still more precious. It was unction, indeed, but, as Bengel remarks, it was something very different from what Romanists call extreme unction. He adds, what is very probable, that they do not appear to have carried the oil about with them, but, as the Jews used oil as a medicine, to have employed it just as they found it with the sick, in their own higher way.<span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/11-2.htm" title="Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,...">Matthew 11:2-6</a></span> John sendeth his disciples to Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/11-7.htm" title="And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see?

Nor did our Saviour think it enough to send others in his stead, as his curates, he went himself. Luke notes, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a></span>, that he sent the seventy, two by two, into every city whither himself was to follow; so as it seems he did not judge it enough that one proclamation of the gospel should be made to them. For those that think there is a distinction to be made between preaching and teaching, khrussein and didaskein, they may learn from this text, that they are both the work of Christ’s ministers, if they be bound to take example from their Master, and not think the servant is above his Lord. Those that under value preaching, as the least part of the ministerial work, do both forget this text, and what Paul said, that Christ sent him not to baptize, but to preach the gospel; that is, not so much to baptize as to preach. If any think that people are now so instructed that there is no such need of preaching, they should do well to question their people a little, and they may discover their own great mistakes. Besides that experience teacheth us, that those who are best instructed are most desirous of that which deserveth the name of preaching; which lets us know that there is yet something further to be known, or that we had need have our remembrance stirred up, or at least our affections quickened. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass,....
