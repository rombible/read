Those who attend on the word will be called to give an account of their improvements. Do we think when the sermon is done, the care is over? No, then the greatest of the care begins. John was a self-denying man, dead to all the pomps of the world and the pleasures of sense. It becomes people, in all their appearances, to be consistent with their character and their situation. John was a great and good man, yet not perfect; therefore he came short of glorified saints. The least in heaven knows more, loves more, and does more in praising God, and receives more from him, than the greatest in this world. But by the kingdom of heaven here, is rather to be understood the kingdom of grace, the gospel dispensation in its power and purity. What reason we have to be thankful that our lot is cast in the days of the kingdom of heaven, under such advantages of light and love! Multitudes were wrought upon by the ministry of John, and became his disciples. And those strove for a place in this kingdom, that one would think had no right nor title to it, and so seemed to be intruders. It shows us what fervency and zeal are required of all. Self must be denied; the bent, the frame and temper of the mind must be altered. Those who will have an interest in the great salvation, will have it upon any terms, and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without a blessing. The things of God are of great and common concern. God requires no more from us than the right use of the faculties he has given us. People are ignorant, because they will not learn.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And from the days of John ... - That is, from the days when John began to preach. It is not known how long this was, but it was not probably more than a year. Our Saviour here simply states a fact. He says there was a great rush or a crowd pressing to hear John. Multitudes went out to hear him, as if they were about to take the kingdom of heaven by force. See <a href="/matthew/3-5.htm">Matthew 3:5</a>. So, he says, it has continued. Since "the kingdom of heaven," or "the gospel," has been preached, there has been a "rush" to it. People have been "earnest" about it; they have come "pressing" to obtain the blessing, as if they would take it by violence. There is allusion here to the manner in which cities were taken. Besiegers "pressed" upon them with violence and demolished the walls. With such "earnestness" and "violence," he says, people had pressed around him and John since they began to preach. There is no allusion here to the manner in which individual sinners seek salvation, but it is a simple record of the fact that multitudes had thronged around him and John to hear the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The hearts of men and women have been inflamed with a desire after the knowledge and obtaining of heaven, and heavenly things.

In this way is described that eager, irresistible striving and struggling after the approaching Messianic kingdom (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ μετὰ σπουδῆς προσιόντες</span>) which has prevailed since the Baptist began to preach; it is as though it were being <span class="ital">taken by storm</span>.

Finally, to take the verb in a <span class="ital">middle sense</span>, and as describing the <span class="ital">breaking in</span> of the kingdom which makes its way in spite of all resistance (Melanchthon, Bengel, Baur, Zyro in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

The statement just commented on had to be made in the interests of truth and the Kingdom of God, but having made it Jesus reverts with pleasure to a tone of eulogy. This verse has created much diversity of opinion, which it would take long to recount. I find in it two thoughts: one expressed, the other implied. (1) There has been a powerful movement since John’s time towards the Kingdom of God. (2) The movement derived its initial impetus from John. The latter thought is latent in <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ιωάν</span>. The movement dates from John; he has the credit of starting it. This thought is essential to the connection. It is the ultimate justification of the <span class="greekheb">περισσότερον</span> (<a href="/matthew/11-9.htm" title="But what went you out for to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.">Matthew 11:9</a>). The apostle Paul adduced as one argument for his apostleship, called in question by Judaists, <span class="ital">success</span>, which in his view was not an accident but God-given, and due to fitness for the work (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?...">2 Corinthians 3:1-18</a>). So Christ here in effect proves John’s fitness for the position of forerunner by the success of his ministry. He had actually made the kingdom come. That was the true basis of his title to the honourable appellation, “preparer of the way”; without that it had been an empty title, though based on any number of prophecies. That success proved fitness, adequate endowment with moral force, and power to impress and move men. This being seen to be Christ’s meaning, there is no room for doubt as to the <span class="ital">animus</span> of the words <span class="greekheb">βιάζεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">βιασταὶ</span>. They contain a favourable, benignant estimate of the movement going on not an unfavourable, as, among others, Weiss thinks, taking the words to point to a premature attempt to bring in the kingdom by a false way as a political creation (Weiss-Meyer). Of course there were many defects, obvious, glaring, in the movement, as there always are. Jesus knew them well, but He was not in the mood just then to remark on them, but rather, taking a broad, generous view, to point to the movement as a whole as convincing proof of John’s moral force and high prophetic endowment. The two words <span class="greekheb">βιαζ</span>., <span class="greekheb">βιασ</span>. signalise the vigour of the movement. The kingdom was being seized, captured by a storming party. The verb might be middle voice, and is so taken by Beng., “sese vi quasi obtrudit,” true to fact, but the passive is demanded by the noun following. The kingdom is forcefully taken (<span class="greekheb">βιαίως κρατεῖται</span>, Hesychius) by the <span class="greekheb">βιασταὶ</span>. There is probably a tacit reference to the kind of people who were storming the kingdom, from the point of view, not so much of Jesus, as of those who deemed themselves the rightful citizens of the kingdom. “Publicans and sinners” (<a href="/context/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.

St. Luke places (<a href="/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>) our vers. 12 and 13 in what appears to be merely a cento of sayings. Possibly the original occasion has been recorded by neither evangelist, but in Matthew the passage certainly brings out the thought upon which our Lord was insisting on this occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. Slightly adversative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>), for there is a change of subject. Christ urges his hearers to more definitely range themselves under his banner. <span class="cmt_word">From the days of John the Baptist until now</span>. Yet this was not more than a few months! Possibly the sentence had become modified in oral teaching, so as to include many years, say up to A.D.  or 60. St. Luke's <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is easy enough. Observe the implied success of John's work as herald. He so prepared the way that men were eager to enter the kingdom which  he had said was at hand. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven</span>. The realm ruled over by Messiah, of which the then community of believers was the earnest (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 25.). <span class="cmt_word">Suffereth violence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In Luke it is middle, "Every man entereth violently into it;" and though it is certainly passive here, St. Luke's phrase compels us to understand the reason of the violence to be entrance into the kingdom. The kingdom is not ill treated, but it is as it were taken by storm (Meyer). Nosgen strangely understands the phrase to mean that the kingdom is set forward with power, and he would apparently see in "the violent" a special reference to our Lord and John. <span class="cmt_word">And the violent</span>; <span class="accented">and men of violence</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>: only they; men whose mind is made up and who care not what force and power they employ to attain their object. <span class="cmt_word">Take it by force</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "grasp it for themselves," like rough and violent bandits seizing their prey. Weiss sees in this verse blame of the politico-Messianic endeavours to hasten the completion of the kingdom. This explanation is good in itself (cf. <a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>), but disconnects the verse from its context. Our Lord is describing the energy with which some souls are pressing in, and urging the need of such energy if salvation is to be obtained. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Suffereth violence (&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., is forced, overpowered, taken by storm. Christ thus graphically portrays the intense excitement which followed John's ministry; the eager waiting, striving, and struggling of the multitude for the promised king.<p>The violent take it by force (&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>This was proved by the multitudes who followed Christ and thronged the doors where he was, and would have taken him by force (the same word) and made him a king (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). The word take by force means literally to snatch away, carry off. It is often used in the classics of plundering. Meyer renders, Those who use violent efforts, drag it to themselves. So Tynd., They that make violence pull it unto them. Christ speaks of believers. They seize upon the kingdom and make it their own. The Rev., men of violence, is too strong, since it describes a class of habitually and characteristically violent men; whereas the violence in this case is the result of a special and exceptional impulse. The passage recalls the old Greek proverb quoted by Plato against the Sophists, who had corrupted the Athenian youth by promising the easy attainment of wisdom: Good things are hard. Dante has seized the idea:<p>"Regnum coelorum (the kingdom of heaven) suffereth violence<p>From fervent love, and from that living hope<p>That overcometh the divine volition;<p>Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man,<p>But conquers it because it will be conquered,<p>And conquered, conquers by benignity."<p>Parad., xx., 94-99. </body></html>
