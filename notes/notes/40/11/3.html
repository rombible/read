The question comes from him; the answer is sent to him. No difficulty in conceiving how the doubt which the question seems to imply could enter into the mind of the Baptist after the testimony which he had borne and that which he had heard, can warrant us in doing violence to what would seem to be the plain meaning of the history. And the meaning of the question is not far to seek. The sickness of deferred hope turns the full assurance of faith into something like despair. So of old Jeremiah had complained, in the bitterness of his spirit, that Jehovah had deceived him (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>). So now the Baptist, as week after week passed without the appearance of the kingdom as he expected it to appear, felt as if the King was deserting the forerunner and herald of His kingdom. The very wonders of which he heard made the feeling more grievous, for they seemed to give proof of the power, and to leave him to the conclusion that the will was wanting. And so he sends his disciples with the question, which is one of impatience rather than doubt, “Art Thou the coming One of whom the prophets spoke” (<a href="/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm" title="Blessed be he that comes in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.">Psalm 118:26</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>)? but if so, why tarry the wheels of Thy chariot? Are we still to look for another and a different Christ?”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-6 Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou he that should come? - That is, Art thou the Messiah, or the Christ?

The instance of this text alone is enough to convince the observing reader of holy writ, that the evangelists do not set down all things in that order as they were done. We have heard nothing before of John’s being cast into prison in this gospel, nor do we hear any thing here of the story of it, till <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/14-6.htm" title="But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.">Matthew 14:6</a></span>, when our evangelist occasionally relates it something largely. He here tells us of something done during his imprisonment, viz. his sending two of his disciples to Christ, to be satisfied whether he was the promised Messias, or they must look for another. Luke reports the same thing, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/7-19.htm" title="And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?">Luke 7:19</a></span>.

That they might be satisfied from their own sight of the works of Christ, he a little before his death sendeth them to Christ on this errand, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Art thou he who should come</span> (in the Greek, <span class="ital">who is coming)?</span> Which lets us know the full expectation the Jews generally had at that time of a Messias coming.

By the disciples he sent; this was the message they came with, and this the question they were to ask, and did, <p>art thou he that should come? A "periphrasis" of the Messiah, well known to the Jews; for he had been spoken of frequently in the prophecies of the Old Testament, as the Shiloh, the Redeemer, the Prophet, and King that should come; particularly, by this circumlocution, reference seems to be had to <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. "It shall surely come",  , which may be rendered, "for he that cometh", or "is to come, shall come". So that the question in plain terms is, whether he was the Messiah? John could not be ignorant of this, who had seen the Spirit of God descending on him at his baptism, heard a voice from heaven, declaring him the Son of God; and had so often pointed him out to others, and had borne frequent testimonies that he was the Lamb of God, and bridegroom of his church: wherefore this question was put, not upon his own account, but his disciples, that they might have from the mouth of Christ a full and satisfactory answer, which would remove all their doubts and scruples, and attach them to Christ, now he was about to die, and leave them, than which nothing was more desirable to him. Though some have thought, that John's faith was somewhat slackened; and through his long imprisonment, he began to doubt whether he was the Messiah or not: and others have been of opinion, as particularly Dr. Lightfoot, that the reason of this message was, neither the ignorance and unbelief of John, or his disciples; but that John, with the rest of the Jews, having a notion of a temporal kingdom, and hearing of the mighty works of Christ, wonders that he himself was not delivered out of prison by him, grows impatient upon it, and asks, if he was the Messiah? And if he was, why did he suffer his forerunner and chief minister to lie in prison? <p>or do we look for another, to release me, and set up this kingdom? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/11-3.htm" title="And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?">Matthew 11:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σύ</span>] Placed first for sake of emphasis.

It is a question whether Jesus be indeed the <span class="ital">Christ</span>. Lutteroth, basing on the hypothesis that for popular Jewish opinion the Christ and the coming One (a prophet like Moses) were different persons, interprets the question thus: “Art Thou, Jesus, whom I know to be the Christ, also the coming Prophet, or must we expect another to fill that rôle?”—<span class="greekheb">ἢ ἕτερον</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἄλλον</span>, which would have been more appropriate on Lutteroth’s view = a numerically distinct person. <span class="greekheb">ἕτ</span>. suggests a different kind of person.—<span class="greekheb">προσδοκῶμεν</span>: may be present indicative (for future) as Beza and Fritzsche take it, or present subjunctive deliberative = ought we to look? (Meyer-Weiss, Holtz., H.C.), the latter preferable. What was the <span class="ital">animus</span> or psychological genesis of the question? Doubt in John’s own mind, or doubt, bred of envy or jealousy, in the minds of his disciples, or not doubt on Baptist’s part, but rather incipient faith? Alternative (2), universal with the fathers (except Tertullian, vide <span class="ital">de prœscrip.</span>, 8, <span class="ital">de baptis.</span>, 10); (1) common among modern commentators; (3) favoured by Keim, Weizsäcker, and Holtz., H.C.: “beginnende Disposition zum Glauben an Jesu Messianität”. The view of the fathers is based on a sense of decorum and implicit reliance on the exact historical value of the statements in fourth Gospel; No. (3), the budding faith hypothesis, is based on too sceptical a view as to the historic value of even the Synoptical accounts of John’s early relations with Jesus; No. (1) has everything in its favour. The effect of confinement on John’s prophetic temper, the general tenor of this chapter which obviously aims at exhibiting the moral isolation of Jesus, above all the wide difference between the two men, all make for it. Jesus, it had now become evident, was a very different sort of Messiah from what the Baptist had predicted and desiderated (<span class="ital">vide</span> remarks on chap. <a href="/context/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire....">Matthew 3:11-15</a>). Where were the axe and fan and the holy wind and fire of judgment?

One of the designations of the Messiah; in every age the prophet said “He cometh.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is often disputed whether John sent this message (1) from a sense of hope deferred and despondency in his own soul; he would ask himself: (<span class="ital">a</span>) Is this the Christ whom I knew and whom I baptized? (<span class="ital">b</span>) Are these works of which I hear, the works of the promised Messiah? or (2) to confirm the faith of his disciples, or (3) to induce Jesus to make a public profession of His Messiahship. (1) The first motive is the most natural and the most instructive. In the weariness and misery of the prison the faith of the strongest fails for a moment. It is not doubt, but faith wavering: “Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.” (2) The second has been suggested and found support rather from the wish to uphold the consistency of the Baptist’s character than because it is the clearest inference from the text. (3) The third motive would have been hardly less derogatory to John’s faith than the first.

The question was brought from John; the answer is sent back to him (ver. 4). This points to the cause of the question lying ultimately, not with his disciples, but with himself. Although John might justly fear that they would follow him rather than Jesus (cf. <a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>, note), yet he seems to have made this inquiry for his own sake. He who stood on the Jewish side of the threshold of the kingdom (ver. 11) did not understand the methods by which the King was acting, and thus his faith was tried (comp. Tertullian, 'Adv. Marc.,' 4:18). In this he recalls his great prototype, whose plans seemed to have failed and his boldness to have done no good (<a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 14</a>).
