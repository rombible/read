At least one instance of each class of miracle has already been recorded by St. Matthew, the blind (<a href="/matthew/9-27.htm" title="And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.">Matthew 9:27</a>), the lame (<a href="/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>), the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>), the dead (<a href="/matthew/9-25.htm" title="But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.">Matthew 9:25</a>). The raising of the widow’s son at Nain, which in St. Luke follows closely upon the healing of the centurion’s servant, must also have preceded what is here narrated. What the Baptist needed was, not the knowledge of fresh facts, but a different way of looking at those he already knew. Where these works were done, there were tokens that the coming One had indeed come. But above all signs and wonders, there was another spiritual note of the kingdom, which our Lord reserves as the last and greatest: <span class= "ital">Poor men have the good news proclaimed to them.</span> They are invited to the kingdom, and told of peace and pardon. It is as though our Lord knew that the Baptist, whose heart was with the poor, would feel that One who thus united power and tenderness could be none other than the expected King.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-6 Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go and show John again ... - Jesus referred them for an answer to these miracles. They were proof that he was the Messiah. Prophets had indeed performed miracles, but no prophet had performed so many, or any so important. Jesus, moreover, performed them "in his own name" and by his own power. Prophets had done it by the power of God. Jesus, therefore, performed the works which none but the Messiah could do, and John might easily infer that he was the Christ.<p>The poor have the gospel preached to them - It was predicted of the Messiah that he would preach good tidings to the meek <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; or, as it is rendered in the New Testament, "He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor," <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>. By this, therefore, also, John might infer that he was truly the Messiah. It adds to the force of this testimony that the "poor" have always been overlooked by Pharisees and philosophers. No sect of philosophers had condescended to notice them before Christ, and no system of religion had attempted to instruct them before the Christian religion. In all other schemes the poor have been passed by as unworthy of notice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Our Lord here, has reference to several prophecies concerning the Messiah, in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a> and which having their accomplishment in him, John and his disciples might easily and strongly conclude, that he was he that was to come, and that they should not look for another. The several things here mentioned, were not all done at this time, but were what these disciples had sufficient and authentic evidence of; sight was restored to the blind before them then; and no doubt they were informed of the two blind men, that had their eyes opened, <a href="/matthew/9-30.htm">Matthew 9:30</a><p>and the lame walk; as did the man sick of the palsy, who was brought to him on a bed, carried by four men, but went away himself, with his bed upon his shoulders, <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a><p>the lepers are cleansed: as the poor man was, that was full of leprosy, and who was cured by Christ, by touching him, <a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a><p>and the deaf hear; as did the man, into whose ears Christ put his fingers and said, Ephphatha, be opened, <a href="/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a><p>and the dead are raised: as were Jairus's daughter, <a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a> and the widow's son of Nain, <a href="/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a><p>and the poor have the Gospel preached them; by "the poor" are meant, either the preachers of the Gospel; for so the words may be rendered, "the poor preach the Gospel": and such were the apostles of Christ; they were poor with respect to the things of this world; they were chiefly fishermen; and, with respect to human literature, they were unlearned men, had no stock or furniture of acquired learning, and were mean, abject, and contemptible, in the sight and opinion of men; and yet Christ called, qualified, and sent them forth to preach the Gospel. Or else, the hearers of it are designed; who were also the poor of this world, made a very low figure in life, and had but a small share of knowledge and understanding, and so were despised, and reckoned as cursed by the Scribes and Pharisees: or they were such, who were poor in spirit, or spiritually poor; who saw their spiritual poverty, bewailed and acknowledged it, and sought after the true riches of grace, and glory in Christ. Now these, as they had the Gospel preached to them more fully and clearly, with more power and authority, and so as it never was before or since, so they "received" it, as Tremellius from the Syriac reads the text, readily and willingly, joyfully and gladly, with faith and love; and were, as it may be also rendered, "evangelized" by it, or thrown into a gospel mould and frame: which may be said to be done, when a man has a spirit of liberty, in opposition to a spirit of bondage; when he lives by faith on Christ alone; when his comforts do not spring from his works, but from Christ; when the love and grace of God influence his repentance and obedience; when a man has a spirit of meekness and of love to the saints, is of a forbearing and forgiving spirit: when he is desirous of performing all duties both to God and man, and yet depends upon none of them, but upon Christ alone, for salvation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/matthew/11-5.htm" title="The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them....">Matthew 11:5-6</a>.

A reed shaken with the wind?">Matthew 11:7</a> ff., cannot be regarded as showing a want of spirituality, nor as inconsistent with the standpoint and character of one whom God had sent as the forerunner, and who had been favoured with a divine revelation, but only as a temporary eclipse of his settled conviction, which, owing to human infirmity, had yielded to the influence of despondency. This condition is so explicable psychologically from the popular nature of the form which he expected the Messianic kingdom to assume on the one hand, as well as from his imprisonment on the other, coupled with the absence of any interposition in his favour on the part of Him who, as Messiah in the Baptist’s sense, should have given things a totally different turn by manifesting Himself in some sudden, overwhelming, and glorious crisis, and so analogous to undoubted examples of the same thing in other holy men (Moses, Elias), that there is no foundation for the view that, because of this question of the Baptist (which Strauss even regards as an expression of the first <span class="ital">beginnings</span> of his faith), the evangelic accounts of his earlier relation to Jesus are to be regarded as overdrawn (on the other hand, Wieseler, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 203 ff.),—a view which seems to be shared by Weizsäcker, p. 320, and Schenkel. Actual doubt was the <span class="ital">cause</span> of the question, and furnished the <span class="ital">occasion</span> for informing him about the works of Jesus, which, as characteristic marks of the Messiah, formed again a counterpoise to his doubts, and so awoke an internal conflict in which the desire to call upon Jesus finally to declare Himself was extremely natural; and, accordingly, there is no reason for Strauss’ wonder that, ere this, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀκούσας</span> has not been substituted in <a href="/matthew/11-2.htm" title="Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,">Matthew 11:2</a> as a likely reading instead of <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσας</span>. From all this, and without importing any subjective element into the accounts, it is to be considered as settled that the Baptist’s question proceeded from real doubt as to whether Jesus was the <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενος</span>, yea or nay; nor is it for a moment to be limited (Paulus, Olshausen, Neander, Fleck, Kuhn, Ebrard, de Wette, Wieseler, Döllinger, and several others; comp. also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Weissag. u.

Werk</span>, I. p. 352) to doubts regarding <span class="ital">the true nature of the Messiah’s manifestation and works</span>; but still less is the whole narrative to be explained by supposing, in accordance with the time-honoured exegetical tradition, that John sent the message <span class="ital">for the benefit of his own disciples</span>, to confirm in <span class="ital">them</span> a belief in Jesus as the Messiah (Origen in Cramer’s <span class="ital">Catena</span>, Chrysostom, Augustine, Jerome, Hilary, Theophylact, Euth. Zigabenus, Münster, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Melanchthon, Clarius, Zeger, Jansen, Maldonatus, Grotius, Calovius, Bengel), or by seeing in it an expression of <span class="ital">impatience</span>, and <span class="ital">an indirect challenge to the Messiah to establish His kingdom without delay</span> (Lightfoot, Michaelis, Schuster in Eichhorn’s <span class="ital">Bibl</span>. XI. p. 1001 ff.; Leopold, <span class="ital">Joh. d. Täuf</span>. 1825, p. 96; Kuinoel, Fritzsche, Hase).

John was not wholly emancipated from the Jewish tendency to regard the external results of the kingdom; our Lord's mind dwelt rather on the internal results. Although John's difficulty had been felt when he heard of the works (ver. 2, note), our Lord only said in reply, "Tell him of my works." It was an old message, and yet a new one. In the nature of those works, when fully understood, lay the true solution of his difficulty.
