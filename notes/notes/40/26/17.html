Those who would have Christ's presence in the gospel passover, must do what he says. It well becomes the disciples of Christ always to be jealous over themselves, especially in trying times. We know not how strongly we may be tempted, nor how far God may leave us to ourselves, therefore we have reason not to be high-minded, but to fear. Heart-searching examination and fervent prayer are especially proper before the Lord's supper, that, as Christ our Passover is now sacrificed for us, we may keep this feast, renewing our repentance, our faith in his blood, and surrendering ourselves to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-7.htm">Luke 22:7-13</a>.<p><a href="/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a><p>The first day ... - The feast continued "eight" days, including the day on which the paschal lamb was killed and eaten, <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>.

There were seven of these days, and this was the first of them, in which the Jews might not eat leavened bread, from the fourteenth, to the twenty first of the month Nisan; in commemoration of their being thrust out of Egypt, in so much haste, that they had not time to leaven the dough, which was in their kneading troughs: wherefore, according to their canons (c), on the night of the fourteenth day; that is, as Bartenora explains it, the night, the day following of which is the fourteenth, they search for leaven in all private places and corners, to bring; it out, and burn it, or break it into small pieces, and scatter it in the wind, or throw it into the sea. Mark adds, "when they killed the passover", <a href="/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12</a>; and Luke says, "when the passover must be killed", <a href="/luke/22-7.htm">Luke 22:7</a>; which was to be done on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, after the middle of the day; and this was an indispensable duty, which all were obliged to: for so they say (d), <p>"every man, and every woman, are bound to observe this precept; and whoever makes void this commandment presumptuously, if he is not defiled, or afar off, lo! he is guilty of cutting off.'' <p>The time of killing the passover was after the middle of the day; and it is said (e) that <p>"if they killed it before the middle of the day it was not right; and they did not kill it till after the evening sacrifice, and after they had offered the evening incense; and after they had trimmed the lamps, they began to slay the passovers, or paschal lambs, unto the end of the day; and if they slayed after the middle of the day, before the evening sacrifice, it was right.'' <p>The reason of this was, because the lamb was to be slain between the two evenings; the first of which began at noon, as soon as ever the day declined: and this was not done privately, but in the temple; for thus it is (f) affirmed, <p>"they do not kill the passover but in the court, as the rest of the holy things.'' <p>The time and manner of killing the lamb, and by whom, of the sprinkling of the blood, and of their flaying it, and taking out the fat, and burning it on the altar, may be seen in the Misna (g). <p>The disciples came to Jesus; that is, Peter and John, as may be learnt from , for these only seem to have had any notion of Judas's betraying Christ, from what had been said at the supper in Bethany, two days before; the rest thought he was gone to prepare for the feast, and therefore were under no concern about it; but these two judged otherwise, and therefore came to Christ to know his mind concerning it; for it was high time that a preparation should be made; for this was Thursday morning, and the lamb was to be killed in the afternoon, and ate at even. <p>Saying unto him, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? This question in Luke follows upon an order which Christ gave to these disciples; "saying, go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat", <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>, for masters used to give their servants orders to get ready the passover for them; and which were expressed in much such language as this (h): <p>"he that says to his servant,    , "go and slay the passover for me": if he kills a kid, he may eat of it.'' <p>It is reported (i) of <p>"Rabban Gamaliel, that he said to his servant Tabi, , "go and roast" the passover for us upon an iron grate.'' <p>The disciples having received such an order from their master, inquire not in what town or city they must prepare the passover, for that was always ate in Jerusalem; see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5</a>, where they were obliged, by the Jewish canon (k), to lodge that night; though they might eat the unleavened bread, and keep the other days of the feast any where, and in every place (l); but they inquire in what house he would have it got ready; for they might make use of any house, and the furniture of it, where they could find room, and conveniency, without any charge; for they did not let out their houses, or any of their rooms, or beds, in Jerusalem; but, at festivals, the owners of them gave the use of them freely to all that came (m): and it is (n) observed among the wonders and miracles done at Jerusalem, that though there were such multitudes at their feasts, yet <p>"a man could never say to his friend, I have not found a fire to roast the passover lambs in Jerusalem, nor I have not found a bed to sleep on in Jerusalem, nor the place is too strait for me to lodge in, in Jerusalem.'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Now <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span><p>(6) Christ purposing to bring us into our country without delay and so, to pay the penalty of the law, truly fulfils the law, omitting the contrary tradition and custom of the Jews: and thus shows that all things will so come to pass by the ministry of men as governed by the secret plan of God.<p>(g) This was the fourteenth day of the first month: now the first day of unleavened bread should have been the fifteenth, but because the evening of this day (which after the manner of the Romans was referred to the day before) belonged by the Jews' manner to the day following, therefore it is called the first day of unleavened bread.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/26.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/26-17.htm" title="Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover?">Matthew 26:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῇ δὲ πρώτῃ τῶν ἀζύμ</span>.] <span class="ital">on the first day of the unleavened bread, i.e</span>. on the first day <span class="ital">of the feast</span>, the day <span class="ital">on which the unleavened bread</span> (<span class="greekheb">המצות</span>) is eaten.

Hebr. ratione, I. p. 12).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may seem strange that, at a season when the presence of such multitudes of strangers in the city was certain to create a scarcity of accommodation (Joseph. Bell. ii. 1. 3, vi. 9. 3; Antt. xvii. 9. 3), Jesus should have put off His arrangements for celebrating the feast till now. This, however, may be accounted for by the fact that He must have had certain friends in the town, such as the one referred to in <a href="/matthew/26-18.htm" title="And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.">Matthew 26:18</a>, whose houses were so much at His disposal at all times that it was unnecessary to make any earlier preparation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to John’s account, the last meal of which Jesus partook was not that of the Passover; while His death is represented as having taken place on the day before the feast, the day which Matthew here calls the <span class="greekheb">πρώτη τῶν ἀζύμων</span>.

The feast of unleavened bread followed the passover, and lasted seven days, from the 15th to the 21st of Nisan. Hence the two feasts are sometimes included in the term “passover,” sometimes in that of “unleavened bread.” On the evening of 13th of Nisan every head of the family carefully searched for and collected by the light of a candle all the leaven, which was kept and destroyed before midday on the 14th. The offering of the lamb took place on the 14th at the evening sacrifice, which on this day commenced at 1.30; or if the <span class="ital">preparation</span> fell on a Friday, at 12.30. The paschal meal was celebrated after sunset on the 14th, i. e. strictly on the 15th of Nisan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The events of the Passover are full of difficulty for the harmonist. It is however almost certain that the “Last Supper” was not the paschal meal, but was partaken of on the 14th, that is after sunset on the 13th of Nisan. It is quite certain, from <a href="/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>, that Jesus was crucified on the <span class="ital">preparation</span>, and although the synoptic narratives seem at first sight to disagree with this, it is probably only the want of a complete knowledge of the facts that creates the apparent discrepancy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The order of events in the “Passion” was as follows: when the 14th commenced, at sunset, Jesus sent two disciples to prepare the feast for that evening, instead of for the following evening. A sign of hastening on the meal may be detected in the words “my time is at hand,” <span class="ital"><a href="/matthew/26-18.htm" title="And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.">Matthew 26:18</a></span>, cp. <a href="/luke/22-15.htm" title="And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:">Luke 22:15</a>, “with desire I have desired to eat this passover with you <span class="ital">before I suffer</span>.” The supper follows, which bears a paschal character, and follows the paschal ceremonial. Early in the morning of the 14th of Nisan the irregular sitting of the Sanhedrin took place. Then followed the formal sitting of the Sanhedrin, and the trial before Pilate, the “remission” to Herod, and, finally, the Crucifixion. This view meets the typical requirements of our Lord’s death completely. During the very hours when our Great High Priest was offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins upon the cross, the Jewish people were engaged in slaying thousands of lambs in view of the paschal feast about to commence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">17–19</span>.

Moreover, we may reasonably infer that the <span class="ital">Jews</span> also, and not Jesus alone, <span class="ital">celebrated the paschal feast</span> on the evening of <span class="ital">Thursday</span>, from the fact—1) That otherwise the disciples would undoubtedly have been censured by the Jews at the close of the Friday, for omitting to keep the Passover, which they were not; and 2) Because, on the year on which Christ suffered, the conjunction of the Moon and Sun, before the Passover, fell on Wednesday, and therefore the new moon and Passover itself could not be thrust forward to <span class="ital">the Sabbath-day</span>. There is to be added, 3) the consideration that the supper, which is recorded even by John, ch. <a href="/context/matthew/13-1.htm" title="The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side....">Matthew 13:1-2</a>, was celebrated on Thursday, immediately before the feast of the Passover.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 501, 502.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On which they were bound to put away all leaven; and so the consumption of the paschal lamb could not be put off beyond 24 hours, to the evening of the Friday.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 490.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Preparation for the Paschal Sapper.</span> (<a href="/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a>; <a href="/luke/22-7.htm">Luke 22:7-13</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the first day of Unleavened Bread.</span> We have arrived at the Thursday in the Holy Week, Nisan 13. Wednesday had been spent in retirement at Bethany, and no acts or sayings of Christ on that day are recorded. The festival actually began at sunset of the 14th which was called the day of preparation, because the lambs for the feast were slain in the afternoon of that day, preparatory to their being eaten before the morning of the 15th. Domestic preparation, involving the removal of all leaven from houses and the use of unleavened bread, began on the 13th; hence this was considered at this era "the first day of the Unleavened." <span class="cmt_word">Came to Jesus.</span> As the Master of the family, who had the ordering of all the details of the Paschal celebration. They did not know the mind of Jesus on the subject, and desired his directions as in former years. Bethany was considered as Jerusalem for the purposes of the solemn meal, and the apostles thought that preparation was to be made at some house in that village. <span class="cmt_word">Prepare for thee to eat the Passover</span>. The preparations were numerous: a proper room had to be found and swept and carefully cleansed from every particle of leaven; tables and couches had to be arranged, lights to be supplied, the lamb and all other necessaries (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> bread, wine, bitter herbs) provided. All these preparations took much time, so it was doubtless in the early morning that the disciples applied to our Lord. When they spoke of eating the Passover, they doubtless supposed that Christ meant in due course to celebrate the regular Paschal supper on the appointed day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the evening of Friday. But his intentions were different from what they expected. </body></html>
