Our Saviour’s design here in general, is to inform his disciples of something which would happen by and by. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">All ye</span> (saith he) <span class="ital">shall be offended because of me this night.</span> The word <span class="ital">offended</span> is of a very large signification in holy writ; here it seems to signify disturbed or troubled, though if we take it strictly for stumbling, so as to sin, it was true enough, for that happened, (as we shall see anon), which made them to forsake Christ and flee, which doubtless was their sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock; shall be scattered abroad.</span> The words are <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones.">Zechariah 13:7</a></span>. The words there are imperative, <span class="ital">Smite the shepherd.</span> There are different opinions, whether that text is primarily to be understood of Christ, or it be only a proverbial speech, which the prophet made use of with another reference, which yet Christ doth apply unto himself. I do more incline to think, that Christ here interprets the prophecy to relate primarily to himself, for he doth not say, As it is said, but, It is written; yet, consider it as a proverbial speech, it is true of others also. But certainly our Saviour designed to uphold the spirits of his disciples, by letting them know, that though they should see the Shepherd smitten, that is, himself, who is the <span class="ital">good Shepherd, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a></span>; and is called by the apostle, <span class="ital">the great Shepherd of the sheep, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a></span>, <span class="ital">the chief Shepherd, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1 Peter 5:4</a></span>; yet they should not be disturbed, for: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It was no more than was prophesied concerning him, <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones.">Zechariah 13:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Though at present they were scattered, yet it should not be long, for he should rise again, and then he would go before them into Galilee; which was fulfilled, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/16-7.htm" title="But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see him, as he said to you.">Mark 16:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon these words, Peter, whom by all the gospel history we shall observe to have been of the highest courage, and most forward to speak, saith, <span class="ital">Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</span> These doubtless were his present thoughts, this his sudden resolution. Here now seem to come in our Saviour’s words to Peter, mentioned by Luke only, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31</a></span>, <span class="ital">Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">You</span> is in the plural number, and to be interpreted by <span class="ital">you all, </span> though our Saviour directeth his speech only to Peter, who first spake, whom he calleth by his own name, and doubles it, to signify his earnestness in giving him warning. To <span class="ital">sift you.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In sifting there are two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The shaking of the corn up and down. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The separation of the grain from the dust, or the seeds mixed with it: Satan hath desired, or hath obtained leave of my Father, to trouble you all, shaking your faith this and that way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But I have prayed, that although the workings of your faith be suspended, and the habit of your faith be shaken, yet it may not utterly fail, but the seeds of God may abide in you: you shall not wholly fall away, but be renewed again by repentance; and <span class="ital">when thou art converted, </span> when thou hast fallen, and shalt have a sight of thy error, and be humbled for it, endeavour to strengthen thy brethren’s faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may observe from hence: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That temptations are siftings. God sifts us to purge away our dross. Satan sifts us, if it were possible, to take away our wheat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the devil is the great tempter. Others may hold and move the sieve, but he is the master of the work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That he hath a continual desire to be sifting in God’s flour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That he hath a chain upon him; he must ask God’s leave to trouble his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That God often giveth him leave, but through Christ’s pleadings he shall not conquer: he may sift and trouble a believer, but the believer’s faith shall not fail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. That in the hour of temptation we stand in Christ’s strength, by the virtue of his intercession. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. That lapsed Christians, when the Lord hath restored them, ought to endeavour to strengthen and establish others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jesus saith to Peter, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> Luke saith, <span class="ital">thou shalt deny that thou knowest me.</span> Mark saith, <span class="ital">before the cock crow twice; </span> and so interprets Matthew, for he denied Christ but once before the cock did crow once. How little do we know ourselves, that cannot tell what our hearts will be three or four hours! Peter was too confident of the contrary, and replies again upon our Saviour, telling him, that if all should deny him, he would not. So also they all said, but what happened we shall hear more by and by. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Peter saith unto him,.... Mark says, "he spake the more vehemently", <a href="/mark/14-31.htm">Mark 14:31</a>; his spirits were raised to a greater pitch of resentment, and he expressed himself in stronger terms, and in more peremptory and self-confident language, <p>though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee: he seems to have understood Christ, that he should suffer death, and that he would be in great danger himself, and therefore rather than lose his life would deny his master; wherefore he most confidently affirms, that should this be the case, should he be called to suffer death for his sake, or along with him, he would most cheerfully embrace it, rather than be guilty of so dreadful a crime, which he could not look upon but with the utmost detestation and abhorrence, as to deny his dear Lord and Saviour: <p>likewise also said all the disciples; that they would never be offended because of him, and would die with him rather than deny him. This they said, being also self-confident and ignorant of their own weakness, and drawn into these expressions through Peter's example; and that partly to show their equal abhorrence of so horrible an iniquity, as denying Jesus; and partly to remove all suspicion from them, lest they should be thought to have less love and zeal for Christ than Peter had. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.
