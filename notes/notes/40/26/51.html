He came, it would seem, not as one of the officers of the Temple, but as the personal slave of Caiaphas. Three of the four Gospels use the diminutive form of the Greek for “ear,” St. Luke only (<a href="/luke/22-50.htm" title="And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.">Luke 22:50</a>) giving the primitive word. It is doubtful, however, whether the former was used with any special significance. St. Luke also (<a href="/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far.

God has no need of our services, much less of our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what.

It seems he had a sword by his side, upon what account is not certain; this he drew, and struck at a servant of the high priest's, who might show great malignity against Christ, and was foremost, and most busy in apprehending him. The blow was levelled at his head, and with an intention, no doubt, to have, cleaved him down, but sloping on one side took off his ear.

Of the circumstances which led to the subsequent miracle all the evangelists give an account; the miracle itself is related only by St. Luke. Conjecture has attempted to give reasons for these deficiencies in some of the narratives, and the complementary details in others; but it is wisest to say that thus it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost who guided the writers, and there to leave the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Drew his sword.</span> The apostles had evidently misunderstood the Lord's words uttered a little while before (<a href="/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36-38</a>), "He that hath no sword, let him sell his cloke, and  buy one." Two of them had then exhibited the weapons with which they had armed themselves, as if ready to repel violence And now one of these, thinking that the hour was arrived for striking a blow in his Master's defence, resorted to violence. Physical courage, indeed, Peter possessed, as was proved by his attitude in the face of fearful odds, but of moral courage he and his comrades exhibited little evidence, when, as soon as their Master was apprehended and led away, they "all forsook him, and fled" (ver. 56). <span class="cmt_word">Struck a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant of the high</span> <span class="cmt_word">priest's.</span> The man was the high priest's servant in a special way - what we should call his bodyservant; he had evidently made himself conspicuous in the arrest, and Peter struck fiercely at his head as the foremost of the aggressors. St. John, who was acquainted with the high priest and his household, gives his name as Malchus, a Syriac word, meaning "Counsellor." <span class="cmt_word">Smote off his ear.</span> The blow fell short, but inflicted a serious wound. How the mischief was repaired by the healing touch of Christ is mentioned alone by Luke the physician, for whom the incident would have special interest. We may note, in passing, that this miracle (the last which Christ worked before his death) was wholly unsolicited and unexpected on the part of the recipient, and was performed upon an enemy actually engaged in hostility. What more striking proof of the Lord's mercy and forgiveness could have been given? What better way could there be of demonstrating the nature of the kingdom which he came to establish? Thus he displayed his superhuman power even while surrendering himself to captivity and death. By this immediate action too he secured his followers from reprisal, so that they were allowed to retire unmolested, and Peter, though recognized to have been one of those in the garden (<a href="/john/18-26.htm">John 18:26</a>), was not punished for his part in the transaction. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The servant (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The article marks the special servant; the body-servant.<p>Ear (&#x3c9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>A diminutive in form but not in sense; according to a Greek popular usage which expressed parts of the body by diminutives; as &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, the nostrils; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the eye; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the body.
