If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what.

As soon as ever he appeared, before the rest could come up; for, he went before them, as Luke says, and that not only as, their guide to direct them to the person they wanted, but he separated himself from them, that it might not be thought that he came with them, or belonged to them: <p>and said, hail, master; and kissed him. Just as Joab asked Amasa of his health, and took him by the beard to kiss him, and smote him under the fifth rib, <a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>. The salutation he gave him was wishing him all health, prosperity, and happiness. The Syriac version renders it, "peace, Rabbi"; and the Persic, "peace be upon thee, Rabbi"; which was the very form of salutation the disciples of the wise men gave to their Rabbins, <p>"Says (n) Aba bar Hona, in the name of R. Jochanan, in what form is the salutation of a disciple to his master?  <p>, "peace be upon thee, Rabbi". <p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-45.htm">Mark 14:45</a>, the word "Rabbi" is repeated, this being usual in the salutation of the Jewish doctors; and the rather used by Judas under a pretence of doing him the greater honour, and of showing the highest respect, and strongest affection for him. So this deceitful wretch still addresses him as his master, though he was now serving his most implacable enemies; and wishes him all peace and joy, when he was going to deliver him into the hands of those that sought his life; and to cover all, kissed him, as a token of his friendship and the sincerity of it. It is rightly observed by Dr. Lightfoot, that it was usual for masters to kiss their disciples, particularly their heads; but then not for disciples to kiss their masters: of the former there are many instances in the Jewish writings, but not of the latter: yet, I can hardly think that this was done out of open contempt and derision; but under a pretence of respect and love; and even as being concerned for his present case, and as condoling him under the circumstances he was now likely to be in, through an armed hand, which was just upon him; and which he, by this artifice, would have suggested he had no concern with, <p>(n) T.

The signal, as arranged, was to be simply a <span class="ital">kiss</span>; the signal actually given was <span class="ital">kissing accompanied with embraces</span>, which was entirely in keeping with the excitement of Judas, and the desire he felt that there should be <span class="ital">no mistake</span> as to the person intended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/26-49.htm" title="And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.">Matthew 26:49</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατεφίλησεν</span>, kissed Him heartily.

What a tremendous contrast between the woman in Simon’s house (Luke 7) and Judas! Both kissed Jesus fervently: with strong emotion; yet the one could have died for Him, the other betrays Him to death.

Judas was more than usually demonstrative in his salutation. "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords" (<a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). So Joab treated Amasa before he murdered him (<a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9, 10</a>). What infinite patience for the Lord to submit to this hypocritical caress!
