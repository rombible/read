It was probably introduced into the later MSS. to bring the text into harmony with St. Luke’s report. Assuming the word “new” to have been actually spoken by our Lord, we can understand its being passed over by some reporters or transcribers whose attention had not been specially called to the great prophecy of <a href="/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. That prophecy was, however, certain to have a prominent place in the minds of those who had come into contact, as St. Luke must have done, with the line of thought indicated in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Matthew 8, 9), and therefore we cannot wonder that we find it in the report of the words given by him (<a href="/matthew/22-20.htm" title="And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription?">Matthew 22:20</a>) and by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1Corinthians 11:25</a>). If we were to accept the other alternative, it would still be true that the covenant of which our Lord spoke was <span class= "ital">ipso facto</span> new, and was therefore that of which Jeremiah had spoken, and that the insertion of the word (looking to the general freedom of the Gospels in reporting our Lord’s discourses) was a legitimate way of emphasising that fact.<p>Dealing with the words, we note (1) that the word “covenant” is everywhere (with, possibly, the one exception of <a href="/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16</a>, but see Note there) the best equivalent for the Greek word. The popular use of the “New Testament” for the collected writings of the apostolic age, makes its employment here and in the parallel passages singularly infelicitous. (2) That the “blood of the covenant” is obviously a reference to the history of <a href="/context/exodus/24-4.htm" title="And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.">Exodus 24:4-8</a>. The blood which the Son of Man was about to shed was to be to the true Israel of God what the blood which Moses had sprinkled on the people had been to the outward Israel. It was the true “blood of sprinkling” (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>), and Jesus was thus the “Mediator” of the New Covenant as Moses had been of the Old (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>). (3) That so far as this was, in fact or words, the sign of a new covenant, it turned the thoughts of the disciples to that of which Jeremiah had spoken. The essence of that covenant was to be the inward working of the divine law, which had before been brought before the conscience as an external standard of duty—(“I will put My law in their inward parts,” <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a>)—a truer knowledge of God, and through that knowledge the forgiveness of iniquity; and all this, they were told, was to be brought about through the sacrifice of the death of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Which is shed for many.</span>—The participle is, as before, in the present tense—<span class= "ital">which is being shed</span>—the immediate future being presented to them as if it were actually passing before their eyes. As in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, our Lord uses the indefinite “for many,” as equivalent to the universal “for all.” St, Paul’s language in <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a> shows, beyond the shadow of a doubt, how the words “for many” had been interpreted.<p><span class= "bld">For the remission of sins.</span>—This had been from the outset the substance of the gospel which our Lord had preached, both to the people collectively (<a href="/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-19</a>) and to individual souls (<a href="/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="/luke/7-48.htm" title="And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.">Luke 7:48</a>). What was new in the words now was this connection with the shedding of His blood as that which was instrumental in obtaining the forgiveness. Returning, with the thoughts thus brought together, to the command of <a href="/matthew/26-27.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;">Matthew 26:27</a>, “Drink ye all of it,” we may see, as before in the case of the bread, an allusive reference to the mysterious words of <a href="/context/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53-54</a>. In the contrast between the “sprinkling” of <a href="/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.">Exodus 24:6</a> and the “drinking” here enjoined, we may legitimately see a symbol, not only of the participation of believers in the life of Christ, as represented by the blood, but also of the difference between the outward character of the Old Covenant and the inward nature of the New. It is, perhaps, not altogether outside the range of associations thus suggested to note that to drink together of a cup filled with human blood had come to be regarded as a kind of sacrament of closest and perpetual union, and as such was chosen by evildoers—as in the case of Catiline (Sallust, <span class= "ital">Catil.</span> c. 22)—to bind their partners in guilt more closely to themselves. The cup which our Lord gave His disciples, though filled with wine, was to be to them the pledge of a union in holiness as deep and true as that which bound others in a league of evil.<p>We cannot pass, however, from these words without dwelling for a moment on their evidential aspect. For eighteen centuries—without, so far as we can trace, any interruption, even for a single week—the Christian Church, in all its manifold divisions, under every conceivable variety of form and ritual, has had its meetings to break bread and to drink wine, not as a social feast (from a very early date, if not from the beginning, the limited quantity of bread and wine must have excluded that idea), but as a commemorative act. It has referred its observance to the command thus recorded, and no other explanation has ever been suggested. But this being granted, we have in our Lord’s words, at the very time when He had spoken of the guilt of the Traitor and His own approaching death, the proof of a divine prescience. He knew that His true work was beginning and not ending; that He was giving a commandment that would last to the end of time; that He had obtained a greater honour than Moses, and was the Mediator of a better covenant (<a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:26-30 This ordinance of the Lord's supper is to us the passover supper, by which we commemorate a much greater deliverance than that of Israel out of Egypt. Take, eat; accept of Christ as he is offered to you; receive the atonement, approve of it, submit to his grace and his government. Meat looked upon, be the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish; it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ. This is my body; that is, spiritually, it signifies and represents his body. We partake of the sun, not by having the sun put into our hands, but the beams of it darted down upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of his grace, and the blessed fruits of the breaking of his body. The blood of Christ is signified and represented by the wine. He gave thanks, to teach us to look to God in every part of the ordinance. This cup he gave to the disciples with a command, Drink ye all of it. The pardon of sin is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's supper, conferred on all true believers; it is the foundation of all other blessings. He takes leave of such communion; and assures them of a happy meeting again at last; Until that day when I drink it new with you, may be understood of the joys and glories of the future state, which the saints shall partake with the Lord Jesus. That will be the kingdom of his Father; the wine of consolation will there be always new. While we look at the outward signs of Christ's body broken and his blood shed for the remission of our sins, let us recollect that the feast cost him as much as though he had literally given his flesh to be eaten and his blood for us to drink.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this is my blood - This "represents" my blood, as the bread does my body.<p>Luke and Paul vary the expression, adding what Matthew and Mark have omitted. "This cup is the new testament in my blood." By this cup he meant the wine in the cup, and not the cup itself. Pointing to it, probably, he said, "This - 'wine' - represents my blood about to be, shed." The phrase "new testament" should have been rendered "new covenant," referring to the "covenant or compact" that God was about to make with people through a Redeemer. The "old" covenant was that which was made with the Jews by the sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices. See <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; "And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with you," etc. In allusion to that, Jesus says, this cup is the new "covenant" in my blood; that is, which is "ratified, sealed, or sanctioned by my blood." In ancient times, covenants or contracts were ratified by slaying an animal; by the shedding of its blood, imprecating similar vengeance if either party failed in the compact. See the notes at <a href="/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16</a>. So Jesus says the covenant which God is about to form with people the new covenant, or the gospel economy is sealed or ratified with my blood.<p>Which is shed for many for the remission of sins - In order that sins may be remitted, or forgiven. That is, this is the appointed way by which God will pardon transgressions. That blood is efficacious for the pardon of sin:<p>1. Because it is "the life" of Jesus, the "blood" being used by the sacred writers as representing "life itself," or as containing the elements of life, <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>. It was forbidden, therefore, to eat blood, because it contained the life, or was the life, of the animal. When, therefore, Jesus says that his blood was shed for many, it is the same as saying that His life was given for many. See the notes at <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.<p>2. His life was given for sinners, or he died in the place of sinners as their substitute. By his death on the cross, the death or punishment due to them in hell may be removed and their souls be saved. He endured so much suffering, bore so much agony, that God was pleased to accept it in the place of the eternal torments of all the redeemed. The interests of justice, the honor and stability of his government, would be as secure in saving them in this manner as if the suffering were inflicted on them personally in hell. God, by giving his Son to die for sinners, has shown his infinite abhorrence of sin; since, according to his view, and therefore according to truth, nothing else would show its evil nature but the awful sufferings of his own Son. That he died "in the stead or place" of sinners is abundantly clear from the following passages of Scripture: <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>; <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 26:17-30.

It must not be supposed, however, that <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, which is used by Luke instead of <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, is essentially different from the latter; but is to be distinguished from it only in respect of the different moral basis on which the idea contained in it rests (like the German um and über), so that both the prepositions are often interchanged in cases where they have exactly one and the same reference, as in Demosthenes especially. See generally, on <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The shedding of the blood is the objective medium of the forgiveness of sins; the subjective medium, viz. faith, is contained by implication in the use made in this instance, as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a> (see on the passage), of <span class="greekheb">πολλῶν</span>, as well as in the symbolic reference of the <span class="greekheb">πίετε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is to be observed, further, that the genuineness of the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἄφες</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτ</span>. is put beyond all suspicion by the unexceptionable evidence in their favour (in opposition to David Schulz), although, from their being omitted in every other record of the institution of the supper (also in Justin, Ap. i. 66, c. Tr. 70), they should not be regarded as having been originally spoken by Christ, but as an explanatory addition introduced into the tradition, and put into the mouth of Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Jesus meant to institute a regular ordinance to be similarly observed by His church in all time coming, is not apparent certainly from the narrative in Matthew and Mark; but it is doubtless to be inferred from <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me....">1 Corinthians 11:24-26</a>, no less than from the practice of the apostolic church, that the apostles were convinced that such was the intention of our Lord, so much so, that to the words of the institution themselves was added that express injunction to repeat the observance <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν</span> which Paul and Luke have recorded. As bearing upon this matter, Paul’s declaration: <span class="greekheb">παρέλαβον ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου</span>, <a href="/matthew/26-23.htm" title="And he answered and said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.">Matthew 26:23</a>, is of such decisive importance that there can no longer be <span class="ital">any doubt</span> (Rückert, p. 124 ff.) as to whether Jesus intended to institute an ordinance for future observance. We cannot, therefore, endorse the view that the repetition of the observance was due to the impression made upon the minds of the grateful disciples by the first celebration of the supper (Paulus, comp. also Weisse, <span class="ital">Evangelienfr</span>. p. 195).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The two most recent and exhaustive Protestant monographs treating of the Lord’s supper on the lines of the Confessions, but also discussing the subject exegetically, are: Ebrard, <span class="ital">das Dogma vom heil. Abendm</span>., Frankf. 1845 f., as representing the <span class="ital">Reformed</span> view, and Kahnis, <span class="ital">d. Lehre vom Abendm</span>., Lpz. 1851, as representing the <span class="ital">Lutheran</span>. Rückert, on the other hand, <span class="ital">d. Abendm., s. Wesen u. s. Gesch</span>. (Lpz. 1856), ignores the Confessions altogether, and proceeds on purely exegetical principles. The result at which Ebrard arrives, p. 110 (comp. what he says, Olshausen’s <span class="ital">Leidensgesch</span>. 1862, p. 103), is as follows: “The <span class="ital">breaking</span> of the bread is a memorial of the death of Jesus; the <span class="ital">eating</span> of the bread thus broken is a symbolical act denoting that this death is appropriated by the believer through his fellowship with the life of Christ. But inasmuch as Jesus gives the bread to be eaten and the wine to be drunk, and inasmuch as He declares those substances to be pledges of the new covenant in His blood, the bread and the wine are, therefore, <span class="ital">not mere symbols</span>, but they assume that he who partakes of them is an actual <span class="ital">sharer</span> in the atonement brought about by the death of Christ. And since such a fellowship with Christ’s death cannot exist apart from fellowship with His life; since, in other words,” the new covenant “consists in an <span class="ital">actual connection and union</span>,—it follows that partaking of the Lord’s supper involves as its result a true, personal central union and fellowship of life with Christ.” The result at which Kahnis arrives in his above-cited work published in 1851[30] is the orthodox Lutheran view, and is as follows: “The body which Christ gives us to feed upon in the supper is the same that was broken for us on the cross,—just as its substratum, the bread, was broken,—with a view to its being eaten. The blood which Christ gives us to drink in the supper is the same that was shed for us on the cross,—just as its substratum, the wine, was poured out,—with a view to its being drunk” (p. 104). He comes back to Luther’s <span class="ital">synecdoche</span> in regard to <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, which latter he takes as representing the concrete union of two substances, the one of which, viz. the bread, constitutes the embodiment and medium of the other (the body); the former he understands to be, logically speaking, only <span class="ital">accidental</span> in its nature, the <span class="ital">essential</span> substance being brought out in the predicate. As for the second element, he considers that it expresses the identity of the communion blood with the blood of the atoning sacrifice, and that not in respect of the function, but of the thing itself (for he regards it as an arbitrary distinction to say that the former blood ratifies, and that the latter propitiates); and that, accordingly, the reality in point of efficacy which, in the words of the institution, is ascribed to the latter necessarily implies a corresponding efficacy in regard to the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By adopting the <span class="ital">kind</span> of exegesis that has been employed in establishing the strictly <span class="ital">Lutheran</span> view, it would not be difficult to make out a case in favour of that doctrine of <span class="ital">transubstantiation</span> and the <span class="ital">mass</span> which is still keenly but awkwardly maintained by Schegg, and which finds an abler but no less arbitrary and mistaken advocate in Döllinger (<span class="ital">Christenth. u. Kirche</span>, pp. 37 ff., 248 ff., ed. 2), because in both cases the results are based upon the application of the exegetical method to <span class="ital">dogmatic</span> premises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then, in the last place, Rückert arrives at the conclusion that, as far as Matthew and Mark are concerned, the whole stress is intended to be laid upon the <span class="ital">actions</span>, that these are to be understood <span class="ital">symbolically</span>, and that the <span class="ital">words</span> spoken serve only as hints to enable us to interpret the actions aright. He thinks that the idea of an actual eating of the body or drinking of the blood never crossed the mind either of Jesus or of the disciples; that it was Paul who, in speculating as to the meaning of the <span class="ital">material substances</span>, began to attach to them a higher importance, and to entertain the view that in the supper worthy and unworthy alike were partakers of the <span class="ital">body and blood of Christ</span> in the <span class="ital">supersensual</span> and <span class="ital">heavenly</span> form in which he conceived them to exist subsequent to the Lord’s ascension. In this way, according to Rückert, Paul entered upon a line of interpretation for which sufficient justification cannot be found either in what was done or in what was spoken by our Lord, so that his view has furnished the germs of a version of the matter which, so far at least as its beneficial results are concerned, does not tell in his favour (p. 242). In answer to Rückert in reference to Paul, see on <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] In his <span class="ital">Dogmatik</span>, however (1861), I. pp. 516, 616 ff., II. p. 657 ff., Kahnis candidly acknowledges the shortcomings of the Lutheran view, and the necessity of correcting them, and manifests, at the same time, a decided leaning in the direction of the Reformed doctrine. The supper, he says, “<span class="ital">is the medium, of imparting to the believing communicant, in bread and wine, the atoning efficacy of the body and blood of Christ that have been sacrificed for us, which atoning efficacy places him to whom it is imparted in mysterious fellowship with the body of Christ</span>.” Kahnis now rejects, in particular, the Lutheran <span class="ital">synecdoche</span> and approves of the symbolical interpretation in so far as bread and wine, being symbols of Christ’s body and blood, constitute, in virtue of the act of institution, that sacramental <span class="ital">word</span> concerning our Lord’s body and blood which when emitted by Christ has the effect of conveying the benefits of His death. He expresses himself more clearly in II. p. 557, where he says: “The Lord’s supper is the sacrament of the altar which, in the form of bread and wine, the symbols of the body and blood of Christ, which have been sacrificed for us, imparts to the believing communicant the sin-forgiving efficacy of Christ’s death.” Those divinely-appointed symbols he regards as the <span class="ital">visible</span> word concerning Christ’s body and blood, which word, as the terms of the institution indicate, is the medium through which the atoning power of His death, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. the forgiveness of sins, is communicated. From the bread and wine Christ is supposed to create a eucharistic corporeality, which He employs as the medium for the communication of Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As for the <span class="ital">different versions of the words of the institution</span> that are to be met with in the four evangelists, that of Mark is the most concise (Matthew’s coming next), and, considering the situation (for when the mind is full and deeply moved the words are few) and the connection of this evangelist with Peter, it is to be regarded as the most original. Yet the supplementary statements furnished by the others are serviceable in the way of exposition, for they let us see what view was taken of the nature of the Lord’s supper in the apostolic age, as is pre-eminently the case with regard to the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν</span> of Paul and Luke. Comp. on <a href="/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a>. According to Gess, I. p. 147, the variations in question are to be accounted for by supposing that, while the elements were circulating, Jesus Himself made use of a variety of expressions. But there can be no doubt that on an occasion of such painful emotion He would utter the few thoughtful words He made use of only <span class="ital">once for all</span>. This is the only view that can be said to be in keeping with the sad and sacred nature of the situation, especially as the texts do not lead us to suppose that there was any further speaking; comp., in particular, <a href="/context/mark/14-23.htm" title="And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it....">Mark 14:23-24</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ αἷμά μου</span>: the very colour of the wine suggestive; hence called <span class="greekheb">αἷμα σταφυλῆς</span> in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm" title="Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; my blood, pointing to the passion, like the breaking of the bread.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς διαθήκης</span> (for the two gen. <span class="greekheb">μου τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. dependent on <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span>, <span class="ital">vide</span> Winer, 30, 3, 3), the blood of me, of the <span class="ital">covenant</span>.

In short, the very words <span class="greekheb">ברית </span>and <span class="greekheb">ΔΙΑΘΉΚΗ</span> [by which the Old and New Dispensation are severally indicated] differ from each other, and their difference corresponds wonderfully with the actual state of the case. For the word <span class="greekheb">ברית </span>accords more with the Old economy, which had the form of a <span class="ital">covenant</span>, whereas <span class="greekheb">διαθήκη</span> accords more with the New economy, which has the form of a <span class="ital">testament</span>; on which account the Talmudists employ the Greek word <span class="greekheb">דייתיקי </span>[<span class="greekheb">ΔΙΑΘΉΚΗ</span>, written in Hebrew characters] as not having a Hebrew word whereby to express it. But the idea of a <span class="ital">covenant</span> does not so well agree with that entire son-ship which exists under the New Testament dispensation. Even the very notion of a <span class="ital">testament</span>, will at last, as it were, come to an end, on account of our intimate union with God: see <a href="/context/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me....">John 17:21-22</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ΠΟΛΛῶΝ</span>, <span class="ital">many</span>) even beyond the limits of Israel.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκχυνόμενον</span>, <span class="ital">which is being shed</span>) The present tense.

The evangelical covenant supersedes the Judaic, even as the sacrifice of Christ fulfils and supersedes the Levitical sacrifices. <span class="cmt_word">Which is shed</span> (<span class="accented">is being shed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for many</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">effundetur</span>, in reference to the crucifixion of the morrow; but this is tampering with the text. Rather, by using the present tense, the Lord signifies that his death is certain - that the sacrifice has already begun, that the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (<a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>) was now offering the eternal sacrifice. The whole ordinance is significant of the completion of the atonement. "Many" here is equivalent to "all." Redemption is universal, though all men do not accept the offer (see on ch. 20:28). Even Calvin says, "Non partem mundi tantum designat, sed totum humanum genus." <span class="cmt_word">For the remission of sins.</span> "For without shedding of blood is no remission" (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>); "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). The sacrifices of the Law, the blood of bulls and goats, could not take away sin; at most they gave a ritual and ceremonial purification. But what the Mosaic Law could not effect was accomplished by the precious blood of Christ, who offered himself a spotless and perfect Victim unto God. This is our Lord's most complete announcement of the propitiatory nature of his sacrifice, which is appropriated by faith in the reception of his precious blood. St. Paul adds, "This do ye (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me [<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, 'for my commemoration']." These were, of course, Christ's words spoken at the time, and are of most important bearing on what is called the sacrificial aspect of the Holy Eucharist. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Testament (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, to distribute; dispose of.
