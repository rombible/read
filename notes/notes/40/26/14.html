There was the shame, and therefore the anger, of detected guilt; there was the greed of gain that had been robbed of its expected spoil, and thirsted for compensation. The purpose that had been formed by the priests and scribes after the resurrection of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-47.htm" title="Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.">John 11:47</a>) may well have become known, and have suggested the hope of a reward. All these feelings were gathering strength through the three days that followed. Possibly there mingled with them a sense of disappointment that the kingly entry into Jerusalem was not followed up by immediate victory. St. Luke’s words, that “Satan entered into Judas” (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm" title="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.">Luke 22:3</a>), are remarkable (1) as implying the personal influence of the Tempter; (2) as indicating the fiendish tenacity with which he followed out his purpose; (3) as coinciding with what St. John (<a href="/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>) relates at a later stage of his guilt. Nor can we forget that, even at an earlier period of his discipleship, our Lord had used words which spoke of the “devil-nature” that was already working in his soul (<a href="/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/26-14.htm" title="Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,...">Matthew 26:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then one of the twelve </span>— Judas Iscariot, having been more forward than the rest (<a href="/john/12-4.htm" title="Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,">John 12:4</a>) in condemning the woman, thought himself, as it appears, peculiarly affronted by the rebuke which Jesus now gave to all his apostles. Rising up, therefore, he went straightway into the city to the high-priest’s palace, where doubtless he had received some previous information that the council would be assembled, and finding them there accordingly, <span class="ital">he said unto them, What will ye give me </span>— Words that show he was influenced to the infamous action partly, at least, by the love of filthy lucre; <span class="ital">and I will deliver him unto you? </span>— I will undertake to put him into your hands, at a time and place in which you may effectually secure him, without the danger of giving any alarm to the people. <span class="ital">And they covenanted </span>— Or, <span class="ital">bargained, with him for thirty pieces of silver </span>— That is, (reckoning each piece to be of the value of 2 Samuel 6<span class="ital"> d.</span>) for 3<span class="ital">l. </span>15<span class="ital">s. </span>sterling, the price of a slave, <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a>. <span class="ital">A goodly price that he was prized at of them! </span><a href="/zechariah/11-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them.

The greater profession men make of religion, the greater opportunity they have of doing mischief, if their hearts be not right with God. Observe, that Christ's own disciple, who knew so well his doctrine and manner of his life, and was false to him, could not charge him with any thing criminal, though it would have served to justify his treachery. What did Judas want? Was not he welcome wherever his Master was? Did he not fare as Christ fared? It is not the lack, but the love of money, that is the root of all evil. After he had made that wicked bargain, Judas had time to repent, and to revoke it; but when lesser acts of dishonesty have hardened the conscience men do without hesitation that which is more shameful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then one of the twelve ... - Luke says that Satan entered into Judas.<p>That is, Satan tempted (instigated) him to do it.

Accordingly, men were stationed around it, whose leaders or commanders were called "captains," <a href="/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a>. These men were commonly of the tribe of Levi, were closely connected with the priests, were men of influence, and Judas went to them, therefore, as well as to the priests, to offer his services in accomplishing what they so much desired to secure. Probably his object was to get as much money as possible, and he might therefore have attempted to make a bargain with several of them apart from each other.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>Mt 26:1-16.

Who was provoked and exasperated, to the last degree, by this action of the woman, and Christ's defence of it, and because the ointment was not sold, and the money put into his hand; and being instigated by Satan, who had now entered into him, formed a scheme in his mind to betray his master, and was resolved to put it in execution, whereby he might, in some measure, satisfy both his avarice and revenge; and, as an aggravation of this his wickedness, he is described, as "one of the twelve": of his twelve disciples; so the Persic and Ethiopic versions: this is a way of speaking used by the Jews (k); they call the twelve lesser prophets,  or  "the twelve", without any other word added thereunto. He was not an open enemy, nor one of Christ's common hearers, nor one of the seventy disciples, but one of his twelve apostles, whom he made his intimates and associates; whom he selected from all others, and called, qualified, and sent forth to preach his Gospel, and perform miracles: it was one of these that meditated the delivery of him into the hands of his enemies, and never left pursuing his scheme till he had effected it, even Judas Iscariot by name; so called, to distinguish him from another disciple, whose name was also Judas. This man <p>went to the chief priests; of his own accord, unasked, from Bethany, to Jerusalem, to Caiaphas's palace, where the chief priests, the implacable enemies of Christ, with the Scribes, and elders of the people, were met together, to consult his death: Mark adds, "to betray him unto them", <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-10.htm">Mark 14:10</a>, which was manifestly his intent in going to them; and Luke, that he "communed" with them "how he might betray him unto them", <a href="/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4</a>; in the safest, and most private manner; and both observe that they were glad; for nothing could have fallen out more to their wishes, who were met together on this design. The Jews, in their blasphemous account of Jesus (l), say as much: they own, that Judas, or Juda, as they call him, offered to betray him into the hands of the wise men, saying to them, almost in the words expressed in the following verse, <p>"if you will hearken unto me, , "I will deliver him into your hands tomorrow";'' <p>and which agrees very well with the time also: for it was two days before the passover that Jesus was in Bethany, where he supped with his disciples, and washed their feet, and had the box of ointment poured on his head; and on the night of the day after all this was done, Judas set out from thence to Jerusalem; see <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a>, so that it must be the next day before he could meet the high priests, and on the morrow, at night, he delivered him into their hands; on the proposal of which, they say, that Simeon ben Shetach, whom they make to be present at this time, and all the wise men and elders,   "rejoiced exceedingly". <p>(k) T.

Memor</span>. i. 2; Winer, Theile, Hase, Schollmeyer, <span class="ital">Jesus u. Judas</span>, 1836; Weisse, I. p. 450),—the traitor himself being now doubtful, according to Neander and Ewald, as to whether Jesus was the Messiah or not,—it may be affirmed that it has no foundation whatever in the Gospel record, although it may be excused as a well-meant effort to render a mysterious character somewhat more comprehensible, and to make so strange a choice on the part of Jesus a little less puzzling. According to John especially, the subjective motive which, in conjunction with Satanic agency (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm" title="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.">Luke 22:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>; <a href="/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him.

Naturally passionate at any rate (Pressensé), and destitute of clearness of head as well as force of character (in opposition to Weisse), he was now so carried away by his own dark and confused ideas, that though betraying Jesus he did not anticipate that he would be condemned to death (<a href="/matthew/27-3.htm" title="Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,">Matthew 27:3</a>), and only began to realize <span class="ital">what</span> he had done when the consequences of his act stared him in the face. Those, accordingly, go too far in combating the attempts that have been made to palliate the deed in question, who seek to trace it to <span class="ital">fierce anger against Jesus, and the profoundest wickedness</span> (Ebrard), and who represent Judas as having been from the first—even at the time he was chosen—the most consummate scoundrel to be found among men (Daub, <span class="ital">Judas Ischar</span>. 1816). That fundamental vice of Judas, <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>, became doubtless, in the abnormal development which his moral nature underwent through intercourse with Jesus, the power which completely darkened and overmastered his inner life, culminating at last in betrayal and suicide. Moreover, in considering the crime of Judas, Scripture requires us to keep in view the <span class="ital">divine teleology</span>, Peter already speaking of Jesus (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>) as <span class="greekheb">τῇ ὡρισμένη βουλῇ καὶ προγνώσει τοῦ θεοῦ ἔκδοτον</span>, in a way corresponding very much to the view taken of the conduct of Herod and Pilate in <a href="/acts/4-28.htm" title="For to do whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done.">Acts 4:28</a>. Judas is thus the tragic instrument and organ of the divine <span class="greekheb">εἱμαρμένη</span>, though not in such a sense as to extenuate in the least the enormity and culpability of his offence, <a href="/matthew/26-24.htm" title="The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.">Matthew 26:24</a>.

His worldly hopes fell altogether at the thought of “burial.” It is a striking juxtaposition: as Mary’s is the highest deed of loving and clear-sighted faith, Judas’ is the darkest act of treacherous and misguided hate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The motive that impelled Judas was probably not so much avarice as disappointed worldly ambition. Jesus said of him that he was a “devil” (<span class="ital">diabolus</span> or <span class="ital">Satan</span>), the term that was on a special occasion applied to St Peter, and for the same reason. Peter for a moment allowed the thought of the earthly kingdom to prevail; with Judas it was the predominant idea which gained a stronger and stronger hold on his mind until it forced out whatever element of good he once possessed. “When the manifestation of Christ ceased to be attractive it became <span class="ital">repulsive;</span> and more so every day” (Neander, <span class="ital">Life of Christ</span>, Bohn’s trans., p. 424).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/matthew/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/matthew/26-14.htm" title="Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,">Matthew 26:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πορευθεὶς</span>, <span class="ital">departing</span>[1118]) The disciples were not under restraint.

The time referred to is the close of Christ's addresses, and <span class="cmt_word">the</span> assembling of the Jewish authorities mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, vers. 6-13 being parenthetical. It is reasonable to suppose that the loss of the three hundred denarii, at which he would have had the handling, and the reproof then administered, gave the final impulse to the treachery of Judas. This seems to be signified by the synoptists' introduction of the transaction at Bethany immediately before the account of Judas's infamous bargain (see preliminary note on vers. 6-13). <span class="cmt_word">One of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot.</span> That he was one of the twelve, the chosen companions of Christ, emphasizes his crime, makes it more amazing and more heinous. To witness the daily life of Christ, to behold his miracles of mercy, to listen to his heavenly teaching, to hear his stern denunciations of such sins as covetousness and hypocrisy, and in spite of all to bargain with his bitterest enemies for his betrayal, reveals a depth of perverse wickedness which is simply appalling. Well may the evangelist say that Satan entered into Judas (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>); it was the devil's work he was doing; he followed this evil inspiration, and thought not whither it would lead him. <span class="cmt_word">Went unto the chief priests.</span> Their hostility was no secret. Judas and everybody knew of their hatred of Jesus, and of their attempts to get him into their power; he saw his way to  carrying out his purpose, and making of it some pecuniary gain. We are not to suppose that this miserable man sank all at once to this depth of iniquity. <span class="accented">Nemo repente fit turpissimus</span>. Though the descent to Avernus be easy, it is gradual; it has its steps and pauses, its allurements and checks. Modern criticism has endeavoured to minimize the crime of Judas, or even to regard him as a hero misunderstood; but the facts are entirely in favour of the traditional view. We can trace the path by which the apostle developed into the traitor, by studying the hints which the Gospels afford. He was probably at first fairly sincere in attaching himself to Christ's company. Being a man of business capacity and skill in the management of money matters, he was appointed treasurer of the little funds at the disposal of Christ and his followers. Half-hearted and self-seeking, his undertaking this office was a snare to which he easily fell a victim. He began by petty peculations, which were not discovered by his comrades (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), though he must often have felt an uneasy apprehension that his Master saw through him, and that many of his warnings were directed at him (see <a href="/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64, 70, 71</a>). This feeling lessened the love for Jesus, though it did not drive him to open apostasy. He had admitted the demon of covetousness to his breast, and he now adhered to Christ for the hope of satisfying greed and worldly ambition. The teaching and miracles of Christ had no marked influence on such a disposition, softened not his hard heart, effected no change in his evil and selfish desires. And when he saw his hopes disappointed, when he heard Christ's announcement of his speedy death, which his knowledge of the rulers' animosity rendered only too certain, his only feeling was hatred and disgust. The transient expectations raised by the triumphal entry were not fulfilled; there was no assumption of the earthly conqueror's part, there were no rewards for Christ's followers, nothing but enmity and threatening danger on every side. Judas, seeing all this, perceiving that no worldly advantage would be gained by fidelity to the losing side, determined to make what profit he could under present circumstances. Not with the mistaken idea of forcing Christ to declare himself, and to put himself at the head of a popular movement, nor with any notion of Christ miraculously saving himself from his enemies' hands, but simply from sordid love of gain, he made his infamous offer to the chief priests. It was just when they were in perplexity, and had determined on nothing except that the arrest and the condemnation were not to take place during the feast, that Judas was introduced into the assembly. No wonder "they were glad" (<a href="/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a>); here was a solution of the contemplated difficulty; they need have no fear of a rising in favour of Christ; if among his chosen followers some were disaffected, and one was ready to betray him, they might work their will, when he was once quietly apprehended, without any danger of rescue and disturbance (see on Matthew 27:3). </body></html>
