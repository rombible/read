It looks ill, and bodes worse, when those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent, and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then did they spit in his face - This, among the Jews, as among us, was significant of the highest contempt and insult, <a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>; <a href="/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>.<p>And buffeted him - That is, they struck him with their hands closed, or with the fist.<p>Others smote him with the palms of their hands - The word used in the original here means literally to strike with rods.

Euthy.

The p petrators of these outrages in Mk. are <span class="greekheb">τινὲς</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἱ ὑπηρέται</span>, the former word presumably pointing to some Sanhedrists. In Mt. the connection suggests Sanhedrists alone. Incredible that they should condescend to so unworthy proceedings, one is inclined to say. Yet it was night, there was intense dislike and they might feel they did God service by disgracing a pretender. Hence the invitation to the would-be christ to prophesy (<span class="greekheb">προφήτευσον</span>) who smote him when he was struck behind the back or blindfolded (<a href="/mark/14-65.htm" title="And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.">Mark 14:65</a>). Thus did they fill up the early hours of the morning on that miserable night. Sceptical critics, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Brandt, p. 69, also Holtz., H. C., suggest that the colouring of this passage is drawn from O. T. texts, such as Micah 4:14 (Sept[146] <a href="/matthew/5-1.htm" title="And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:">Matthew 5:1</a>, A. V[147]), <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm" title="I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.">Isaiah 50:6</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/53-3.htm" title="He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not....">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>, <a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm" title="But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?">1 Kings 22:24</a>, and that probably the texts created the “facts”.

When the meeting broke up, Jesus was for a time left to the brutal cruelty and the unbridled insolence of the guards and servants. Involuntarily, by their profanity and coarseness, they fulfilled the words of the prophet, speaking in the Person of Messiah, "I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting" (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did they spit in his face.</span> A monstrous indignity, so regarded by all people at all times (<a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>; <a href="/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Buffeted him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">struck him with fists. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Smote him with the palms of their hands</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).
