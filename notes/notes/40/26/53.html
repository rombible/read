If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> has the special meaning of "to summon with authority," "to call upon as an ally." Peter needed still to learn the lesson of Christ's Divinity, his oneness with the Father; and this is furnished by the right interpretation of this word, which was not, as our version seems to make it, the cry of an inferior to one mightier than himself, but the summons of an equal to his great Ally in heaven. So Jesus virtually says, "Have I not power through my own Godhead to summon my Father to support me?" (Sewell, 'Microscope of the New Testament'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall presently give me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The Authorized Version seems to have read <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> twice, "now...  presently." The manuscripts show it only once, but vary its position. It most probably belongs to the first clause. The verb rendered "give" has a more pregnant meaning. It is a military term meaning "to place by the side," "to post on one's flank." Hence the Lord implies that at a word the serried ranks of angels would range themselves at his side, true flank comrades, to defend and support him. <span class="cmt_word">Twelve legions of angels.</span> Not a dozen weak men. He employs the Roman term "legion" with intention. He had been arrested by a cohort (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3, 12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the tenth part of the legion, which numbered six thousand men; he could, it he chose, call to his aid twelve times six thousand angels, who would deliver their Lord from his enemies. If there was to be an appeal to force, which Peter's rash assault suggested, what could withstand his angelic allies, the heavenly hosts, infinitely more numerous, better disciplined, more effectively officered, prompt and happy to do the will of the great Commander?  <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Twelve legions of angels<p>Compare the story of Elisha at Dothan (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). </body></html>
