For neither can faith be separated from good works, nor can good works proceed except from faith. Christ’s meaning is only that we are called in order that we may be renewed in our minds after his image. And therefore, that we may remain always in his house, the old man, with his filthiness, must be put off, and a new life designed, that our attire may be such as is suitable to so honourable an invitation.” <span class="ital">And he was speechless </span>— Gr. <span class="greekheb">εφιμωθη</span>, <span class="ital">he was struck speechless. </span>“This is the true import of the original word, which is rendered very improperly in our translation, <span class="ital">he was speechless; </span>as from hence the English reader is led to conceive that the man was <span class="ital">dumb, </span>and so could not speak; whereas he was made dumb only by self-condemnation and conviction, even as Christ made dumb — <span class="greekheb">εφιμωσε</span>, — or <span class="ital">put to silence, </span>the Sadducees, <a href="/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34</a>; and as Peter would have us to <span class="ital">make speechless, </span>or <span class="ital">put to silence, </span>(<span class="greekheb">φιμουν</span>,) <span class="ital">the ignorance of foolish men.” </span>See Gerhard’s <span class="ital">Continuation. Then said the king to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, </span>&c. — Thus, 1st, Christ commands the ministers of his gospel, to whom the exercise of discipline in his church is committed, to exclude from the society of the faithful all who, by walking disorderly, bring a reproach upon the gospel, and to leave them to <span class="ital">outer darkness, </span>or the darkness without the pale of the church; that is, heathenish darkness. In other words, as is expressed <a href="/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>, <span class="ital">to let such be </span>unto them <span class="ital">as heathen and as publicans. </span>But, 2d, This clause of the sentence is to be chiefly referred to the last judgment, when Christ will command his angels to <span class="ital">gather out of his kingdom </span>not only <span class="ital">all things that offend, </span>but <span class="ital">them which do iniquity, </span>and to cast them into the <span class="ital">darkness </span>which is without the heavenly city, namely, into the <span class="ital">darkness </span>of hell, where there is <span class="ital">weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>The mention of <span class="ital">outer darkness </span>in the parable, in the connection in which it stands, “would incline one to think, either that the word <span class="greekheb">αριστον</span>, rendered <span class="ital">dinner, </span><a href="/matthew/22-4.htm" title="Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.">Matthew 22:4</a>, may signify <span class="ital">supper </span>as well as <span class="ital">dinner; </span>or that the king is represented as visiting the guests in the evening. But not to insist on this, which is of little moment, it is well known that banquets of this kind were generally celebrated in rooms richly adorned: and considering how splendid and magnificent the entertainments of the eastern princes were, it cannot be thought an unnatural circumstance, that such an affront as this, offered to the king, his son, his bride, and the rest of the company, should be punished with such bonds and thrown into a dungeon.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The provision made for perishing souls in the gospel, is represented by a royal feast made by a king, with eastern liberality, on the marriage of his son. Our merciful God has not only provided food, but a royal feast, for the perishing souls of his rebellious creatures. There is enough and to spare, of every thing that can add to our present comfort and everlasting happiness, in the salvation of his Son Jesus Christ. The guests first invited were the Jews. When the prophets of the Old Testament prevailed not, nor John the Baptist, nor Christ himself, who told them the kingdom of God was at hand, the apostles and ministers of the gospel were sent, after Christ's resurrection, to tell them it was come, and to persuade them to accept the offer. The reason why sinners come not to Christ and salvation by him, is, not because they cannot, but because they will not. Making light of Christ, and of the great salvation wrought out by him, is the damning sin of the world. They were careless. Multitudes perish for ever through mere carelessness, who show no direct aversion, but are careless as to their souls. Also the business and profit of worldly employments hinder many in closing with the Saviour. Both farmers and merchants must be diligent; but whatever we have of the world in our hands, our care must be to keep it out of our hearts, lest it come between us and Christ. The utter ruin coming upon the Jewish church and nation, is here represented. Persecution of Christ's faithful ministers fills up the measure of guilt of any people. The offer of Christ and salvation to the Gentiles was not expected; it was such a surprise as it would be to wayfaring men, to be invited to a royal wedding-feast. The design of the gospel is to gather souls to Christ; all the children of God scattered abroad, Joh 10:16; 11:52. The case of hypocrites is represented by the guest that had not on a wedding-garment. It concerns all to prepare for the scrutiny; and those, and those only, who put on the Lord Jesus, who have a Christian temper of mind, who live by faith in Christ, and to whom he is all in all, have the wedding-garment. The imputed righteousness of Christ, and the sanctification of the Spirit, are both alike necessary. No man has the wedding-garment by nature, or can form it for himself. The day is coming, when hypocrites will be called to account for all their presumptuous intruding into gospel ordinances, and usurpation of gospel privileges. Take him away. Those that walk unworthy of Christianity, forfeit all the happiness they presumptuously claimed. Our Saviour here passes out of the parable into that which it teaches. Hypocrites go by the light of the gospel itself down to utter darkness. Many are called to the wedding-feast, that is, to salvation, but few have the wedding-garment, the righteousness of Christ, the sanctification of the Spirit. Then let us examine ourselves whether we are in the faith, and seek to be approved by the King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Friend - Rather, "companions."

This assumes that the guests were supplied with robes by the king’s servants, which in the circumstances is intrinsically probable. All had to come in a hurry as they were, and some would have no suitable raiment, even had there been time to put it on. What the custom was is not very clear. The parable leaves this point in the background, and simply indicates that a suitable robe was necessary, however obtained. The king’s question probably means, how dared you come hither without, etc.?—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔχων</span>: <span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> this time, not <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/22-11.htm" title="And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:">Matthew 22:11</a>, implying blame.

Or, how couldst thou elude the vigilance of the servants, and enter in this unseemly garb? The former is doubtless the signification of the inquiry.

A different word for not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;) is used in the preceding verse, expressing an outward, objective fact which attracted the king's notice. The man had not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;) a wedding garment. When the king addresses the guest, he is thinking not so much of the outward token of disrespect, as of the guest's mental attitude toward the proprieties of the occasion. It is as if he had said, "What were you thinking of, where was your respect for me and for my guests, when you allowed yourself to come hither not (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;) having the proper garment, as you knew you ought to have?" It implies, as Dr. Morison observes, that the man was conscious of the omission when he entered, and was intentionally guilty of the neglect. This distinction between the two negative particles rests on the law of the Greek language, according to which &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; and its compounds stand where something is to be denied as a matter of fact, and &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; and its compounds when something is to be denied as a matter of thought.<p>He was speechless (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>Lit., he was muzzled or gagged.
