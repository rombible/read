He carried the great truths of the resurrection and a future state, further than they had yet been reveled. There is no arguing from the state of things in this world, as to what will take place hereafter. Let truth be set in a clear light, and it appears in full strength. Having thus silenced them, our Lord proceeded to show the truth of the doctrine of the resurrection from the books of Moses. God declared to Moses that he was the God of the patriarchs, who had died long before; this shows that they were then in a state of being, capable of enjoying his favour, and proves that the doctrine of the resurrection is clearly taught in the Old Testament as well as in the New. But this doctrine was kept for a more full revelation, after the resurrection of Christ, who was the first-fruits of them that slept. All errors arise from not knowing the Scriptures and the power of God. In this world death takes away one after another, and so ends all earthly hopes, joys, sorrows, and connexions. How wretched are those who look for nothing better beyond the grave!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As touching ... - That is, in proof that the dead are raised.<p>The passage which he quotes is recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, This was at the burning bush (Mark and Luke). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had been dead for a long time when Moses spoke this - Abraham for 329 years, Isaac for 224 years, and Jacob for 198 years - yet God spake then as being still "their God." They must, therefore, be still somewhere living, for God is not the God of the dead; that is, it is absurd to say that God rules over those who are "extinct or annihilated," but he is the God only of those who have an existence. Luke adds, "all live unto him." That is, all the righteous dead, all of whom he can be properly called their God, live unto his glory. This passage does not prove directly that the dead "body" would be raised, but only by consequence. It proves that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had an existence then, or that their souls were alive. This the Sadducees denied <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>, and this was the main point in dispute. If this was admitted - if there was a state of rewards and punishments - then it would easily follow that the bodies of the dead would be raised. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 22:15-40.

God doth not say I have been, but <span class="bld">I am:</span> he speaketh of the time present, when he spake to Moses, and of the time to come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. He doth not say, I am the Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but <span class="ital">the God of:</span> now wherever God styles himself the God of any people or person, it always signifieth, God as a Benefactor, and one that doth and will do good to such a people or person. It is a federal expression, as where he saith to Abraham, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/17-7.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you, and to your seed after you.">Genesis 17:7</a></span>, I will be a God to thee and thy seed, that is, of thee and of thy seed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, doth not signify part of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but their entire persons, which consist of bodies as well as souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. God is not the God of the dead, he doth not show kindness to them if they be dead, and shall rise no more. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. In this life, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob received no such signal kindness from God, but others might receive as great kindness as any of them did. Hence now our Lord proveth, as the immortality of their souls, so the resurrection also of their bodies, that God might show himself the God of whole Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Gerard saith: The argument of this text is made clear by <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a></span>, <span class="ital">Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.</span> This is that which made God to be truly called their God, because he hath prepared for them a city, which city they could never possess without a resurrection. It is yet further added by some, That God’s promise to Abraham of the land of Canaan was in these terms, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/13-15.htm" title="For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.">Genesis 13:15</a></span>, <span class="ital">To thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever; </span> not only to <span class="ital">thy seed, </span> but <span class="ital">to thee:</span> so to Isaac, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/26-3.htm" title="Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father;">Genesis 26:3</a></span>; to Jacob, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/35-12.htm" title="And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.">Genesis 35:12</a> <a href="/exodus/6-4.htm" title="And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.">Exodus 6:4</a>,8 Deu 11:21</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The promises seemed not to be fulfilled in giving their posterity the earthly Canaan, which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived not to enjoy; but to extend to the rest prepared for the people of God, the city mentioned by the apostle, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a></span>, which God had prepared for them, to justify himself to be their God. Now this could not be prepared for their souls merely, which were but a part of them, and hardly capable of perfect happiness without a reunion with the body, there being in it such an innate desire. Nor was it reasonable that the bodies of these saints, having been sharers with their souls in their labours, should have no share in their reward from that covenant; therefore of God with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our Saviour firmly proveth their resurrection. Luke addeth, <span class="ital">for all live unto him.</span> Not live unto him only as their end, but in the same sense as Paul saith of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">in that he liveth, he liveth unto God; </span> that is, with God. So saith Luke, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, though dead at present, live with God; and they, and all the children of Abraham, shall live to God, that is, with God, to all eternity. Matthew addeth, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</span> Poor people, they had been used to hear discourses from the Pharisees, about the traditions of the elders, rites and ceremonies, washing hands before meat, and the necessity of washing pots and cups; and the Sadducees, declaiming against the doctrines of angels and spirits, and the resurrection; they were astonished to hear one instructing them in things concerning their souls, the resurrection and life eternal, and confuting their great teachers from books of Scripture owned by themselves; for the Sadducees, though they had no great regard to the prophets, yet they owned and paid a great deference to the books of Moses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the multitude heard this,....

The Sadducees, thus answered in the presence of the listening crowds, attempted no reply, slunk away confounded, utterly foiled in their hope of casting ridicule on the teaching of Christ. St. Luke notes that some scribes present, doubtless of the Pharisaic faction, were highly delighted with this public defeat of their adversaries, and cried, in enforced admiration, "Master, thou hast well said!" </body></html>
