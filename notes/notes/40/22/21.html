It recognised the principle that the acceptance of the emperor’s coinage was an admission of his <span class= "ital">de facto</span> sovereignty. But the words that followed raised the discussion into a higher region, and asserted implicitly that that admission did not interfere with the true spiritual freedom of the people, or with their religious duties. They might still “render to God the things that were His”—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> (1), the tithes, tribute, offerings which belonged to the polity and worship that were the appointed witnesses of His sovereignty, and (2) the faith, love, and obedience which were due to Him from every Israelite. The principle which the words involved was obviously wider in its range than the particular occasion to which it was thus applied. In all questions of real or seeming collision between secular authority and spiritual freedom, the former claims obedience as a <span class= "ital">de facto</span> ordinance of God up to the limit where it encroaches on the rights of conscience, and prevents men from worshipping and serving Him. Loyal obedience in things in different on the part of the subject, a generous tolerance (such as the Roman empire at this time exercised towards the religion of Israel) on the part of the State, were the two correlative elements upon which social order and freedom depended. Questions might arise, as they have arisen in all ages of the Church, as to whether the limit has, or <span class= "ital">has</span> not, been transgressed in tins or that instance, and for these the principle does not, and in the nature of things could not, provide a direct answer. What it does prescribe is that all such questions should be approached in the temper which seeks to reconcile the two obligations, not in that which exaggerates and perpetuates their antagonism. Least of all does it sanction the identification of the claims of this or that form of ecclesiastical polity with the “things that are God’s.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:15-22 The Pharisees sent their disciples with the Herodians, a party among the Jews, who were for full subjection to the Roman emperor.

Jesus Christ was a faithful Teacher, and a bold reprover. Christ saw their wickedness. Whatever mask the hypocrite puts on, our Lord Jesus sees through it. Christ did not interpose as a judge in matters of this nature, for his kingdom is not of this world, but he enjoins peaceable subjection to the powers that be. His adversaries were reproved, and his disciples were taught that the Christian religion is no enemy to civil government.

Either Augustus Caesar's; for there was a coin of that emperor's, as Dr. Hammond reports, from Occo, which had his image or picture on it, and in it these words written, Augustus Caesar, such a year, "after the taking of Judaea"; which if this was the coin, was a standing testimony of the subjection of the Jews to the Romans; and this being current with them, was an acknowledgment of it by them, and carried in it an argument of their obligation to pay tribute to them; or it might be Tiberius Caesar's, the then reigning emperor, in the nineteenth year of whose reign, Christ was crucified; and seeing he had reigned so long, it is reasonable to suppose, his money was very common, and most in use: we read in the Talmud (s), of , "a Caesarean penny", or "Caesar's penny", the same sort with this: now this penny having Caesar's image and inscription on it, our Lord tacitly suggests, that they ought to pay tribute to him; since his money was allowed of as current among them, which was in effect owning him to be their king; and which perfectly agrees with a rule of their own, which runs thus (t): <p>"A king whose "coin" is "current" in any country, the inhabitants of that country agree about him, and it is their joint opinion,     "that he is their Lord, and they are his servants".'' <p>This being the case now with the Jews, Christ's advice is, <p>render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God, the things that are God's: give Caesar the tribute and custom, and fear, and honour, and obedience, which are due to him; which may be done without interfering with the honour of God, and prejudicing his interest and glory, when care is taken, that all the worship and obedience due to God are given to him: subjection to civil magistrates is not inconsistent with the reverence and fear of God; all are to have their dues rendered unto them, without entrenching upon one another. And the Jews themselves allow, that a king ought to have his dues, whether he be a king of Israel, or of the Gentiles: <p>"a publican, or tax gatherer, (they say (u),) that is appointed by the king, whether a king of Israel, or of the Gentiles, and takes what is fixed by the order of the government; it is forbidden to refuse payment of the tax to him, for  , "the right of a king is right".'' <p>Just and equitable, and he ought to have his right. <p>(s) T.

Then said he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.">Matthew 22:21</a> f. “There He catches them in their own trap,” Luther. The pointing to the image and inscription furnishes the questioners with ocular demonstration of the actual existence and practical recognition of Caesar’s sway, and from these Jesus infers not merely the lawfulness, but the <span class="ital">duty of paying to Caesar what belongs to Caesar</span> (namely, the money, which shows, by the stamp it bears, the legitimacy of the existing rule); but He also recognises at the same time the necessity of attending to their <span class="ital">theocratic</span> duties, which are not to be regarded as in any way compromised by their political circumstances: <span class="ital">and to God what is God’s</span> (what you derive from Him in virtue of <span class="ital">His</span> dominion over you). By this is not meant simply the <span class="ital">temple tribute</span>, nor the <span class="ital">repentance</span> which God may have desired to awaken through punishing them with a foreign rule (Ebrard), nor merely the life of the soul (Tertullian, Erasmus, Neander); but everything, in short, of a material, religious, and ethical nature, which God, as sovereign of the theocratic people, is entitled to exact from them as His due. By the <span class="greekheb">τὰ Καίσαρος</span>, on the other hand, we are not to understand merely the <span class="ital">civil tax</span>, but everything to which Caesar was entitled in virtue of his legitimate rule over the theocratic nation. So with this reply Jesus disposes of the ensnaring question, answering it immediately with decision and clearness, and with that admirable tact which is only met with where there is a moral insight into the whole domain of duty; in a quick and overpowering manner He disarmed His adversaries, and laid the foundation for the Christian doctrine which was more fully developed afterwards (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a> ff.; <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a> f.; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1 Peter 2:13</a> f., 17), that it is the duty of the Christian not to rebel against the existing rulers, but to <span class="ital">conjoin</span> obedience to their authority with obedience to God. At the same time, there cannot be a doubt that, although, in accordance with the question, Jesus chooses to direct His reply to the first and not to the second of those two departments of duty (in answer to Klostermann’s note on Mark), the second is to be regarded as the unconditional and absolute standard, not only for the first of the duties here mentioned (comp. <a href="/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a>), but for every other. Chrysostom observes that: what is rendered to Caesar must not be <span class="greekheb">τὴν εὐσέβειαν παραβλάπτοντα</span>, otherwise it is <span class="greekheb">οὐκέτι Καίσαρος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τοῦ διαβόλου φόρος καὶ τέλος</span>. Thus the second part of the precept serves to dispose of any collision among our duties which accidental circumstances might bring about (<a href="/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>). According to de Wette, Jesus, in the first part of His reply, does not refer the matter inquired about to the domain of conscience at all, but treats it as belonging only to the sphere of politics (<a href="/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>), and then adds in the second part: “You can and ought to serve God, in the first place, with your moral and religious dispositions, and should not mix up with His service what belongs to the domain of civil authority.” But such a severance of the two is not in accordance with the context; for the <span class="ital">answer</span> would in that case be an answer to an <span class="ital">alternative question</span> based on the general thought: is it lawful to be subject to Caesar, or to God only? Whereas the reply of Jesus is: you ought to do <span class="ital">both things</span>, you ought to be subject to God <span class="ital">and</span> to Caesar as well; the one duty is <span class="ital">inseparable</span> from the other! Thus our Lord <span class="ital">rises</span> above the <span class="ital">alternative</span>, which was based on theocratic notions of a one-sided and degenerate character, to the higher <span class="ital">unity of the true theocracy</span>, which demands no revolutions of any kind, and also looks upon the right moral conception of the existing civil rule as necessarily part and parcel of itself (<a href="/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>), and consequently a simple yes or no in reply to the question under consideration is quite impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπόδοτε</span>] the ordinary expression for <span class="ital">paying what it is one’s duty to pay</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/20-8.htm" title="So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.">Matthew 20:8</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-41.htm" title="They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other farmers, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.">Matthew 21:41</a>; <a href="/romans/13-7.htm" title="Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.">Romans 13:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/matthew/22-22.htm" title="When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and went their way.">Matthew 22:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθαύμασαν</span>] “conspicuo modo ob responsum tutum et verum,” Bengel. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν δέ</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/matthew/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/matthew/22-21.htm" title="They say to him, Caesar's.

The image and inscription showed that <span class="ital">giving</span> (<a href="/matthew/22-17.htm" title="Tell us therefore, What think you? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?">Matthew 22:17</a>) tribute to Caesar was only giving <span class="ital">back</span> to him his own. This was an unanswerable <span class="ital">argumentum ad hominem</span> as addressed to men who had no scruple about using Caesar’s coin for ordinary purposes, but of course it did not settle the question. The previous question might be raised, Had Caesar a right to coin money for Palestine, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to rule over it? The coin showed that he was ruler <span class="ital">de facto</span>, but not necessarily <span class="ital">de jure</span>, unless on the doctrine that might is right. The really important point in Christ’s answer is, not what is said but what is implied, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that national independence is not an ultimate <span class="ital">good</span>, nor the patriotism that fights for it an ultimate <span class="ital">virtue</span>. This doctrine Jesus held in common with the prophets. He virtually asserted it by distinguishing between the things of Caesar and the things of God. To have treated these as one, the latter category absorbing the former, would have been to say: The kingdom of God means the kingdom restored to Israel. By treating them as distinct Jesus said in effect: The kingdom of God is not of this world, it is possible to be a true citizen of the kingdom and yet quietly submit to the civil rule of a foreign potentate. This is the permanent didactic significance of the shrewd reply, safe and true (<span class="ital">tutum et verum</span>, Bengel), by which Jesus outwitted His crafty foes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar’s</span>] The Jewish doctors laid down the principle that “He is king whose coin passes current.” St Paul expands this principle, which underlies our Lord’s answer (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a> foll.

As the subjects and “husbandmen” of God, the Jews owe Him service and fruit.

Jesus saith, It is right, according to divine law, that <span class="ital">both</span> be done. So also the Sadducees were thinking thus: If the resurrection be admitted, the wife must be given back <span class="ital">either</span> to the first brother, <span class="ital">or</span> to the second, etc. But Truth subjoins the reply, She is to be given back <span class="ital">not even to any one</span> out of them all.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Caesar's</span>.

Rabbinism ruled that the right of coinage appertained to the ruler of a state, and was a proof of <span class="accented">de facto</span> government, which it was unlawful to resist. The current coin, which they used in their daily transactions, showed that the Jews were no longer independent, but set under and acquiescing in a foreign domination. Being subjects of Caesar, it was their duty to submit to his demands, and to pay the taxes which he had a right to levy. This was an answer to the insidious question propounded. Christ does not take either side in the controversy; he makes no question of the mutual rights of conquered and conquerors; he utters no aspiration for the recovery of independence; he uses facts as they are, and points to habitual practice as a sufficient solution of the difficulty. No reply could be wiser or simpler. Herein he gives a lesson for all time. No plea of religion can hold good against obedience to lawful authority. "Render to all their dues," says St. Paul (<a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>): "tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour." <span class="cmt_word">The things that</span> <span class="cmt_word">are God's;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The things of God arc ourselves - our life, powers, faculties, means; to use these in God's service is our duty and our privilege. There need be no conflict between religion and politics, Church and state. Let a citizen do his duty to God, and he will find his obligations to the civil power are coincident and harmonious. Let the state respect the rights of God and of conscience, and there will he no collision between itself and the Church, but both will peaceably cooperate for the good of the community. Had the Jews rendered to God his dues, they would never have been reduced to their present state of subjection and debasement; would never have had to pay tribute to a foreign nation. </body></html>
