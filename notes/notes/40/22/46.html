How he could be the Son of David and yet his Lord? He quotes Ps 110:1. If the Christ was to be a mere man, who would not exist till many ages after David's death, how could his forefather call him Lord? The Pharisees could not answer it. Nor can any solve the difficulty except he allows the Messiah to be the Son of God, and David's Lord equally with the Father. He took upon him human nature, and so became God manifested in the flesh; in this sense he is the Son of man and the Son of David. It behoves us above all things seriously to inquire, What think we of Christ? Is he altogether glorious in our eyes, and precious to our hearts? May Christ be our joy, our confidence, our all. May we daily be made more like to him, and more devoted to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If David ... - If he was then David's lord if he was his superior - if he had an existence at that time how could he be descended from him? They could not answer him.<p>Nor is there any way of answering the question but by the admission that the Messiah was divine as well as human; that he had an existence at the time of David, and was his lord and master, his God I and king, and that as man he was descended from him.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a><p>1. Multitudes of people, who are invited to be saved, reject the gospel and perish in their sins, <a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a>.<p>2. If they perish, they only will be to blame. The offer was freely made, the salvation was provided, and the only reason why they were not saved was that they would not come, <a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a>.<p>3. Attention to the affairs of this life, the love of the world, will shut many out of the kingdom of heaven, <a href="/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a>. Some attention to those things is necessary; but such a devotion to these things as to lead to the loss of the soul never can be right.<p>4. It is treating God ungratefully to reject his gospel, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3-5</a>. He has sent his Son to die for us; he has entreated us to be saved; he has followed us with mercies; and to reject all these, and refuse to be saved, is to treat him with contempt, as well as to overwhelm ourselves in condemnation. "Man has no right to be damned." He is under the most solemn obligations to be "saved;" and after what God has done for us, deep and dreadful woe will await us if we are so foolish and wicked as to be lost.<p>5. Many of the poor and needy will be saved, while the haughty and rich will perish forever, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9-10</a>.<p>6. Let those who make a profession of religion look often to the great day when Christ will search them, <a href="/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11</a>. There is a day coming that will try us. His eye will be upon us. He will read our hearts, and see whether we are clothed in his righteousness, or only the filthy rags of our own.<p>7. A profession of religion will not save us, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11-13</a>. It is foolish to deceive ourselves. Nothing but genuine piety, true faith in Jesus, and a holy life, will save us. God asks not profession merely, but the heart. He asks not mockery, but sincerity; not pretension, but reality.<p>8. The hypocrite must perish, <a href="/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>. It is right that he should perish. He knew his Master's will and would not do it. He must perish with an awful condemnation. No man sins amid so much light, none with so high a hand. No sin is so awful as to attempt to deceive God, and to palm pretensions on him for reality.<p>9. Pretended friends are sometimes more dangerous than avowed enemies, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. Pretended friendship is often for the purpose of decoying us into evil. It throws us off our guard, and we are more easily taken.<p>10. The truth is often admitted by wicked people from mere hypocrisy, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. It is only for the purpose of deceiving others and leading them into sin.<p>11. Wicked people can decide correctly on the character of a public preacher, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. They often admit his claim in words, but for an evil purpose.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 22:41-46. Christ Baffles the Pharisees by a Question about David and Messiah. ( = Mr 12:35-37; Lu 20:41-44).<p>For the exposition, see on [1344]Mr 12:35-37.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 41-46. Mark hath this story shortly, repeating only the substance of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/12-35.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?...">Mark 12:35-37</a></span>; adding nothing to it, but concluding, <span class="ital">And the common people heard him gladly.</span> Luke repeateth it as shortly, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/20-41.htm" title="And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?">Luke 20:41</a>,44</span>. For the right understanding of this discourse of our Saviour to the Pharisees, we must know, that though the Pharisees and the Jews in general did expect a Messiah or a Christ, yet they expected no more of him, or in him, than that he should be a man, the son of David, descended from his family, according to the promise, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a></span>; and dreamed only of a secular prince, who should deliver them from their enemies, and restore them to their ancient civil liberties. Christ seeing a pack of them together, took the liberty, which he had allowed them towards himself, to propound a question or two to them. His question was, <span class="ital">What think ye of Christ?</span> Not of himself, but of the Messiah whom they expected; whose Son he should be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They say unto him, The Son of David, </span> that is, one who should in a right line be descended from David. This was a constant and uncontrolled tradition amongst them. Hence Mark saith, the question was propounded, <span class="ital">How say the scribes?</span> Luke, <span class="ital">How say they that Christ is, </span> that is, is to be, <span class="ital">the Son of David?</span> This was a commonly received opinion amongst them, which our Saviour by the next words doth not contradict, but only argues that he must needs be something more; for, saith he, <span class="ital">How then doth David in spirit call him Lord?</span> <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a></span>.

Would David have called him Lord, whom he knew to be merely his son, one that should only descend from him? He would have said, The Lord said to my son, or, will say to my son. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The Lord said, </span> Jehovah said, <span class="ital">unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand.</span> Would David, speaking prophetically by the Holy Ghost concerning the Messiah, had he believed he was to be his son, and no more, have said that Jehovah should say unto him, <span class="ital">Sit at my right hand, </span> a place of the highest honour, dignity, and favour, <span class="ital">until I make thine enemies thy footstool, </span> that is, for ever? For <span class="ital">until</span> doth not signify a determinate time. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</span> That is, how is he then no more than his son, no more than a mere man? Our Saviour by this argument doth neither go about to prove that the Christ was not to be the Son of David, nor that he was the Messias himself, but that their expected Messias or Christ must be more than a mere man, otherwise David would never have called him Lord, nor yet prophesied that Jehovah should call him to sit at his right hand. Matthew concludes with telling us, that as the Sadducees and the scribes were nonplussed before, so now the Pharisees’ mouths were also stopped. Mark saith, <span class="ital">The common people heard him gladly.</span> Matthew saith, <span class="ital">No man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man ask him any more questions.</span> Nor shall we hear of their troubling him with disputes any more; they now see disputing will not do their business, their next business is to consult how to take away his life; which is always the course of proud and malicious men, given over of God to ruin, to conceal their convictions, and proceed to execute their lusts and malice, rather than they will not have their ends. But before they meet with a fit opportunity we shall have some excellent discourses from our Saviour to the disciples and the multitude. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/matthew/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And no man was able to answer him a word,....
