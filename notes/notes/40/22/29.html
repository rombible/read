On the whole, while distinctly condemning and refuting their characteristic error, the tone in which He speaks is less stern than that in which He addresses the Pharisees. They were less characterised by hypocrisy, and that, as the <span class= "ital">pessima corruptio optimi,</span> was that which called down His sternest reproof. The causes of their error were, He told them, two-fold: (1) an imperfect knowledge even of the Scriptures which they recognised; (2) imperfect conceptions of the divine attributes, and therefore an <span class= "ital">à priori</span> limitation of the divine power. They could not conceive of any human fellowship in the life of the resurrection except such as reproduced the relations and conditions of this earthly life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/22-29.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God....">Matthew 22:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures </span>— Which plainly assert a future state; <span class="ital">nor the power of God </span>— Who created spirit as well as matter, and can preserve it in existence when the body is dissolved, and can also raise the body from the dust and render it immortal; and who can make the whole man completely happy in the knowledge, love, and enjoyment of himself, without any of the pleasures or objects of this visible and temporal world. <span class="ital">For in the resurrection they neither marry,</span> &c. — Our Lord proceeds to observe further, that they entirely mistook the nature of the life to be enjoyed in a future state: that those who attained it being as the angels of God, incorruptible and immortal, marriage and the procreation of an offspring were no longer necessary to continue the species, or maintain the population of the spiritual world.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:23-33 The doctrines of Christ displeased the infidel Sadducees, as well as the Pharisees and Herodians. He carried the great truths of the resurrection and a future state, further than they had yet been reveled. There is no arguing from the state of things in this world, as to what will take place hereafter. Let truth be set in a clear light, and it appears in full strength. Having thus silenced them, our Lord proceeded to show the truth of the doctrine of the resurrection from the books of Moses. God declared to Moses that he was the God of the patriarchs, who had died long before; this shows that they were then in a state of being, capable of enjoying his favour, and proves that the doctrine of the resurrection is clearly taught in the Old Testament as well as in the New. But this doctrine was kept for a more full revelation, after the resurrection of Christ, who was the first-fruits of them that slept. All errors arise from not knowing the Scriptures and the power of God. In this world death takes away one after another, and so ends all earthly hopes, joys, sorrows, and connexions. How wretched are those who look for nothing better beyond the grave!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye do err, not knowing ... - They had taken a wrong view of the doctrine of the resurrection.<p>It was not taught that people would marry there. The "Scriptures," here, mean the books of the Old Testament. By appealing to them, Jesus showed that the doctrine of the future state was there, and that the Sadducees should have believed it as it was, and not have added the absurd doctrine to it that people must live there as they do here. The way in which the enemies of the truth often attempt to make a doctrine of the Bible ridiculous is by adding to it, and then calling it absurd. The reason why the Saviour produced a passage from the books of Moses <a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a> was that they had also appealed to his writings, <a href="/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>. Other places of the Old Testament, in fact, asserted the doctrine more clearly <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, but he wished to meet them on their own ground. None of those scriptures asserted that people would live there as they do here, and therefore their reasoning was false.<p>Nor the power of God - They probably denied, as many have done since, that God could gather the scattered dust of the dead and remould it into a body. On this ground they affirmed that the doctrine could not be true - opposing reason to revelation, and supposing that infinite power could not reorganize a body that it had at first organized, and raise a body from its own dust which it had at first raised from nothing.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 22:15-40.

The Sadducees: as idle and impertinent as the case they put may seem to be and really was, our Lord thought fit to return an answer to them, thereby to expose their ignorance, and put them to silence and confusion: ye do err; not only in that they denied the immortality of the soul and the resurrection, but that supposing that there would be a resurrection, things in that state would be just they were in this; as particularly for instance, that there would be the same natural relation of husband and wife, which their question supposes. Mark reads these words by way of interrogation, <p>do ye not therefore err, because? &amp;c. And by Luke they are wholly omitted, as also what follows, <p>not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. These two things were the spring and source of their errors: they had not a true knowledge, and right understanding of the Scriptures; which if they had had, it must have appeared to them, from many places in the Old Testament, that the soul remains after death, and that the body will be raised from the dead: they owned the authority of the Scriptures, and allowed of all the writings of the Old Testament; for it seems to be a mistake of some learned men, who think that they only received the five books of Moses, and that therefore Christ takes his proof of his doctrine from thence; but though they had the greater esteem for the law, and would admit of nothing that was not clearly proved from that; yet they did not reject the other writings, as what might serve to confirm and illustrate what was taught in the law; but then, though they approved of the Scriptures and read them, yet they did not understand them, and so fell into those gross errors and sad mistakes; nor did they attend to the power of God, which, as it was able to make men out of the dust of the earth, was able to raise them again, when crumbled into dust; but this was looked upon by them, as a thing impossible, and so incredible; see <a href="/acts/26-8.htm">Acts 26:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/22.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/22-29.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.">Matthew 22:29</a>.
