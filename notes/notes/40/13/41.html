In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Declare unto us - That is, explain the meaning of the parable. This was done in so plain a manner as to render comment unnecessary. The Son of man, the Lord Jesus, sows the good seed - that is, preaches the gospel. This he did personally, and does now by his ministers, his providence, and his Spirit, by all the means of conveying "truth" to the mind. This seed was, by various means, to be carried over all the world. It was to be confined to no particular nation or people. The good seed was the children of the kingdom; that is, of the kingdom of God, or Christians. For these the Saviour toiled and died. They are the fruit of his labors. Yet amid them were wicked people; and all hypocrites and unbelievers in the church are the work of Satan. Yet they must remain together until the end, when they shall be separated, and the righteous saved and the wicked lost. The one shall shine clear as the sun, the other be cast into a furnace of fire - a most expressive image of suffering.<p>We have no idea of more acute suffering than to be thrown into the fire, and to have our bodies made capable of bearing the burning heat, and living on m this burning heat forever and forever. It is not certain that our Saviour meant to teach here that hell is made up of "material" fire; but it is certain that he meant to teach that this would be a proper "representation" of the sufferings of the lost. We may be further assured that the Redeemer would not deceive us, or use words to torment and tantalize us. He would not talk of hell-fire which had no existence, nor would the Saviour of people hold out frightful images merely to terrify mankind. If he has spoken of hell, then there is a hell. If he meant to say that the wicked shall suffer, then they will suffer. If he did not mean to deceive mankind, then there is a hell, and then the wicked will be punished. The impenitent, therefore, should be alarmed. And the righteous, however much wickedness they may see, and however many hypocrites there may be in the church, should be cheered with the prospect that soon the just will be separated from the unjust, and that they shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.

There are two answers: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The two phrases bring out different aspects under which the persons are regarded. They, as "sons of the evil one," are both stumbling blocks to others ("the sons of the kingdom"), and also active workers of lawlessness (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>).

The former of the two answers seems preferable, as keeping closer to the parable. It also agrees with the personal use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a>, and the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> alone in the next clause. With respect to the whole phrase, observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is taken partly from <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> (Hebrew), "I will consume [the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span> would readily lend itself to the interpretation 'gather']... the stumbling blocks with the wicked (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5de;&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>... <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e1;&#x5e4;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet, as it stands, it is taken partly also from <a href="/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>, for the Greek of <span class="accented">them that do iniquity is</span> the same as in the LXX. there. Besides, the context (comp.
