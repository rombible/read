Without that, the will and the power were alike thwarted. St. Mark adds, with more precision, that He “laid His hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.”<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/matthew/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he did not, </span>(Mark says, <span class="ital">he could not do,</span>) <span class="ital">many mighty works, because of their unbelief </span>— On which words it has been justly observed, that they are not to be understood so strictly as if the power of Christ was here disarmed; but only, that as they brought but few sick people to him for a cure, he did not judge it proper to obtrude his miracles upon them. On the same principle it is, that faith, in some cases, though not in all, is made the condition of receiving a cure. And Christ saw it proper to make it so here, as well he might, considering what they must undoubtedly have heard of him from other places, and what they had confessed themselves but just before, of mighty works being wrought by his hands; which shows, indeed, that their unbelief did not so much consist in a doubt of his miraculous power, as of his divine mission, which, to any unprejudiced person’s mind, that power so abundantly proved. “The reasons,” says Mr. Wesley, “why many mighty works are not wrought now, is not, that the faith is every where planted; but that unbelief everywhere prevails.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:53-58 Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours.

This implies that he performed some miracles. Mark tells us what they were: "He laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them," <a href="/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a>.<p>Because of their unbelief - That is, it would have been useless to the great purposes of his mission to have worked miracles there. We are not to suppose that his power was limited by the belief or unbelief of people; but they were so "prejudiced," so set against him, that they were not in a condition to "judge of evidence" and to be convinced. They would have charged it to derangement, or sorcery, or the agency of the devil. Compare <a href="/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>. It would have been of no use, therefore, in proving to them that he was from God, to have worked miracles. He did, therefore, only those things which were the proper work of benevolence, and which could not easily be charged on the devil. He gave "sufficient" proof of his mission, and left them in their chosen unbelief without excuse. It is also true, in spiritual things, that the unbelief of a people prevents the influences of the Holy Spirit from being sent down to bless them. God requires faith. He hears only the prayers of faith. And when there is little true belief, and prayer is cold and formal, there the people sleep in spiritual death and are unblessed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>58.

Some he did, though not many; partly that they might be left inexcusable, and partly that it might not be said, he did not wish well, to his own country: what he did, were not of the first class, and greatest note; he only "laid his hands", as Mark says, <a href="/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a> "upon a few sick folk, and healed them"; and yet these were such as raised their wonder and astonishment, but did not command their faith, and were rather stumbling blocks unto them; such were their prejudices, their unbelief, and the hardness of their hearts: and the reason indeed why he did no more was, <p>because of their unbelief. These words in Mark are joined with this expression, "he marvelled"; showing, that their continued unbelief in him, notwithstanding his ministry and miracles among them, was matter of surprise to him; but here they are given as a reason why he did no more mighty works among them: and which Mark says he could not do, not for want of power, or as if their unbelief was too mighty for him to overcome; but he would not, because he judged them unworthy, and that it was not fit and convenient to perform any more, since they were offended with what was done; and that their condemnation might not be increased. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/matthew/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/matthew/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐποίησεν</span>] In <a href="/mark/6-5.htm" title="And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.">Mark 6:5</a>, put more definitely thus: <span class="greekheb">ἠδύνατο ποιῆσαι</span>.
