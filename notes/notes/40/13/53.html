<span class="ital">he departed thence, </span>(see <a href="/mark/6-1.htm" title="And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.">Mark 6:1</a>,) and came once more <span class="ital">into his own country — </span>Namely, Nazareth: but with no better success than he had had there before: for though he preached in their synagogue with such wisdom and eloquence that they were astonished, and also performed some miracles, yet the Nazarenes were not disposed to believe on him, taking offence at the poverty and meanness of his family and relations. They said, therefore, <span class="ital">Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? </span>— Whence? certainly from above, for you yourselves acknowledge that they are too extraordinary to be ascribed to a poor uneducated man. <span class="ital">Is not this the carpenter’s son? </span>— In Mark it is, <span class="ital">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary? </span>— Although the word, <span class="greekheb">ο τεκτων</span>, rendered <span class="ital">carpenter, </span>may mean one that works either in wood, iron, or stone, yet it is probable that a <span class="ital">carpenter, </span>properly so called, is here intended. Accordingly Justin Martyr tells us that Jesus, before he entered on his public ministry, was employed in this occupation: and the ancient Christians were all of the same opinion. The Jewish canons required that all parents should teach their children some trade; and, probably, the poverty of the family engaged Christ, while he was at home with Joseph, to work at his. What an additional proof is this of the humiliation of the blessed Redeemer for our sakes! The four persons here mentioned and termed the <span class="ital">brethren </span>of Christ, it appears, were <span class="ital">his cousins, </span>the sons of his mother’s sister, the wife of Cleophas, or Alpheus. By <span class="ital">James </span>is meant James <span class="ital">the Less, </span>whom St. Paul calls <span class="ital">the Lord’s brother, </span><a href="/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>. <span class="ital">Joses, </span>or <span class="ital">Joseph, </span>(for the name is the same,) is the only son of the virgin’s sister, who never was an apostle. <span class="ital">Simon </span>is the same who is called the <span class="ital">Canaanite, </span>or <span class="ital">Zelotes, </span>to distinguish him from Simon Peter. And <span class="ital">Judas, </span>or <span class="ital">Jude, </span>is the author of the epistle that goes under that name: wherein he is styled <span class="ital">the brother of James.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:53-58 Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made our peace with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/matthew/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus kindly asked them whether they had understood these things. If not, he was still willing to teach them. He enjoined on them their duty to make a proper use of this knowledge by speaking another parable.<p>Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven - That is, every man that is acquainted with the gospel or with the truth. As the disciples had said that they had understood the truth, he says that it should not be unemployed. They should bring it forth in due time, like a householder bringing out of his treasury, or place of deposit, what had been laid up there at any time, as it was needed.<p>Bringeth forth - As occasion demands; as sickness, or calamity, or the wants of his family, or the poor require.<p>Treasure - The word "treasure" here means a place of deposit, not for money merely, but for anything necessary for the comfort of a family. It is the same as "treasury" or a place of "deposit."<p>New and old - Things lately acquired, or things that had been laid up for a long time. So, said Christ, you, my disciples, are to be. The truth, new or old, which you have gained, keep it not laid up and hid, but bring it forth, in due season and on proper occasions, to benefit others. Every preacher should be properly instructed. Christ for three years gave instructions to the apostles; and they who preach should be able to understand the gospel, to defend it, and to communicate it to others. Human learning alone is indeed of no value to a minister; but all learning that will enable a man better to understand the Bible and communicate its truths is valuable, and should, if possible, be gained. A minister should be like the father of a family - distributing to the church as it needs; and out of his treasures bringing forth truth to confirm the feeble, to enlighten the ignorant, and to recover and guide those who are in danger of straying away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/matthew/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 13:53-58.

The majority of more recent critics (Lichtenstein, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 271 ff., de Wette, Baur, Bleek, Köstlin, Holtzmann, Keim) adhere to the view, received with special favour since Schleiermacher, that this narrative (which, moreover, in <a href="/mark/6-1.htm" title="And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.">Mark 6:1</a> ff., comes after the raising of Jairus’ daughter) is identical with <a href="/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read....">Luke 4:16-30</a>.

In Mk. this is the next section after the parables, deducting what had previously been reported in Mt. (chaps. 8 and 9), a pretty sure sign that our evangelist has Mk. under his eye. We can here see how he handles his source—substantial reproduction of the contents, no slavish copying of style, editorial discretion in reporting certain details. No attempt should be made to connect with the foregoing passage, except perhaps by the general category of prevalent un-receptivity to which also the following narrative (<a href="/context/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,...">Matthew 14:1-12</a>) may be relegated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">53–58</span>.
