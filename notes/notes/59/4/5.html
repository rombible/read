Nearly to the same purpose is Doddridge’s paraphrase of the verse: “Do you think the Scripture speaks in vain in all the passages in which it guards us against such a temper as this, and leads the mind directly to God as the supreme good, teaching us to abandon every thing for him? Or does the Holy Spirit, that dwells in us Christians, lust to envy? Does it encourage these worldly affections, this strife and envying which we have reproved?

Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain - Few passages of the New Testament have given expositors more perplexity than this. The difficulty has arisen from the fact that no such passage as that which seems here to be quoted is found in the Old Testament; and to meet this difficulty, expositors have resorted to various conjectures and solutions. Some have supposed that the passage is spurious, and that it was at first a gloss in the margin, placed there by some transcriber, and was then introduced into the text; some that the apostle quotes from an apocryphal book; some, that he quotes the general spirit of the Old Testament rather than any particular place; some regard it not as a quotation, but read the two members separately, supplying what is necessary to complete the sense, thus: "Do you think that the Scripture speaks in vain, or without a good reason, when it condemns such a worldly temper? No; that you cannot suppose. Do you imagine that the Spirit of God, which dwelleth in us Christians, leads to covetousness, pride, envy? No. On the contrary, to such as follow his guidance and direction, he gives more abundant grace and favor." This is the solution proposed by Benson, and adopted by Bloomfield. But this solution is by no means satisfactory. Two things are clear in regard to the passage:<p>(1) that James meant to adduce something that was said somewhere, or which could be regarded as a quotation, or as authority in the case, for he uses the formula by which such quotations are made; and,<p>(2) that he meant to refer, not to an apocryphal book, but to the inspired and canonical Scriptures, for he uses a term &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768;  he&#772; graphe&#772; - the Scripture) which is everywhere employed to denote the Old Testament, and which is nowhere applied to an apocryphal book, <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-29.htm">Matthew 22:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-54.htm">Matthew 26:54</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>; <a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>, <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>, et al. The word is used more than fifty times in the New Testament, and is never applied to any books but those which were regarded by the Jews as inspired, and which constitute now the Old Testament, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>, where it refers to the writings of Paul. The difficulty in the case arises from the fact that no such passage as the one here quoted is found in so many words in the Old Testament, nor any of which it can fairly be regarded as a quotation. The only solution of the difficulty which seems to me to be at all satisfactory, is to suppose that the apostle, in the remark made here in the form of a quotation, refers to the Old Testament, but that he had not his eye on any particular passage, and did not mean to quote the words literally, but meant to refer to what was the current teaching or general spirit of the Old Testament; or that he meant to say that this sentiment was found there, and designed himself to embody the sentiment in words, and to put it into a condensed form.<p>His eye was on envy as at the bottom of many of the contentions and strifes existing on earth, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>, and of the spirit of the world which prevailed everywhere, <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>; and he refers to the general teaching of the Old Testament that the soul is by nature inclined to envy; or that this has a deep lodgement in the heart of man. That truth which was uttered every where in the Scriptures, was not taught "in vain." The abundant facts which existed showing its developement and operation in contentions, and wars, and a worldly spirit, proved that it was deeply imbedded in the human soul. This general truth, that man is prone to envy, or that there is much in our nature which inclines us to it, is abundantly taught in the Old Testament. <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>, "I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor." <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>, "wrath killeth, and envy slayeth the silly one." <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>, "envy is the rottenness of the bones." <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>, "who is able to stand before envy?" For particular instances of this, and the effects, see <a href="/genesis/26-14.htm">Genesis 26:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-16.htm">Psalm 106:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>. These passages prove that there is a strong propensity in human nature to envy, and it was in accordance with the design of the apostle to show this. The effects of envy to which be himself referred evinced the same thing, and demonstrated that the utterance given to this sentiment in the Old Testament was not "in vain," or was not false, for the records in the Old Testament on the subject found a strong confirmation in the wars and strifes and worldliness of which he was speaking.<p>Saith in vain - Says falsely;" that is, the testimony thus borne is true. The apostle means that what was said in the Old Testament on the subject found abundant confirmation in the facts which were continually occurring, and especially in those to which he was adverting.<p>The spirit that dwelleth in us - Many have supposed that the word "spirit" here refers to the Holy Spirit, or the Christian spirit; but in adopting this interpretation they are obliged to render the passage, "the spirit that dwells in us lusteth against envy," or tends to check and suppress it. But this interpretation is forced and unnatural, and one which the Greek will not well bear. The more obvious interpretation is to refer it to our spirit or disposition as we are by nature, and it is equivalent to saying that we are naturally prone to envy.<p>Lusteth to envy - Strongly tends to envy. The margin is "enviously," but the sense is the same. The idea is, that there is in man a strong inclination to look with dissatisfaction on the superior happiness and prosperity of others; to desire to make what they possess our own; or at any rate to deprive them of it by detraction, by fraud, or by robbery. It is this feeling which leads to calumny, to contentions, to wars, and to that strong worldly ambition which makes us anxious to surpass all others, and which is so hostile to the humble and contented spirit of religion. He who could trace all wars and contentions and worldly plans to their source - all the schemes and purposes of even professed Christians, that do so much to mar their religion and to make them worldly-minded, to their real origin - would be surprised to find how much is to be attributed to envy. We are pained that others are more prosperous than we are; we desire to possess what others have, though we have no right to it; and this leads to the various guilty methods which are pursued to lessen their enjoyment of it, or to obtain it ourselves, or to show that they do not possess as much as they are commonly supposed to. This purpose will be accomplished if we can obtain more than they have; or if we can diminish what they actually possess; or if by any statements to which we can give currency in society, the general impression shall be that they do not possess as much wealth, domestic peace, happiness, or honor, as is commonly supposed - for thus the spirit of envy in our bosoms will be gratified. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. in vain&#8212;No word of Scripture can be so. The quotation here, as in Eph 5:14, seems to be not so much from a particular passage as one gathered by James under inspiration from the general tenor of such passages in both the Old and New Testaments, as Nu 14:29; Pr 21:20; Ga 5:17.<p>spirit that dwelleth in us&#8212;Other manuscripts read, "that God hath made to dwell in us" (namely, at Pentecost). If so translated, "Does the (Holy) Spirit that God hath placed in us lust to (towards) envy" (namely, as ye do in your worldly "wars and fightings")? Certainly not; ye are therefore walking in the flesh, not in the Spirit, while ye thus lust towards, that is, with envy against one another. The friendship of the world tends to breed envy; the Spirit produces very different fruit. Alford attributes the epithet "with envy," in the unwarrantable sense of jealously, to the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit jealously desires us for His own." In English Version the sense is, "the (natural) spirit that hath its dwelling in us lusts with (literally, 'to,' or 'towards') envy." Ye lust, and because ye have not what ye lust after (Jas 4:1, 2), ye envy your neighbor who has, and so the spirit of envy leads you on to "fight." James also here refers to Jas 3:14, 16.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain?</span> Greek, emptily, or vainly, i.e. to no purpose.

This latter clause may either be read interrogatively or affirmatively; and then according as we take <span class="ital">spirit, </span> either for the Spirit of God, or the human spirit, the sense of the words may be either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Doth the Spirit of God, that dwelleth in us, lust unto envy, i.e. incline and dispose us to so base an affection? The answer is understood: No, and confirmed by the next words, <span class="ital">he giveth more grace, </span> gives freely, liberally, and therefore doth not make us envy others any good they have. Nothing is more contrary to the Spirit of God, who abounds in his gifts to us, than to make us envy others theirs. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. We may understand it without any interrogation, taking the preposition to signify, against; and then the sense is: That good Spirit which is in us teacheth us better things than strife and envy, &c., for it lusteth against envy, i.e. makes us lust against it, carries out our hearts to hate and resist it. And this well agrees with what follows; The Spirit, &c., lusts against envy, but he gives more grace, viz. than to envy the good f others. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. If <span class="ital">spirit</span> here be understood of the spirit of man, corrupt nature, the sense is plain, as the words lie; man’s spirit (especially by the instigation of the devil) lusts, or strongly inclines, to envy, and consequently to other wickednesses, but he (that is, God, <span class="bld"><a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">Jam 4:4</a></span>) gives more grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Question.</span> Where is any such sentence to be found in the Scripture? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> No where in so many words; but which soever of these ways we take the words, we find the sense in the Scripture.

The views of expositors differ widely in the interpretation of these verses. At first sight the words following <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> appear to be a quotation from the O. T. which James has in view. That of the older and some of the more recent expositors assume this to be the case, although they differ from each other, some combining <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span> directly with <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, but others including it in the quotation Against this explanation, however, is the circumstance that the words supposed to be here quoted nowhere occur in the O. T. Such a passage has accordingly been sought for, where a similar thought is expressed, but almost every expositor has fixed upon a different passage. Many expositors seek to remove the difficulty by supposing that James does not here quote any single definite passage, but only a sentiment contained in the O. T. generally, or in several of its expressions. Opposed to this idea, however, is, first, the uncertainty whether James will confirm by it the statement contained in what precedes or in what follows; and secondly, the formula of quotation pointing to a definite passage, particularly as <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> is not = <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span>. But, moreover, the clause <span class="greekheb">μείζονα δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν</span> is against the view here indicated, since these words cannot be reckoned as part of the quotation, because James only afterwards quotes the O. T. passage from which they are derived; but, also, they cannot be considered as a statement of James not belonging to the quotation, because <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> closely connects them to what directly precedes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The various O.

Semler thinks that the passage is here cited from the “Testimony of the Twelve Patriarchs;” and Gabler, that the words are borrowed from a lost prophetical book. In recent times, Engelhardt (Remarks on <a href="/context/james/4-5.htm" title="Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?...">Jam 4:5-6</a>, in the <span class="ital">Ztschr. f. d.

Wolf, Heinsius, and Zachariae refer the words to the thoughts contained in what follows; Theile, de Wette, Brückner (also first edition of this commentary), to the thoughts contained in what precedes—that the friendship of the world is enmity with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If the words <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. do not form the quotation belonging to <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφὴ λέγει</span>, it is to be assumed that James here already had in view the scripture adduced after <span class="greekheb">διὸ λέγει</span> in <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">Jam 4:6</a>, but that he did not yet state it, because the sentiment expressed in those words obtruded itself upon him in confirmation of <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενῶς</span> (Wiesinger). <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span> cannot, as Gebser and others suppose, be united with <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>; for if one takes it to be equivalent to de invidia or contra invidia, there is this against it, that in what goes before there is no mention of <span class="ital">envy;</span> or if it is taken adverbially, then it appears as an appendage dragging after <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενῶς</span>, which would be added the more unsuitably, because, as de Wette correctly remarks, it cannot be perceived what meaning can be attached to the assurance that the scripture does not speak <span class="ital">enviously.</span> Most expositors rightly refer it to <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖ</span>, which, without the addition, would be too bare; it is added to this idea as an adverbial and more exact statement = <span class="ital">in an envious, jealous manner</span>, for the sake of strengthening it. It is linguistically incorrect to explain <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖν</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμεῖν κατὰ φθόνον</span>, <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a> (thus Luther: “the spirit lusteth against envy;” Bengel, Stier; also Lange: “the spirit longeth over against and in opposition to envy”), since <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>, although it may be used in a hostile relation (<a href="/luke/23-12.htm" title="And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.">Luke 23:12</a>; <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>), yet does not <span class="ital">in itself</span> express a hostile reference. The explanation of many ancient and some recent expositors (Bede, Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Hottinger, Gabler, Bouman, and others), taking <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span> = <span class="ital">ad invidiam</span>, is also unsuitable; for, on the one hand, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖν</span> is not = proclivem esse, and, on the other hand, it is contradicted by the connection in which there is not the slightest allusion to <span class="ital">envy.</span> With the correct explanation of <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα ὃ κατῴκησεν</span> (<span class="greekheb">κατῴκισεν</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> is either subjective, “the Spirit of God,” or objective, “the spirit of man.” In the first case <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖ</span> has no object. De Wette, Brückner (so also Schneckenburger and some of the other expositors) supply <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> as the object. Engelhardt, on the contrary, will supply no object, thinking “the supposed translation of the verb <span class="greekheb">קִנֵּא</span> is conclusive against an object;” but <span class="greekheb">קִנֵּא</span> requires an object no less than <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖν</span>, as it is, as well as the other, a relative (not an absolute) verb. By this interpretation <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> is to be understood of Christians, in whom the Holy Spirit (according to Engelhardt: “by the covenant of baptism”) has taken up His abode. In the second case, the subject is not expressed. Wiesinger supplies <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>. There is no difficulty in this completion, the less so as the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span>, which, in connection with <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, is personified (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a>, <span class="greekheb">προιδοῦσα ἡ γραφή</span>), points to God, with whom it is, as it were, identified. This second explanation would deserve the preference before the first, as it is not apparent why James here, instead of simply God, should name the Holy Spirit, whom he has not elsewhere mentioned in his whole Epistle, and because the specification of an object belonging to <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖ</span>, which is essentially required for the thought, can scarcely be wanting. Certainly, in this second interpretation, <span class="greekheb">ὃ κατῴκησεν ἐν ἡμῖν</span> added to <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is difficult, not so much on account of the formation of the expression, as because this addition appears to be a very unimportant remark. But it is otherwise with the reading <span class="greekheb">κατῴκισεν</span>, as then the relative clause marks “the right of propriety as the ground of explanation of envious love” (Wiesinger). According to this view, the passage is to be explained: Or think you that the scripture says in vain—(rather God) enviously desires the spirit which He has made to dwell in us, but He gives the greater grace—wherefore it says, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is yet to be remarked that <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν</span> has the same meaning as in chap. <a href="/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a>; <span class="greekheb">κενῶς</span>, that is, without contents, corresponding to the truth; comp. <span class="greekheb">κενοὶ λόγοι</span>, <a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a> (Plato, Lach. 196b). The adverbial import of <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span> is justified by the usage of the Greek language; see Pape’s Wörterb.: the word <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>; Winer, p. 378 [E. T. 529]; Buttmann, p. 292 f. [E. T. 340]. The verb <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖν</span> is also elsewhere in the N. T. construed with the accusative. The idea that God cherishes an “envious and loving longing” (Wiesinger) after the spirit of man, corresponds to the circle of ideas in the O. T., from which also the preceding <span class="greekheb">μοιχαλίδες</span> is to be explained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The principal objections of Engelhardt—that the two members of the 5th and 6th verses are not in congruity, and that the scripture adduced in <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">Jam 4:6</a> does not prove the thought expressed in <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">Jam 4:4</a>—are solved by the observation that the friendship of the world, in which man opposes himself to the will of God, is pride, and that those to whom God gives grace are none other than the humble, who disdain to be the arrogant friends of the world. It is erroneous when Engelhardt denies that an emphasis rests on <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενῶς</span>, so that the grammatical construction forbids to make the idea <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. intervene as a contrast to <span class="greekheb">κενῶς</span>; the asyndeton form is, besides, wholly suitable to James’ mode of expression; moreover, Engelhardt on his part finds himself constrained to supply a transitionary thought before <span class="greekheb">μείζονα δὲ δίδωσιν</span>. That James does not quote the scripture intended by him directly after the first <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, but defers it because he wished to emphasize that it was not vain and empty, may well surprise us, but it is to be explained from the liveliness peculiar to James. Moreover, in <a href="/context/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture said of Elias? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,...">Romans 11:2-4</a>, although not in the same, yet in a similar manner, the passage quoted is separated from the form of quotation: <span class="greekheb">τί λέγει ἡ γραφή</span>, and in such a manner that the formula itself is taken up again by an <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, referring to the intervening remark, before the intended passage. When Engelhardt thinks that the words in consideration are to be recognised as the quotation, because they are words which do not elsewhere occur in James, apart from this being anything but conclusive, it is, on the contrary, to be observed that <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> understood of the human spirit already occurs in chap. <a href="/james/2-26.htm" title="For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.">Jam 2:26</a>, and that the words <span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖν</span> do not occur in the passages of the O. T. which James, according to Engelhardt’s opinion, had in view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/4-5.htm" title="Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?">Jam 4:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφὴ λέγει πρὸς φθόνον</span> …: this attributing of personality to Scripture is paralleled, as Lightfoot points out (<span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a></span>), by the not uncommon Jewish formula of reference <span class="greekheb">מה ראה</span> “Quid vidit”. According to Lightfoot the singular <span class="greekheb">γραφὴ</span> in the N.T. “always means a <span class="ital">particular passage</span> of Scripture; where the reference is clearly to the sacred writings as a whole, as in the expressions, ‘searching the Scriptures,’ ‘learned in the Scriptures,’ etc., the plural <span class="greekheb">γραφαί</span> is universally found, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/acts/17-11.htm" title="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.">Acts 17:11</a>; <a href="/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24</a>; <a href="/acts/18-28.htm" title="For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:28</a>.… <span class="greekheb">Ἡ γραφὴ</span> is most frequently used in introducing a particular quotation, and in the very few instances where the quotation is not actually given, it is for the most part easy to fix the passage referred to. The biblical usage is followed also by the earliest fathers. The transition from the ‘Scriptures’ to the ‘Scripture’ is analogous to the transition from <span class="greekheb">τὰ βιβλία</span> to the ‘Bible’ ” (<span class="ital">ibid.</span>, pp. 147 f.). In the present instance the “Scripture” is nowhere to be found in the O.T.; it is, however, reflected in some Pauline passages, <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/8-6.htm" title="For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.">Romans 8:6</a>; <a href="/romans/8-8.htm" title="So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.">Romans 8:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἡ γὰρ σὰρξ ἐπιθυμεῖ κατὰ τοῦ πνεύματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ πνεῦμα κατὰ τῆς σαρκός</span> (<a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>); <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). It is difficult not to see a Pauline influence in our passage; and what is certainly noteworthy is the fact that the two <span class="ital">Agrapha</span> which the Epistle contains (<a href="/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">Jam 1:12</a> and the one before us) are both closely connected with St. Paul, <a href="/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">Jam 1:12</a> = <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a> = <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>. But that which is conclusive against the “Scripture” here referring to the O.T. is the fact that the doctrine of the Spirit is not found there in the developed form in which it is represented here; the pronounced personality of the Spirit as here used is never found in the O.T. The reference here must be to the N.T., and this is one of the many indications which point to the late date of our Epistle, or parts of it. As early a document as the Epistle of Polycarp (110 A.D.) refers once to the N.T. quotations as “Scripture”; and in the Epistle of Barnabas (about 98 A.D. according to Lightfoot, but regarded as later by most scholars) a N.T. quotation is prefaced by the formula “It is written”.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ</span> …: on this very difficult text see, for a variety of interpretations, Mayor’s elaborate note; the best rendering seems to be that of the R.V. margin: “That Spirit which he made to dwell in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy”. The words witness to the truth that the third Person of the Holy Trinity abides in our hearts striving to acquire the same love for Him on our part which He bears for us. It is a most striking passage which tells of the love of the Holy Spirit, as (in one sense) distinct from that of the Father or that of the Son; in connection with it should be read <a href="/context/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered....">Romans 8:26-28</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</span>] The words present a two-fold difficulty: (1) They are quoted as Scripture, and yet no such words are found either in the Canonical or even in the Apocryphal Books of the Old Testament.

If we can determine the latter point, it may, perhaps, help us in dealing with the former, (<span class="ital">a</span>) The better MSS., it may be noted, to begin with, give a different reading of the first words: <span class="bld">The Spirit which he planted</span> (or <span class="bld">made to dwell) in us</span>. If we adopt this reading, it makes it all but absolutely certain that what is predicated of the Spirit must be good, and not, as the English version suggests, evil. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The Greek word for “lusteth” conveys commonly a higher meaning than the English, and is rendered elsewhere by “longing after” (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-26.htm" title="For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick.">Php 2:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.">2 Corinthians 9:14</a>), or “earnestly desiring” (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:">2 Corinthians 5:2</a>), or “greatly desiring” (<a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2 Timothy 1:4</a>). New Testament usage is accordingly in favour of giving the word such a meaning here. The verb has no object, but it is natural to supply the pronoun “us.” Taking these <span class="ital">data</span> we get as the true meaning of the words, <span class="bld">The Spirit which He implanted yearns tenderly over us</span>. (<span class="ital">c</span>) The words that remain, “to envy,” admit of being taken as with an adverbial force. “In a manner tending to envy,” <span class="bld">enviously</span>. The fact that “envy” is elsewhere in the New Testament and elsewhere condemned as simply evil, makes its use here somewhat startling. But the thought implied is that the strongest human affection shews itself in a jealousy which is scarcely distinguishable from “envy.” We grudge the transfer to another of the affection which we claim as ours. We <span class="ital">envy</span> the happiness of that other. In that sense St James says that the Spirit, implanted in us, yearns to make us wholly His and is satisfied with no divided allegiance. He simply treats the Greek word for “envy” as other writers treated the word “jealousy,” which though commonly viewed as evil, was yet treated at times as a parable of the purest spiritual affection (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/context/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them....">Galatians 4:17-18</a>). The root-idea of the passage is accordingly identical with that of the jealousy of God over Israel as His bride (<a href="/context/jeremiah/3-1.htm" title="They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD....">Jeremiah 3:1-11</a>; Ezekiel 16, <a href="/hosea/2-3.htm" title="Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.">Hosea 2:3</a>), of His wrath when the bride proved faithless. Those who had been addressed as “adulteresses” (<a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>), were forgetting this. All that they read of the love or jealousy of God was to them as an idle tale. For “in vain” read <span class="bld">idly, emptily</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There remains the question, in what sense does St James give these words as a quotation from “the Scripture”? No words at all like them in form are found anywhere in the Old Testament, and we have to suppose either (1) that they were cited from some lost book that never found a place in the Hebrew Canon, a supposition, which, though not absolutely impossible, is yet in a very high degree unlikely; or, which seems the more probable explanation, that St James having in his mind the passages above referred to, and many others like them, and finding them too long for quotation, condensed them into one brief pregnant form, which gave the essence of their meaning. A like manner of quoting as Scripture what we do not find in any extant book, is found in Clement of Rome (c. 46), “It has been written, ‘Cleave to the saints, for they who cleave to them shall be sanctified.’ ” As points of detail it may be noted (1) that the Greek word for “yearning” or “longing” occurs in the LXX. version of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.htm" title="As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, and is followed in <a href="/context/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:...">James 4:13-17</a> by an account of the manner in which the love so shewn had been turned to jealousy by the sins of Israel; and (2) that <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>, as in the LXX., “My spirit shall not abide for ever with men,” may have suggested the “indwelling” of which the first member of the sentence speaks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I have given, what seems on the whole, the most tenable explanation of a passage which is admitted on all hands to be one of extreme difficulty. It does not seem desirable to discuss other interpretations at any length, but two or three may be very briefly noticed. (1) The words have been rendered “The Spirit (i. e. the Holy Spirit) that dwelleth in us lusteth against envy,” the contrast being assumed to be parallel to that between the works of the Spirit and those of the flesh in <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>. There is no sufficient authority, however, for giving this meaning to the preposition. (2) The “spirit” has been referred to man’s corrupt will, as “lusting to envy,” in its bad sense, but the description of the Spirit as “implanted” or “dwelling” in us, is against this view. (3) In concurrence with the last interpretation, the question “Do ye think that the Scripture speaks in vain?” has been referred to what precedes the statement, that the friendship of the world is enmity with God; but this is at variance with the usual way in which quotations from the Old Testament are introduced in the New.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/4-5.htm" title="Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?">Jam 4:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κενῶς</span>) <span class="ital">in vain, without effect</span>, so that it matters nothing to guilt or to salvation. Whatever things the Scripture says are serious. We ought to reverence every word.—<span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">saith</span>) not <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">speaks, saith</span> the things which follow.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς φθόνον</span>) <span class="ital">against envy</span>. This noun (<span class="greekheb">φθόνος</span>) does not occur in the Septuagint, and it does not seem probable that James should have wished to make so great a change in this verse, and yet, in <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">Jam 4:6</a>, have made an exact quotation from another passage. We may infer from this, that the quotation here is from the Scriptures of the New Testament: for the writings of the New Testament, as well as the Old, are reckoned in the <span class="ital">Scriptures</span>; <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a>. Some refer it to <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>; or to <a href="/numbers/11-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!">Numbers 11:29</a>; or to <a href="/proverbs/21-10.htm" title="The soul of the wicked desires evil: his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.">Proverbs 21:10</a>; or to some lost book. But the words of James are near enough to <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>, and following verses; where <span class="greekheb">φθόνοι</span>, <span class="ital">envyings</span>, are placed among the works of the flesh, and <span class="ital">the spirit</span> is said to <span class="ital">have desires</span> contrary to the flesh, and they who <span class="ital">are led</span> by this spirit are not <span class="ital">under the law, but under grace</span>. But this passage agrees especially with <a href="/context/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,...">1 Peter 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>. <span class="ital">Laying aside</span>—ENVYINGS, DESIRE <span class="ital">the milk of the word—a</span> SPIRITUAL HOUSE. And that which here follows. But He <span class="ital">giveth more grace</span>, agrees with that, <span class="ital">the Lord is gracious</span>, <a href="/james/4-3.htm" title="You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your lusts.">Jam 4:3</a>. He who has this passage of St Peter well impressed upon his mind, will altogether recognise the reference of St James to it. Nor does the chronological order of the epistles stand in the way. Thus James not only concurs with St Peter, but also with St Paul.—<span class="greekheb">φθόνον</span>) The friendship of the world necessarily produces <span class="ital">envy:</span> the Spirit, which has taken up His dwelling in us, does not bear <span class="ital">envy</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span>) <span class="ital">The Spirit of grace</span> and love.—<span class="greekheb">κατῴκησεν</span>) <span class="ital">takes up His dwelling</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἥμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">in us</span>) Sons, of the New Testament.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The difficulty of the passage is well shown by the hesitation of the Revisers. The first clause is rendered, "<span class="accented">Or</span> think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain?" but as an alternative there is suggested in the margin, "Or think ye that the Scripture saith in vain?" as if the following clause were a quotation from Scripture. And of this following clause three possible renderings are suggested. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">In the text</span>: "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? But he giveth more grace.

But he giveth," etc. Further, it is noted in the margin that some ancient authorities read "dwelleth in us," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which is the reading of the Received Text, and so of the A.V. resting upon K, L; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and B being the primary authorities for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. With regard to the first clause, the rendering of the R.V., "speaketh," may be justified by <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>. It is possible that St. James was intending to quote <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> immediately, but after the introductory formula, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, he interposes with the emphatic question, "Is it to <span class="accented">envy</span>," etc.? and does not arrive at the quotation till ver. 6, when he introduces it with a fresh formula of quotation, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, a looseness of construction which is quite natural in a Hebrew. Other views, for which it is believed there is less to be urged, are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., are a quotation from some (now lost) early Christian writing. On this view the passage is parallel to <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, where a portion of a Christian hymn is introduced by the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That St. James is referring to the general drift rather than to the exact words of several passages of the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3-5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10, 19</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That the allusion is to some passage of the New Testament, either <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a> or <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. Passing on to the translation of the second clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., it must be noted that <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is never used elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. (Wisd. 6:25; 1 Macc. 8:16) or in the apostolic Fathers except in a bad sense. True that <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> teaches us that God is a "<span class="accented">jealous God</span>," but there the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span> by the far nobler word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. Wolf, 'Curae Philippians Crit.,' p. 64, where it is noted that, while <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="accented">a vex media</span>, the same cannot be said of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is always <span class="accented">vitiosa</span>, and is never used by the LXX. <span class="accented">ubi vox Hebraica</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5ea;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5e6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5da;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> This seems to be a fatal objection to the marginal readings of the Revised Version, and to compel us to rest content with that adopted in the text, "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?" or rather, "Is it to <span class="accented">envying</span> that the Spirit...  longs?" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being placed for emphasis at the beginning of the sentence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Do ye think (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>See on <a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>.<p>The scripture (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/12-10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>.
