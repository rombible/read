Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you - Compare <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>. This declaration contains a great and important principle in religion. If we wish the favor of God, we must come to him; nor can we hope for his mercy, unless we approach him and ask him for it. We cannot come literally any nearer to God than we always are, for he is always round about us; but we may come nearer in a spiritual sense. We may address him directly in prayer; we may approach him by meditation on his character; we may draw near to him in the ordinances of religion. We can never hope for his favor while we prefer to remain at a distance from him; none who in fact draw near to him will find him unwilling to bestow on them the blessings which they need.<p>Cleanse your hands, ye sinners - There may possibly be an allusion here to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-16</a>; "Your hands are full of blood; wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil." The heart is the seat of motives and intentions - that by which we devise anything; the hands, the instruments by which we execute our purposes. The hands here are represented as defiled by blood, or by acts of iniquity. To wash or cleanse the hands was, therefore, emblematic of putting away transgression, <a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>. The heathen and the Jews were accustomed to wash their hands before they engaged in public worship. The particular idea here is, that in order to obtain the favor of God, it is necessary to put away our sins; to approach him with a desire to be pure and holy. The mere washing of the hands, in itself, could not recommend us to his favor; but that of which the washing of the hands would be an emblem, would be acceptable in his sight. It may be inferred from what is said here that no one can hope for the favor of God who does not abandon his transgressions. The design of the apostle is, evidently, to state one of the conditions on which we can make an acceptable approach to God. It is indispensable that we come with a purpose and desire to wash ourselves from all iniquity, to put away from us all our transgressions. So David said, "I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar. O Lord," <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>.<p>("To obtain the favor of God, it is necessary to put away our sins" - is somewhat unguarded phraseology. If the favor of God were not obtained but on this condition, none ever would obtain it. The passage is a strong injunction to holiness and singleness of heart: it does not say, however, that by these we obtain acceptance with God. Of his favor, holiness is the fruit, the effect, and not the cause. The sinner must not think of getting quit of his sins to prepare him for going to God by Jesus; but he must first go to Jesus to prepare for laying aside his sins. Yet in every approach to God, it is true there must be a "desire "to be free from sin; and this doubtless is the view of the commentary; indeed it is so expressed, though some words are objectionable.)<p>And purify your hearts - That is, do not rest satisfied with a mere external reformation; with putting away your outward transgressions. There must be a deeper work than that; a work which shall reach to the heart, and which shall purify the affections. This agrees with all the requisitions of the Bible, and is in accordance with what must be the nature of religion. If the heart is wrong, nothing can be right. If, while we seek an external reformation, we still give indulgence to the secret corruptions of the heart, it is clear that we can have no true religion.<p>Ye double-minded - See the notes at <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>. The apostle here seems to have had his eye on those who were vacillating in their purposes; whose hearts were not decidedly fixed, but who were halting between good and evil. The heart was not right in such persons. It was not settled and determined in favor of religion, but vibrated between that and the world. The proper business of such persons, therefore, was to cleanse the heart from disturbing influences, that it might settle down in unwavering attachment to that which is good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

This must be understood consistently with the perfection of God's immensity and omnipresence: the saints draw nigh to God when they present their bodies in his sanctuary; when they tread in his courts, and attend his ordinances; where they always find it good for them to draw nigh unto him; and blessed is the man that approaches to him in faith and fear: they draw nigh to him when they come to the throne of his grace, for grace and mercy to help them; when they draw near to him in prayer with true hearts, and lift them up with their hands to God; when in the exercise of faith and hope they enter within the vail, and come up even to his seat; and lay hold on him as their covenant God and Father; and he draws nigh to them by granting them his gracious presence, by communicating his love to them, by applying the blessings of his grace, by helping them in times of need and distress, and by protecting them from their enemies; the contrary to which is expressed by standing afar off from them. Now this is not to be understood as if men could first draw nigh to God, before he draws nigh to them; for as God first loves, so he first moves; he takes the first step, and, in conversion, turns and draws men to himself; though this does not respect first conversion, but after acts in consequence of it; nor is it to be considered as a condition of the grace and favour of God, in drawing nigh to his people, but is expressive of what is their duty, and an encouragement to it: <p>cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded; the persons addressed are not the profane men of the world, but sinners in Zion, formal professors, hypocritical persons; who speak with a double tongue to men, and who draw nigh to God with their mouths, but not with their hearts; who halt between two opinions, and are unstable in all their ways: cleansing of their hands and hearts denotes the purity of outward conversation, and of the inward affections; and supposes impurity both of flesh and spirit, that the body and all its members, the soul and all its powers and faculties, are unclean; and yet not that men have a power to cleanse themselves, either from the filth of an external conversation, or from inward pollution of the heart; though a man attempts the one, he fails in it; and who can say he has done the other? <a href="/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>. This is not to be done by ceremonial ablutions, moral services, or evangelical ordinances; this is God's work only, as appears from his promises to cleanse his people from their sins, by sprinkling clean water upon them; from the end of Christ's shedding his blood, and the efficacy of it; and from the prayers of the saints, that God would wash them thoroughly from their iniquity, and cleanse them from their sin, and create clean hearts in them: and yet such exhortations are not in vain, since they may be useful to convince men of their pollution, who are pure in their own eyes, as these hypocritical, nominal professors, might be; and to bring them to a sense of their inability to cleanse themselves, and of the necessity of being cleansed elsewhere; and to lead them to inquire after the proper means of cleansing, and so to the fountain of Christ's blood, which only cleanses from all sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.

The words before us seem to be a quotation (inexact) from <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm" title="Therefore turn you to your God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on your God continually.">Hosea 12:6</a> (Sept.), … <span class="greekheb">ἔγγιζε πρὸς τὸν θεόν σου διὰ παντός</span>. The Hebrew phrase <span class="greekheb">נגשׁ אל־</span> is a technical term for approaching God for the purpose of worship, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/exodus/19-22.htm" title="And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.">Exodus 19:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm" title="And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 30:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-13.htm" title="And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.">Ezekiel 44:13</a>. There is an extraordinary passage in <span class="ital">Test. of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, Dan. vi. 1, 2 which runs, “And now, fear the Lord, my children, and beware of Satan and his spirits. Draw near unto God and to the angel that intercedeth for you, for he is a mediator between God and man” (the latter part here is not a Christian interpolation).—<span class="greekheb">καθαρίσατε χεῖρας</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm" title="He that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.">Psalm 24:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀθῷος χερσὶ καὶ καθαρὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ</span> …; in Is. <a href="/james/1-16.htm" title="Do not err, my beloved brothers.">Jam 1:16</a> we have, <span class="greekheb">λούσασθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθαροὶ γένεσθε</span>, and in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-10.htm" title="Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness.">Sir 38:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστησον πλημμελίαν καὶ εὔθυνον χεῖρας</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας καθάρισον καρδίαν</span>. In each case it is a metaphorical use of language which otherwise expressed the literal ritual washing; the former, taken from the latter, was in use at least as early as exilic times.—<span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοί</span>: the close connection with this word and the <span class="greekheb">δίψυχοι</span> which follows almost immediately recalls the language in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-9.htm" title="Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double tongue.">Sir 5:9</a>, … <span class="greekheb">οὕτως ὁ ἁμαρτωλὸς ὁ δίγλωσσος</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἁγνίσατε καρδίας</span>: the thought of these, as well as of the preceding words, is an adaptation of Psalms 72 (73) 13, <span class="greekheb">Ἄρα ματαίως ἐδικαίωσα τὴν καρδίαν μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐνιψάμην ἐν ἀθῴοις τὰς χεῖράς μου</span>. The verb <span class="greekheb">ἁγνίζω</span> (<span class="greekheb">התקדשׁ</span>) means originally to sanctify oneself preparatory to appearing before the Lord by separating oneself from everything that might cause uncleanness; the idea of separating oneself is still present in the passage before us, because mourning implied temporary withdrawal from the world and its doings.

The Call to Repentance<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you</span>] The “nearness to God,” to which the promise is attached, is primarily that which is involved in all true and earnest prayer, but it should not be forgotten that it includes also the approximation of character and life. We are to walk with God as Enoch walked (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm" title="And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.">Genesis 5:24</a>). The former sense is prominent in the LXX. use of the verb employed by St James, as in <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm" title="Therefore turn you to your God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on your God continually.">Hosea 12:6</a>, where in the English we have “<span class="ital">wait on</span> thy God continually,” and <a href="/psalms/119-169.htm" title="Let my cry come near before you, O LORD: give me understanding according to your word.">Psalm 119:169</a>. An illustration of its meaning in the second clause is found in <a href="/job/19-21.htm" title="Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.">Job 19:21</a>, where it answers to the English “have pity on me.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Cleanse your hands, ye sinners</span> …] The words contrast, with an implied reference to our Lord’s teaching in <a href="/context/matthew/15-1.htm" title="Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,...">Matthew 15:1-9</a>, the true cleanness of hands, which consists in abstinence from the evil that defiles (<a href="/psalms/24-4.htm" title="He that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.">Psalm 24:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1 Timothy 2:8</a>), with the merely ceremonial cleanness on which the Pharisees laid stress. Comp. Ch. <a href="/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">purify your hearts</span> …] The verb implies the same kind of purity as the adjective used in Ch. <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>, primarily, that is, <span class="ital">chastity</span> of heart and life. It has here a special emphasis as contrasted with the “adulteresses” in <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>, and with the special aspect of the “double-mindedness” which that word implied.
