The apostle does not mean that these very words should always be used by us, when we speak of our purposes respecting futurity; but that, on such occasions, the sentiment which these words express should always be present to our minds.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-17 Our lips must be governed by the law of kindness, as well as truth and justice. Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is to speak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great a restraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; let us not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule to those about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of the Lord. Go to now, is a call to any one to consider his conduct as being wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out of their plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God's blessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projects for futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour being scattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all the prosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for ever must be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We are always to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with cares and contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, and all we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish, and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; it will bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end. Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well as commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect to meditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit gross outward vices against light!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go to now - The apostle here introduces a new subject, and refers to another fault which was doubtless prevalent among them, as it is everywhere, that of a presumptuous confidence respecting the future, or of forming plans stretching into the future, without any proper sense of the uncertainty of life, and of our absolute dependence on God. The phrase "go to now," (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;  age nun,) is a phrase designed to arrest attention, as if there were something that demanded their notice, and especially, as in this case, with the implied thought that that to which the attention is called is wrong. See <a href="/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1</a>. Compare <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>.<p>Ye that say - You that form your plans in this manner or that speak thus confidently of what you will do in the future. The word say here probably refers to what was in their thoughts, rather than to what was openly expressed.<p>Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city - That is, they say this without any proper sense of the uncertainty of life, and of their absolute dependence on God.<p>And continue there a year - Fixing a definite time; designating the exact period during which they would remain, and when they would leave, without any reference to the will of God. The apostle undoubtedly means to refer here to this as a mere specimen of what he would reprove. It cannot be supposed that he refers to this single case alone as wrong. All plans are wrong that are formed in the same spirit. "The practice to which the apostle here alludes," says the editor of the Pictorial Bible, "is very common in the East to this day, among a very respectable and intelligent class of merchants. They convey the products of one place to some distant city, where they remain until they have disposed of their own goods and have purchased others suitable for another distant market; and thus the operation is repeated, until, after a number of years, the trader is enabled to return prosperously to his home. Or again, a shopkeeper or a merchant takes only the first step in this process - conveying to a distant town, where the best purchases of his own line are to be made, such goods as are likely to realise a profit, and returning, without any farther stop, with a stock for his own concern. These operations are seldom very rapid, as the adventurer likes to wait opportunities for making advantageous bargains; and sometimes opens a shop in the place to which he comes, to sell by retail the goods which he has bought." The practice is common in India. See Roberts" Oriental Illustrations.<p>And buy and sell, and get gain - It is not improbable that there is an allusion here to the commercial habits of the Jews at the time when the apostle wrote. Many of them were engaged in foreign traffic, and for this purpose made long journeys to distant trading cities, as Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, etc. - Bloomfield. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The apostle passes from exposing the sin of detraction, and rash judgment, to inveigh against those of presumption and self-confidence; and the phrase, "go to now", is a note of transition, as well as of attention, and contains the form of a solemn and grave address to persons, who either think within themselves, or vocally express, the following words, or the like unto them: <p>today, or tomorrow, we will go into such a city; in such a country, a place of great trade and merchandise; as Tyre then was in Phoenicia, Thessalonica in Macedonia, Ephesus in Asia, and others: some render this as an imperative, or as an exhortation, "let us go", which does not alter the sense. <p>And continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain; as is customary for merchants to do; nor does the apostle design by this to condemn merchandise, and the lawful practice of buying and selling, and getting gain; but that men should not resolve upon those things without consulting God, and attending to his will, and subjecting themselves to it; and without considering the uncertainty and frailty of human life; as well as should not promise and assure themselves of success, of getting gain and riches, as if those things were in their own power, and had no dependence upon the providence and blessing of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</span><p>(8) The other fault is this: That men do so confidently determine on these and those matters and businesses, as though every moment of their life did not depend on God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">Jam 4:13</a>. The apostrophe commencing with this verse, and continued until chap. <a href="/james/5-6.htm" title="You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.">Jam 5:6</a>, has a character plainly distinguished from other portions of the Epistle—(1) by <span class="greekheb">ἄγε νῦν</span> repeated; (2) those addressed are neither directly designated as <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>, as is elsewhere the case with James (with the single exception of chap. <a href="/james/4-1.htm" title="From where come wars and fights among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?">Jam 4:1</a> ff.), nor are yet characterized as members of the Christian church; (3) only their forgetfulness of God is described, and their judgment is announced without any call being added to desist from their practice and be converted; so that this apostrophe contains not the slightest exhortation to repentance, as is the case with those addressed in <a href="/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">Jam 4:8</a> as <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοί</span> and <span class="greekheb">δίψυχοι</span>. All this is a sufficient proof that James has in view, as Oecumenius, Bede, Semler, Pott, Hottinger, and others have correctly remarked (differently Gebser, Schneckenburger, de Wette, Wiesinger; Theile considers that Jewish Christians and Jews are here addressed), not so much the members of the church, as rather <span class="ital">the rich</span> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ πλούσιοι</span>, <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>), of whom it is already said in chap. <a href="/context/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?...">Jam 2:6-7</a>, that they oppress the Christians and blaspheme the name of Christ, and who are already, in chap. <a href="/james/1-10.htm" title="But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.">Jam 1:10</a>, opposed to “the brother of low degree.” The severe language against them in an Epistle directed to Christians is sufficiently explained from the fact that, with many among them, as follows from <a href="/james/4-1.htm" title="From where come wars and fights among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?">Jam 4:1</a> ff., the same forgetfulness of God had gained ground. Also the first section (<a href="/context/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:...">Jam 4:13-17</a>) is of such a nature that the fault therein expressed affected many of the readers not less than the arrogant Jews.[207] In this section, those addressed are at first characterized only according to their presumptuous security in their striving after earthly gain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΕ ΝῦΝ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἌΓΕ</span></span></span>, occurring in the N.

T. 649]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>] serves not only for strengthening (de Wette, Wiesinger), but likewise for connection with what goes before. As in what follows there is no summons to <span class="ital">do</span> anything, some expositors suppose that <span class="greekheb">ἄγε νῦν</span> is designed only to excite attention; Grotius: jam ego ad vos; so also Pott, Theile: age, audite vos. Others supply a thought; thus Schulthess: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Πῶς ΠΟΙΕῖΤΕ</span></span></span>, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΚΑΛῶς ΠΟΙΕῖΤΕ</span></span></span>, and the like. De Wette thinks that the summons to lay aside the fault is indirectly contained in the reproof. Wiesinger suggests <a href="/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">Jam 4:16</a> as the material for the designed imperative clause. It is more correct to assume that James has already here in view the imperative clause in chap. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛΑΎΣΑΤΕ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἘΠῚ ΤΑῖς ΤΑΛΑΙΠΩΡΊΑΙς ὙΜῶΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>,—placed after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΕ ΝῦΝ</span></span></span> again resumed; thus Gebser, Hottinger, Schneckenburger; similarly Lange, according to whom <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΕ ΝῦΝ</span></span></span> “refers to the announcement of the judgment, which comes out quite clear in chap. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>, but is here darkly and menacingly alluded to.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΛΈΓΟΝΤΕς</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">ye who say.</span> <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span> is to be retained in its usual signification; comp. chap. <a href="/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">Jam 2:14</a>.

In <span class="greekheb">καί</span> there lies a greater confidence (Theile), as according to it a definite plan is fixed upon also for the morrow.

Lange’s meaning is unjustified: “that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὔΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> is used for the undefined future subsequent to to-day.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΣΌΜΕΘΑ</span></span></span>] The indicative <span class="ital">we shall journey</span> expresses the certain confidence more strongly than the conjunctive <span class="ital">let us journey;</span> see critical remarks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τήνδε τὴν πόλιν</span>] Luther: <span class="ital">into this and that city.</span> This explanation is also in Winer, p. 146 [E. T. 201], who adduces for it <span class="greekheb">τήνδε τὴν ἡμέραν</span> in Plutarch, <span class="ital">Symp.</span> i. 6. 1; but Al. Buttmann (p. 90 [E. T. 103]), on the other hand, correctly asserts that the pronoun in that passage, as everywhere among Greek authors, has its full demonstrative meaning, and that therefore it must be understood in James in the same sense; thus Schirlitz (p. 222) observes that the pronoun is here used <span class="greekheb">δεικτικῶς</span>; see also Lünemann’s remark in Winer, ed. 7, p. 153; still it is not to be explained, with Schneckenburger: in hanc urbem, quae in conspectu quasi sita est; but, with Theile: certa fingitur, quae vero verie eligi potest. Those introduced as speaking mean each time a definite city; but as this differs with different persons, James could only indicate it in an indefinite manner, and he does so by <span class="ital">the</span> pronoun by which each time a definite city is pointed to; thus into <span class="ital">the</span> city which the traveller had chosen as his aim.

The reading <span class="greekheb">ἕνα</span> fittingly expresses the confidence with which those introduced as speaking measure out their time beforehand, but not “their restless and unsteady conduct” (Lange).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐμπορευσόμεθα καὶ κερδήσομεν</span>] Bengel: <span class="greekheb">καί</span> frequens; polysyndeton exprimit libidinem animi securi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐμπορεύεσθαι</span>] = <span class="ital">to traffic;</span> the final aim is designated by <span class="greekheb">κερδήσομεν</span>. That aim is worldly gain, which, in carnal security, is recognised as certain to be realized, so that it cannot fail. Kern correctly remarks: “Traffic is introduced only <span class="ital">by way of example</span>, as characterizing man’s doings with reference to the <span class="ital">earthly</span> life as contrasted with the life in God.”[209]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[207] Lange agrees with this in essentials, affirming that this section was principally addressed to the Jews; whereby he certainly proceeds from the erroneous supposition that the Epistle was directed to the Jews generally by the hands of the Jewish Christians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[208] Stier correctly: “will spend there a year.” The opinion of Lange, that “<span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> along with a definition of time may likewise have indicated that the time in question is busily employed,” is contradicted by <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[209] Lange indeed assents to this; but he thinks that the apostle, with a prophet’s glance, evidently describes beforehand the fundamental trait of the diabolically excited worldliness of his people, as it afterwards became more and more developed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:...">Jam 4:13-17</a> form an independent section entirely unconnected with what precedes or follows. The section is very interesting as giving a picture of the commercial <span class="ital">Diaspora</span>-Jew. The Jews of the Dispersion had, from the outset, to give up agricultural pursuits; since for the most part they congregated in the cities it was commerce in which they engaged chiefly. A good instance of the <span class="ital">Diaspora</span>-Jew going from city to city occurs in Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, xii. 2–5 (160–185), though the period dealt with is far anterior to that of our Epistle. Egypt was, of course, the greatest centre of attraction, and many wealthy Jews were to be numbered among the large Jewish population of Alexandria; Philo speaks of Jewish shipowners and merchants in this city (<span class="ital">In Flaccum</span>, viii.). When such Jews embraced Christianity there would be, obviously, no reason for them to give up their calling. It must, however, be confessed that both this section and the following read far more naturally as addressed to Jews than to Jewish-Christians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>13–17. Man proposing, God disposing<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Go to now, ye that say</span> …] The warnings pass on to another form of the worldliness of the double-minded; the far-reaching plans for the future such as our Lord had condemned in the parable of the Rich Fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:">Luke 12:16</a>). It is significant that that parable follows in close sequence upon our Lord’s disclaimer of the office of a Judge. The opening formula, “Go to,” which meets us again in ch. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">James 5:1</a>, is peculiar to St James in the New Testament. It appears in the LXX. in <a href="/judges/19-6.htm" title="And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let your heart be merry.">Jdg 19:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-24.htm" title="Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.">2 Kings 4:24</a>. It is obvious that the warning is addressed to Christians as well as Jews, so far as they were infected by the taint of worldliness. The MSS. vary between “to-day <span class="ital">or</span> to-morrow” and “to-day <span class="ital">and</span> to-morrow,” the latter implying the contemplation of a two days’ journey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into such a city</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">into this city</span>, that which was present to the mind of the speaker.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">Jam 4:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄγε νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">come now</span>) The interjection used to excite attention, ch. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>, <span class="ital">ye who say</span>) In plain terms, ye who boast: <a href="/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">Jam 4:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σήμερον ἢ αὔριον</span>, <span class="ital">to-day or to-morrow</span>) One says, <span class="ital">to-day</span>; the same, or some other person, says, <span class="ital">to-morrow</span>, as it suits his convenience; as though he had a free choice. <span class="greekheb">ἢ αὔριον</span>, Beza; and my note in the Gnomon was formerly in accordance with this reading; afterwards, in the course of inquiry, I preferred <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὔριον</span>.[57] See App. Crit.
