Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Submit yourselves therefore to God - That is, in his arrangements for obtaining his favor. Yield to what he has judged necessary for your welfare in the life that is, and your salvation in the life to come. The duty here enjoined is that of entire acquiescence in the arrangements of God, whether in his providence or grace. All these are for our good, and submission to them is required by the spirit of true humility. The object of the command here, and in the succeeding injunctions to particular duties, is to show them how they might obtain the grace which God is willing to bestow, and how they might overcome the evils against which the apostle had been endeavoring to guard them. The true method of doing this is by submitting ourselves in all things to God.<p>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you - While you yield to God in all things, you are to yield to the devil in none. You are to resist and oppose him in whatever way he may approach you, whether by allurements, by flattering promises, by the fascinations of the world, by temptation, or by threats. See <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>. Satan makes his way, and secures his triumphs, rather by art, cunning, deception, and threatenings, than by true courage; and when opposed manfully, he flies. The true way of meeting him is by direct resistance, rather than by argument; by steadfastly refusing to yield in the slightest degree, rather than by a belief that we can either convince him that he is wrong, or can return to virtue when we have gone a certain length in complying with his demands. No one is safe who yields in the least to the suggestions of the tempter; there is no one who is not safe if he does not yield. A man, for example, is always safe from intemperance if he resists all allurements to indulgence in strong drink, and never yields in the slightest degree; no one is certainly safe if he drinks even moderately. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

In Schneckenburger’s explanation: plena obedientia vos Deo committite, ut sitis <span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι Θεοῦ</span>, obedientia is incorrectly emphasized.

It is not a question of subjection either to God or the devil, but rather one of the choice between self-will and God’s will; it is the proud spirit that has to be curbed.—<span class="greekheb">ἀντίστητε δὲ τῷ διαβόλῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ φεύξεται ἀφʼ ὑμῶν</span>: the two ideas contained in these words are very Jewish; in the first place, the withstanding of the devil is represented as being within the competence of <span class="ital">man</span>; the more specifically Christian way of putting the matter is best seen by comparing the words before us with the two following passages: <a href="/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὑπέστρεψαν δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>· <span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια ὑποτάσσεται ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου</span>. And the passage in <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm" title="Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:">1 Peter 5:6</a> ff. which is parallel to the one before us, is prefaced by the words. “Casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He careth for you,” and followed by the words, “And the God of all grace … shall Himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you”. The difference between the Jewish and Christian doctrines of grace and freewill here cannot fail to be observed. It is useless to cite the words, “Be subject unto God,” as indicating divine assistance in withstanding the devil, because the subject of thought in either passage is quite independent; the meaning is not that ability to withstand the devil is the result of being subject to God; but two courses of action are enjoined, in each of which man is represented as able to take the initiative.—In the second place, the representation of Satan (the devil) here is altogether Jewish; the Hebrew root from which “Satan” comes (<span class="greekheb">שׂטן</span>) means “to oppose,” or “to act as an adversary”; the idea is very clearly brought out in <a href="/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>, where the noun is used: <span class="ital">And the Angel of Jahwe placed himself in the way for an adversary</span> (literally “for a Satan”). This is precisely the picture represented in the words before us; the ancient Hebrew idea of something in the way is to some extent present in the Greek <span class="greekheb">ὁ διάβολος</span>, from <span class="greekheb">διαβάλλω</span> “to throw across,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the pathway is impeded (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ephesians/4-27.htm" title="Neither give place to the devil.">Ephesians 4:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a>). Jewish demonology was full of intensely materialistic conceptions; the presence of demons in various guise, or else invisible, was always feared; primarily it was bodily harm that they did; the idea of spiritual evil, as in the passage before us, was later, though both conceptions existed side by side. The words under consideration are possibly an inexact quotation from <span class="ital">Test. of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, Naphth. viii. 4, “If ye work that which is good my children … and the devil shall flee from you”. Knowling quotes an interesting parallel in Hermas, <span class="ital">Mand.</span>, xii. 5, 2, where in connection with the devil it is said, “If ye resist him he will be vanquished, and will flee from you disgraced”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Submit yourselves therefore to God</span>] The forms of the Greek verbs express a somewhat sharper antithesis than the English. God <span class="bld">setteth himself</span> against the proud, therefore, <span class="bld">set yourselves as under</span> God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Resist the devil, and he will flee from you</span>] The rule seems to point to the true field for the exercise of the combative element which enters into man’s nature. Not in strife and bitterness against each other, not in setting themselves against the will of God, but in taking their stand against the Enemy of God and man were the disciples of Christ to shew that they were indeed men. We may, perhaps, trace in the form of the precept an indirect reference to the history of the Temptation in <a href="/context/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil....">Matthew 4:1-11</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/4-7.htm" title="Submit yourselves therefore to God.
