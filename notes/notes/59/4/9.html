And in proof of real conversion there must be the outward lamentation, as well as the inward contrition. Grieve, therefore, with a “godly sorrow not to be repented of” (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.">2Corinthians 7:10</a>)—the remorseful anguish of a Peter, and not a Judas.

Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep - That is, evidently, on account of your sins. The sins to which the apostle refers are those which he had specified in the previous part of the chapter, and which he had spoken of as so evil in their nature, and so dangerous in their tendency. The word rendered "be afflicted" means, properly, to endure toil or hardship; then to endure affliction or distress; and here means, that they were to afflict themselves - that is, they were to feel distressed and sad on account of their transgressions. Compare <a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>. The other words in this clause are those which are expressive of deep grief or sorrow. The language here used shows that the apostle supposed that it was possible that those who had done wrong should voluntarily feel sorrow for it, and that, therefore, it was proper to call upon them to do it.<p>(All who feel true sorrow for sin, do so voluntarily; but it is not intended by this assertion to insinuate that repentance is not the work of the Spirit. He operates on men without destroying their freedom, or doing violence to their will: "in the day of his power they are willing." Nor is it improper to call on men to do that for which they require the Spirit's aid. That aid is not withheld in the hour of need; and everywhere the Bible commands sinners to believe and repent.)<p>Let your laughter be turned to mourning - It would seem that the persons referred to, instead of suitable sorrow and humiliation on account of sin, gave themselves to joyousness, mirth, and revelry. See a similar instance in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12-13</a>. It is often the case, that those for whom the deep sorrows of repentance would be peculiarly appropriate, give themselves to mirth and vanity. The apostle here says that such mirth did not become them. Sorrow, deep and unfeigned, was appropriate on account of their sins, and the sound of laughter and of revelry should be changed to notes of lamentation. To how many of the assemblies of the vain, the gay, and the dissipated, might the exhortation in this passage with propriety be now addressed!<p>Your joy to heaviness - The word here rendered heaviness occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means dejection, sorrow. It is not gloom, melancholy, or moroseness, but it is sorrow on account of sin. God has so made us that we should feel sorrow when we are conscious that we have done wrong, and it is appropriate that we should do so. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The two last verbs are frequently joined together, as in <a href="/mark/16-10.htm" title="And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.">Mark 16:10</a>; <a href="/luke/6-25.htm" title="Woe to you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.">Luke 6:25</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-15.htm" title="The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,">Revelation 18:15</a>. The words are an emphatic call to repentance, and the blessedness which follows on repentance. Here, as so often in the Epistle, we trace the direct influence of the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-4.htm" title="Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.">Matthew 5:4</a>). The contrast between the “laughter” and the “mourning” in the clause that follows, makes the connexion all but absolutely certain. The “laughter” is that of the careless, selfish, luxurious rejoicing of the world, the “sport” of the fool in <a href="/proverbs/10-23.htm" title="It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding has wisdom.">Proverbs 10:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your joy to heaviness</span>] The Greek for the latter word expresses literally the downcast look of sorrow, and is as old in this sense as Homer,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Joy to thy foes, but <span class="ital">heavy shame</span> to thee.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Iliad</span> iii. 51.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It exactly describes the attitude of the publican, who would not “lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven” (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/4-9.htm" title="Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.">Jam 4:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταλαιπωρήσατε</span>, <span class="ital">be afflicted</span>) that ye may be weaned and estranged from the world.
