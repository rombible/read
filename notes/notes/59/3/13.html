It may be proper to observe, that about this time the Jews, from their intemperate zeal for the law of Moses, raised seditions in Judea and elsewhere, which were the occasion of many crimes and of much bloodshed. And as the apostle expected that this epistle would fall into the hands of some of the unconverted Jews, and indeed, perhaps, partly addressed them in it, he probably might refer to these tumults and disorders in this verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-18 These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise, and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? - This is spoken with reference to the work of public teaching; and the meaning of the apostle is, that if there were such persons among them, they should be selected for that office. The characteristics here stated as necessary qualifications, are wisdom and knowledge. Those, it would seem, on which reliance had been placed, were chiefly those which were connected with a ready elocution, or the mere faculty of speaking. The apostle had stated the dangers which would follow if reliance were placed on that alone, and he now says that something more is necessary, that the main qualifications for the office are wisdom and knowledge. No mere power of speaking, however eloquent it might be, was a sufficient qualification. The primary things to be sought in reference to that office were wisdom and knowledge, and they who were endowed with these things should be selected for public instructors.<p>Let him show out of a good conversation - From a correct and consistent life and deportment. On the meaning of the word "conversation," see the notes at <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. The meaning here is, that there should be an upright life, and that this should be the basis in forming the judgment in appointing persons to fill stations of importance, and especially in the office of teaching in the church.<p>His works - His acts of uprightness and piety. He should be a man of a holy life.<p>With meekness of wisdom - With a wise and prudent gentleness of life; not in a noisy, arrogant, and boastful manner. True wisdom is always meek, mild, gentle; and that is the wisdom which is needful, if men would become public teachers. It is remarkable that the truly wise man is always characterized by a calm spirit, a mild and placid demeanor, and by a gentle, though firm, enunciation of his sentiments. A noisy, boisterous, and stormy declaimer we never select as a safe counsellor. He may accomplish much in his way by his bold eloquence of manner, but we do not put him in places where we need far-reaching thought, or where we expect the exercise of profound philosophical views. In an eminent degree, the ministry of the gospel should be characterized by a calm, gentle, and thoughtful wisdom - a wisdom which shines in all the actions of the life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The apostle having shown the disease of the tongue, comes now to remove the cause, viz. men’s opinion of their own wisdom; (they censure others, because they take themselves to be wiser than others); and to point out the remedy, godly meekness, which is the truest wisdom. By wisdom and knoledge the same thing may be meant; or if they be taken for several things, (as sometimes there may be great knoledge where there is but little wisdom), yet these masterly censors he speaks of pretended to both, and were so rigid toward others because so well conceited of themselves: the sense is: You pretend to be wise and knowing, but if you would approve yourselves as such indeed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">show out of a good conversation, </span>& c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His works; </span> let him show as the testimony of his wisdom, not his words in hard censures, but his works, viz. good ones, and those not done now and then, or on the by, but in the constant course and tenor of his life; or show his works to be good, by their being not casual, but constant, and his ordinary practice in his whole conversation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With meekness of wisdom; </span> i.e. meek and gentle wisdom, which can bear, and answer, and teach, and admonish, and rebuke mildly and sweetly, with long-suffering, as well as doctrine, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.">2 Timothy 4:2</a></span>: and then it notes the quality of this wisdom, or such meekness as proceeds from wisdom, or is joined with it, there being some which is foolish, affected, carnal, viz. that which is opposed to zeal; whereas true meekness is only opposed to fierceness and rashness: and thus it notes the cause of meekness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is a wise man. Meaning, not in things natural and civil, or merely moral, but in things spiritual: and he is a wise man, who is both wise to do good, and wise unto salvation; who has learned to know his own ignorance, folly, and stupidity; for the first lesson in the school of spiritual wisdom is for a man to know that he is a fool: and he is a wise man who considers his latter end, thinks of a future state, and what will become of him in another world; and who builds his faith and hope of eternal salvation on the sure and only foundation, the rock Christ Jesus; and who takes up a profession of religion upon principles of grace, and with views to the glory of God, and, upon mature deliberation, reckoning the cost, and what he must expect to meet with; and which he holds fast, without wavering, and yet does not depend upon it; and who walks circumspectly, and with wisdom, towards them that are without; and who observes both providences and promises, for the encouragement of his faith; and keeps looking to the mark for the prize, preferring heavenly things to earthly ones. <p>And endued with knowledge amongst you? as he is, who is endued with the knowledge of himself; of the impurity of his nature, and the plague of his heart; and of his impotency and inability to do any thing that is spiritually good of himself; and of the imperfection and insufficiency of his righteousness to justify him before God; and of his lost state and condition by nature, how deserving of the wrath of God, and obnoxious to the curses of the law; and how miserable he must be without the grace of God and righteousness of Christ: and who is also endued with the knowledge of Christ, so as to see a fulness, suitableness, and ability in him as a Saviour; so as to love him, approve of him, as such, and trust in him; which knowledge is always practical and soul humbling; and the least degree of it saving; and though it is imperfect, it is growing, and will at last come to perfection: now such a man is a Gnostic, in the best sense; for this question is put with a view to the Gnostics of those times, who valued themselves upon their knowledge, and despised practical religion and godliness: hence it follows, <p>let him show out of a good conversation his works, with meekness of wisdom; such an one ought to perform good works, and he will perform them; and it is right in him to show them forth, that they may be a means of others glorifying God upon the sight of them; and that they may be evidences of the truth of faith in themselves to others; and that they may be for the imitation of others; and that they may put to silence, and stop the mouths of false accusers, and adorn the Gospel, and recommend religion: and these should be shown forth "out of a good conversation"; not in a single act or two, but in a series and course of living; which may be said to be good, when it is ordered aright, according to the word of God, and is honest among the Gentiles, and upright and holy; and is as becomes the Gospel of Christ, and is worthy of the calling of God to grace and glory; and when it is influenced by the grace of God: and the works shown out of it, and in it, are done in faith, from love in the strength of Christ, and are directed to the glory of God: and all this should be "with meekness of wisdom"; in a wise and humble manner, without trusting to, and depending upon, such works for justification and salvation; and without glorying in them, and boasting of them; acknowledging the deficiency and imperfection of them, and his own weakness in the performance of them; and ascribing them to the power and grace of God, by the assistance of which they are performed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Who <i>is</i> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span><p>(9) The eighth part, which goes with the former concerning meekness of mind, against which he sets envy and a contentious mind: in the beginning he shuts the mouth of the main fountain of all these mischiefs, that is, a false persuasion of wisdom, whereas nonetheless there is no true wisdom, but that which is heavenly, and shapes our minds to all types of true discipline and modesty.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">Jam 3:13</a>. With this verse apparently begins a new section, which, however, stands in close connection with the warning in <a href="/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">Jam 3:1</a>, whilst the true wisdom is here contrasted with the false wisdom of which the readers boasted, and by which they considered themselves qualified to teach. Also here in the words: <span class="greekheb">τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, the chief point is again placed at the beginning. These words are usually understood as a direct question (Tischendorf and Winer, p. 152 [E. T. 211]); on the other hand, Lachmann has only placed a comma after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, which is approved by Al. Buttmann (p. 217 [E. T. 252]); an <span class="ital">inversio structurae</span> then here takes place; whilst “the direct interrogative form, owing to the construction which follows, passed naturally over into the meaning of the kindred relative clause.” Certainly in the N. T. the direct question is frequently used instead of the indirect, indeed instead of the relative pronoun; also in the usual meaning “the disruption of the clauses, as well as the asyndetic transition to <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span> without any subject,” is surprising. But, on the other hand, the discourse by the direct question evidently gains in liveliness, as it is, moreover, peculiar to the diction of James; see, however, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/6-34.htm" title="Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise.">Sir 6:34</a>, to which Schneckenburger appeals in support of the incorrect opinion that <span class="greekheb">τις</span> is here the indefinite pronoun.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων</span>] The same combination of these two words is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm" title="Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>, LXX., as the translation of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">חָכָם וְנָבוֹן</span>; comp. also <a href="/hosea/14-9.htm" title="Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.">Hosea 14:9</a>. If James here considered these two synonymous ideas as different, <span class="greekheb">σοφός</span> is to be referred to the general, and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστήμων</span> to the particular. Wiesinger refers the former to the intelligence, and the latter to the practical insight into the correct judgment of any given case; others differently.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That whosoever is actually wise is to show it by action, is the chief thought of the following sentence. The construction of <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> and the object following on it, reminds us of chap. <a href="/james/2-18.htm" title="Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.">Jam 2:18</a> : <span class="greekheb">δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν</span>, but the relation is not entirely the same. In that passage <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> is the invisible, which is to manifest itself as the visible by <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span>; but here both <span class="greekheb">ἡ καλὴ ἀναστροφή</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span> are visible; the former is the general, the latter is the particular, which as individual special manifestations proceed from it. The verb <span class="greekheb">δείκνυμι</span> means here, as there, not to prove or demonstrate, but to show. The addition <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι</span>—which is to be connected neither with <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span> nor with <span class="greekheb">τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς</span>, forming one idea, but belongs to <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span>, more exactly defined by <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>—has the principal accent, as <span class="greekheb">πραΰτης σοφίας</span>, i.e. the meekness springing from wisdom, and therefore peculiar to it (opposite of <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>), is the necessary condition under which the showing forth of works out of a good conversation alone is possible. The mode in which the individual ideas of the sentence are united together is certainly somewhat surprising, but it is explainable from the fact that James placed together all the points which occurred to him as briefly as possible. James might have put <span class="greekheb">τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ</span> as the object belonging to <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span>; but instead of this he puts <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span>, in conformity with the importance which works have to him, in which as faith (<a href="/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">Jam 2:10</a>) so also wisdom manifests itself. He then makes the idea <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> to follow in the adverbial addition <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι σοφίας</span>. The sentence might also be divided by a point after <span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφῆς</span>; then the first clause would mean: let him show it out of a good conversation; and the second clause might either be taken as an addition dependent on <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span> (so Neander: “works performed in meekness suitable to wisdom”), or a verb would have to be supplied. However, the detachment of the second clause decides against this construction. <span class="greekheb">ὡς σοφοῦ</span> is not, with Schneckenburger, Theile, Wiesinger, to be supplied to <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, as the reference to wisdom is contained in the additional clause; but also <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> must not be referred to <span class="greekheb">σοφός</span> (his works, that is, of the wise man), but it refers to the subject contained in <span class="greekheb">δειξάτω</span> (thus Lange and Brückner). The whole idea <span class="greekheb">πραΰτης σοφίας</span> is neither to be resolved into <span class="greekheb">πραεῖα σοφία</span> (Beza, Grotius, Baumgarten, Semler, Gebser, Hottinger, Schneckenburger), nor into <span class="greekheb">πραΰτης σοφή</span> (Laurentius), but to be explained: “the meekness which is proper to wisdom, and proceeds from it” (Wiesinger), or “in which <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> evidences itself” (Lange).[182] With the emphasis on <span class="greekheb">πραΰτης</span> James passes on to <span class="greekheb">βραδὺς εἰς ὀργήν</span> (chap. <a href="/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>), of which what follows is a further explication.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[182] Luther inaccurately translates the passage: “who shows with his good conversation his works in meekness <span class="ital">and</span> wisdom.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">Jam 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν</span>: The writer’s appeal to the self-respect of his hearers. <span class="greekheb">σοφός</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστήμων</span> (the latter does not occur elsewhere in the N.T.) are connected in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>, where in reference to judges it is said, <span class="greekheb">δότε αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετούς</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm" title="Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm" title="Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!">Isaiah 5:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφή</span> is literally a “turning back,” but later connotes “manner of life”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> a quotation from an inscription from Pergamos (belonging to the second century B.C.) given by Deissmann, in which it is said concerning one of the royal officials: <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν κα</span>[<span class="greekheb">ιροῖς ἀμέμπτως καὶ ἀδ</span>]<span class="greekheb">εῶς ἀναστρεφόμενος</span> (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 83).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι σοφίας</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> with the whole of this verse <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/3-17.htm" title="My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved....">Sir 3:17-18</a>, <span class="greekheb">Τέκνον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πρᾳύτητι τὰ ἔργα σου διέξαγε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπου δεκτοῦ ἀγαπηθήσῃ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅσῳ μέγας εἶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοσούτῳ ταπεινοῦ σεαυτόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔναντι Κυρίου εὑρήσεις χάριν</span>.

Probably no very nice distinction was intended by the writer. It is somewhat difficult to fix the precise sense of &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, since there is no uniformity in its usage in the New Testament. In classical Greek it primarily means skilled in a handicraft or art. Thence it runs into the sense of clever, in matters of common life, worldly wise. Then, in the hands of the philosophers, it acquires the sense of learned in the sciences; and, ironically, abstruse, subtle, obscure, like the English cunning, which originally meant knowing or skilful, and is often used in that sense in the English Bible (see <a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16</a>).<p>In the New Testament &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; is used - 1. In the original classical sense, skilled in handicraft (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). 2. Accomplished in letters, learned (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>, <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>). So of the Jewish theologians and doctors (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), and of Christian teachers (<a href="/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a>). 3. In a practical sense, of the practice of the law of piety and honesty; so <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>, where it is joined with walking circumspectly, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a>, where it is represented as the quality adapted to adjust differences in the church. 4. In the higher, philosophical sense, of devising the best counsels and employing the best means to carry them out. So of God, <a href="/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>; Jde 1:25; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>. In this passage the word appears to be used in the sense of 3: practical wisdom in pious living.<p>&#x395;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; occurs only here in the New Testament. In classical Greek it is often used like &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, in the sense of skilled, versed; and by the philosophers in the higher sense of scientifically versed, in which sense it is opposed by Plato to &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, a mere conjecturer. In this passage &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; would seem to be the broader, more general, and perhaps more dignified term of the two, as denoting the habit or quality, while &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; indicates the special development and intelligent application of the quality to particular things. The Rev., wise and understanding, gives the distinction, on the whole, as nearly as is necessary.<p>Conversation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15</a>.<p>Meekness of wisdom<p>On meekness, see on <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>.
