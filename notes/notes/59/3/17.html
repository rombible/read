Thus, “in this beautiful passage, St. James describes the excellent nature of that temper which is recommended by the Christian religion, and the happy effects which it produces. It is the highest wisdom; it comes from God, and makes those who receive it holy and happy. All the apostles, except Paul, were illiterate men; but, according to their Master’s promise, they had, by the inspiration of the Spirit, a wisdom and eloquence given them, far exceeding what they could have acquired by the deepest erudition. Of the fulfilment of Christ’s promise, the epistle of James is a striking proof. Search all heathen antiquity, and see whether it can produce any sentiments more noble, or more simply and beautifully expressed, than those contained in this chapter, and indeed throughout the whole epistle.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-18 These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise, and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the wisdom that is from above - Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-7</a>. The wisdom which has a heavenly origin, or which is from God. The man who is characterised by that wisdom will be pure, peaceable, etc. This does not refer to the doctrines of religion, but to its spirit.<p>Is first pure - That is, the first effect of it on the mind is to make it pure. The influence on the man is to make him upright, sincere, candid, holy. The word here used (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  hagne&#772;) is that which would be applied to one who is innocent, or flee from crime or blame. Compare <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>; where the word is rendered, as here, "pure"; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>; where it is rendered clear, (in this matter); <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-2.htm">1 Peter 3:2</a>, where it is rendered chaste. The meaning here is, that the first and immediate effect of religion is not on the intellect, to make it more enlightened; or on the imagination, to make it more discursive and brilliant; or on the memory and judgment, to make them clearer and stronger; but it is to purify the heart, to make the man upright, inoffensive, and good. This passage should not be applied, as it often is, to the doctrines of religion, as if it were the first duty of a church to keep itself free from errors in doctrine, and that this ought to be sought even in preference to the maintenance of peace - as if it meant that in doctrine a church should be "first pure, then peaceable;" but it should be applied to the individual consciences of men, as showing the effect of religion on the heart and life.<p>The first thing which it produces is to make the man himself pure and good; then follows the train of blessings which the apostle enumerates as flowing from that. It is true that a church should be pure in doctrinal belief, but that is not the truth taught here. It is not true that the scripture teaches, here or elsewhere, that purity of doctrine is to be preferred to a peaceful spirit; or that it always leads to a peaceful spirit; or that it is proper for professed Christians and Christian ministers to sacrifice, as is often done, a peaceful spirit, in an attempt to preserve purity of doctrine. Most of the persecutions in the church have grown out of this maxim. This led to the establishment of the Inquisition; this kindled the fires of Smithfield; this inspirited Laud and his friends; this has been the origin of no small part of the schisms in the church. A pure spirit is the best promoter of peace, and will do more than anything else to secure the prevalence of truth.<p>(It is but too true that much unseemly strife has had the aegis of this text thrown over it. The "wrath of man" accounts itself zeal for God, and strange fire usurps the place of the true fire of the sanctuary. Yet the author's statement here seems somewhat overcharged; possibly his own personal history may have contributed a little to this result. Although the Greek word &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  hagne&#772;, here qualifying the &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  sophia, or wisdom, refers to purity of heart, still it remains true that a pure heart will never relinquish its hold on God's truth for the sake of a peace that at such a price would be too dearly purchased. A pure heart cannot but be faithful to the truth; it could not otherwise be pure, provided conscientiousness and love of truth form any part of moral purity. Surely, then, an individual solicited to yield up what he believed to be truth, or what were cherished convictions, might properly assign this text as a reason why he could not, and ought not; and if an individual might, why not any number associated into a church?<p>It is true the Scriptures do not teach that "doctrinal purity" is to be preferred to a "peaceful spirit." However pure a man's doctrine may be, if he has not the peaceful spirit he is none of Christ's. But the common view of this passage is not chargeable with any such absurdity. It supposes only that there may be circumstances in which the spirit of peace, though possessed, cannot be exercised, except in meek submission to wrong for conscience sake; never can it turn traitor to truth, or make any compromise with error. The "first" of the apostle does not indicate even preference of the pure spirit to the peaceful spirit, but only the order in which they are to be exercised. There must be no attempts to reach peace by overleaping purity. The maxim that a pure heart ought not to sacrifice truth on any consideration whatever, never gave rise to persecution: it has made many martyrs, but never one persecutor; it has pined in the dungeon, but never immured any there; it has burned amid the flames, but never lighted the faggot; it has ascended scaffolds, but never erected them; it has preserved and bequeathed civil and religious liberty, but never assaulted them; it is a divine principle - the principle by which Christianity became strong, and will ultimately command the homage of the world. There is another principle, with which this has no brotherhood, that denies the right of private judgment, and enforces uniformity by the sword: its progeny are inquisitors, and Lauds and Sharpes; and let it have the credit of its own offspring.)<p>Then peaceable - The effect of true religion - the wisdom which is from above - will be to dispose a man to live in peace with all others. See the <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> note; <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>.<p>Gentle - Mild, inoffensive, clement. The word here used (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2;  epieike&#772;s) is rendered "moderation" in <a href="/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; patient in <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>; and gentle in <a href="/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, and <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>. It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. Every one has a clear idea of the virtue of gentleness - gentleness of spirit, of deportment, and of manners; and every one can see that that is the appropriate spirit of religion. Compare the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>. It is from this word that we have derived the word "gentleman"; and the effect of true religion is to make everyone, in the proper and best sense of the term, a gentleman. How can a man have evidence that he is a true Christian, who is not such? The highest title which can be given to a man is, that he is a Christian gentleman.<p>And easy to be entreated - The word here used does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means easily persuaded, compliant. Of course, this refers only to cases where it is right and proper to be easily persuaded and complying. It cannot refer to things which are in themselves wrong. The sense is, that he who is under the influence of the wisdom which is from above, is not a stiff, stern, obstinate, unyielding man. He does not take a position, and then hold it whether right or wrong; he is not a man on whom no arguments or persuasions can have any influence. He is not one who cannot be affected by any appeals which may be made to him on the grounds of patriotism, justice, or benevolence; but is one who is ready to yield when truth requires him to do it, and who is willing to sacrifice his own convenience for the good of others. See this illustrated in the case of the apostle Paul, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</a>. Compare the notes at that passage.<p>Full of mercy - Merciful; disposed to show compassion to others. This is one of the results of the wisdom that is from above, for it makes us like God, the "Father of mercies." See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>.<p>And good fruits - The fruits of good living; just, benevolent, and kind actions. <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a> note; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a> note. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>.<p>Without partiality - Margin, "or wrangling." The word here used (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  adiakritos) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, "not to be distinguished." Here it may mean either of the following things:<p>(a) not open to distinction or doubt; that is, unambiguous, so that there shall be no doubt about its origin or nature;<p>(b) making no distinction, that is, in the treatment of others, or impartial towards them; or,<p>(c) without strife, from &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  diakrino&#772;, to contend.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. first pure&#8212;literally, "chaste," "sanctified": pure from all that is "earthly, sensual (animal), devilish" (Jas 3:15). This is put, "first of all," before "peaceable" because there is an unholy peace with the world which makes no distinction between clean and unclean. Compare "undefiled" and "unspotted from the world," Jas 1:27; 4:4, 8, "purify &#8230; hearts"; 1Pe 1:22, "purified &#8230; souls" (the same Greek). Ministers must not preach before a purifying change of heart, "Peace," where there is no peace. Seven (the perfect number) characteristic peculiarities of true wisdom are enumerated. Purity or sanctity is put first because it has respect both to God and to ourselves; the six that follow regard our fellow men. Our first concern is to have in ourselves sanctity; our second, to be at peace with men.<p>gentle&#8212;"forbearing"; making allowances for others; lenient towards neighbors, as to the DUTIES they owe us.<p>easy to be entreated&#8212;literally, "easily persuaded," tractable; not harsh as to a neighbor's FAULTS.<p>full of mercy&#8212;as to a neighbor's MISERIES.<p>good fruits&#8212;contrasted with "every evil work," Jas 3:16.<p>without partiality&#8212;recurring to the warning against partial "respect to persons," Jas 2:1, 4, 9. Alford translates as the Greek is translated, Jas 1:6, "wavering," "without doubting." But thus there would be an epithet referring to one's self inserted amidst those referring to one's conduct towards others. English Version is therefore better.<p>without hypocrisy&#8212;Not as Alford explains from Jas 1:22, 26, "Without deceiving yourselves" with the name without the reality of religion. For it must refer, like the rest of the six epithets, to our relations to others; our peaceableness and mercy towards others must be "without dissimulation."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But the wisdom that is from above; </span> true wisdom, which is of God, opposed to that which <span class="ital">descendeth not from above, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is first pure; </span> either excluding mixture, and then it is opposed to hypocritical; or rather excluding filthiness, and then it is opposed to <span class="ital">sensual, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a></span>, and implies freedom from the defilement of sin and error, it being the property of true wisdom to make men adhere both to truth and holiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then peaceable; </span> disposeth men to peace, both as to the making and keeping it, in opposition to strife and contention, which is the fruit of the earthly wisdom.

It is not meant, i. e. that purity is an earlier stage of moral growth in wisdom than peace, but that it is its foremost attribute. The “purity” indicated is especially that of chastity of flesh and spirit (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/titus/2-5.htm" title="To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.">Titus 2:5</a>), and as such is contrasted with the “sensual” character of the false wisdom. Here again we have the tone of one who has learnt from the Masters of those who know, among the teachers of his own people, that wisdom will not “dwell in the body that is subject unto sin” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/1-4.htm" title="For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.">Wis 1:4</a>). The sequence which places “peaceful” after “pure” has its counterpart in the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/context/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God....">Matthew 5:8-9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gentle, and easy to be intreated</span>] The word for “gentle” means literally, <span class="bld">forbearing</span>. It describes, as in Aristotle (<span class="ital">Eth.</span> 10:6), the temper that does not press its rights, that is content to suffer wrong (comp. <a href="/philippians/4-5.htm" title="Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.">Php 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1 Timothy 3:3</a>). The second adjective is used by classical writers, both in a passive sense as here, and active, (1) as meaning “persuasive,” “winning its way by gentleness,” or (2) as “obedient.” Our choice between the three meanings must depend on our view of what is most likely to have been the sequence of St James’s thoughts. On the whole, the second seems to me to have the most to commend it. True wisdom shews itself, St James seems to say, in that subtle yet gentle power to persuade and win, which we all feel when we come in contact with one who is clearly not fighting for his own rights, but for the cause of Truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">full of mercy and good fruits</span>] The train of thought is carried on. Wisdom is suasive because she is compassionate. In dealing with the froward she is stirred, not by anger, but by pity, and she overflows, not with “every vile deed,” but with the good fruits of kindly acts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without partiality</span>] Here again we have a Greek word which admits of more than one sense. The English version gives it an active sense, as describing the temper which does not distinguish wrongly, which is no respecter of persons. The sense in which the verb, from which the adjective is formed, is used in ch. <a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>, <a href="/james/2-4.htm" title="Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?">James 2:4</a>, is, however, that of “doubting,” or “wavering;” and it seems, therefore, probable that St James means to describe true wisdom as free from the tendency which he thus condemns. That freedom goes naturally with the freedom from unreality which the next word expresses. <span class="ital">Without vacillation</span> is the condition of “<span class="ital">without hypocrisy</span>.” Where the purpose is single there is no risk of a simulated piety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">Jam 3:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρῶτον μὲν ἁγνή ἐστιν</span>, <span class="ital">first of all is pure</span>) Pure from earthly, animal, and devilish defilements.
