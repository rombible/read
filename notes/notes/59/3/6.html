for I am tormented in this flame.">Luke 16:24</a>).<p>“Speech is silver; silence, gold.” But even the Christian world will not endure overmuch the godly discipline of silence. Three temptations “to smite with the tongue” are specially powerful of evil: viz., as a relief from passion, as a gratification of spite, as revenge for wrong. The first is experienced by hot tempered folk; the second yielded to by the malicious; the third welcomed by the otherwise weak and defenceless; and all of us at times are in each of these divisions. Then, again, there are the “foolish talkings” (<a href="/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a>), and worse, the jestings at holy things, and misquotations of Scripture: all to be avoided as not becoming saints. If then we would “walk in love” we must curb the tongue; but, better still, strive to cleanse the heart, and so be quite determined that nothing shall go forth but words of meekness and affection. Nay, if we be truly Christ’s, though “reviled” by the unruly tongues of others, we shall, like Him, “revile not again” (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>). And as the whole body is the Lord’s to be sanctified to Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>so particularly must the tongue be kept from “evil-speaking, lying, and slandering,” and used rightly for the service of God. Thus may we truly offer “the calves of our lips” (<a href="/hosea/14-2.htm" title="Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.">Hosea 14:2</a>), more acceptable than the blood of victims slain on a thousand altars, “than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices” (<a href="/mark/12-23.htm" title="In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.">Mark 12:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">James 3:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The tongue is a fire </span>— Which often produces a great conflagration; <span class="ital">a world of iniquity — </span>This is a metaphor of the same kind with <span class="ital">a sea of troubles, a deluge of wickedness. </span>The meaning is, that a great collection of iniquity proceeds from the tongue. Indeed “there is no iniquity which an unbridled tongue is not capable of producing; either by itself, when it curses, rails, teaches false doctrine, and speaks evil of God and man; or by means of others, whom it entices, commands, terrifies, and persuades, to commit murders, adulteries, and every evil work.” <span class="ital">So is the</span> <span class="ital">tongue </span>— Such is the rank and place it holds <span class="ital">among our members, that it defileth the whole body </span>— The whole man, all our members, senses, and faculties. In this, and in what follows, the similitude of the fire and wood is carried on. For as the fire, put among the wood, first spotteth or blackeneth it with its smoke, and then setteth it on fire, so the tongue spotteth or blackeneth, and then <span class="ital">setteth on fire </span>the natural frame, termed here <span class="ital">the course, </span><span class="greekheb">τροχον</span>, <span class="ital">the wheel, of nature </span>— “The wonderful mechanism of the human body, and its power of affecting and of being affected by the soul, is in this passage aptly represented by the wheels of a machine which act on each other. The pernicious influence of the tongue, in first spotting, and then destroying, both the bodies and the souls of men, arises from the language which it frames, whereby it inflames men’s passions to such a degree, that, being no longer under the direction of their reason, those passions push them on to such actions as are destructive both of their bodies and souls.” Some writers, by the <span class="ital">natural wheel, </span>or <span class="ital">course of nature, </span>understand the successive generations of men, one generation going, and another coming, without intermission; according to which interpretation the apostle’s meaning is, that the tongue hath set on fire our forefathers, it inflameth us, and will have the same influence on those who come after us. <span class="ital">And it is set on fire of hell </span>— Put here for the devil; as, by a like metonymy, heaven is put for God. Satan influences the heart, and its wickedness overflows by the tongue, and tends, by its fatal consequences, to produce a very hell upon earth. “The use we ought to make of the doctrine taught in this highly figurative passage is obvious. Being surrounded with such a mass of combustible matter, we should take great care not to send from our tongues the least spark by which it may be kindled, lest we ourselves, with those whom we set on fire, be consumed in the flames which we raise.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the tongue is a fire - In this sense, that it produces a "blaze," or a great conflagration. It produces a disturbance and an agitation that may be compared with the conflagration often produced by a spark.<p>A world of iniquity - A little world of evil in itself. This is a very expressive phrase, and is similar to one which we often employ, as when we speak of a town as being a world in miniature. We mean by it that it is an epitome of the world; that all that there is in the world is represented there on a small scale. So when the tongue is spoken of as being "a world of iniquity," it is meant that all kinds of evil that are in the world are exhibited there in miniature; it seems to concentrate all sorts of iniquity that exist on the earth. And what evil is there which may not be originated or fomented by the tongue? What else is there that might, with so much propriety, be represented as a little world of iniquity? With all the good which it does, who can estimate the amount of evil which it causes? Who can measure the evils which arise from scandal, and slander, and profaneness, and perjury, and falsehood, and blasphemy, and obscenity, and the inculcation of error, by the tongue? Who can gauge the amount of broils, and contentions, and strifes, and wars, and suspicions, and enmities, and alienations among friends and neighbors, which it produces? Who can number the evils produced by the "honeyed" words of the seducer; or by the tongue of the eloquent in the maintenance of error, and the defense of wrong? If all men were dumb, what a portion of the crimes of the world would soon cease! If all men would speak only that which ought to be spoken, what a change would come over the face of human affairs!<p>So is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body - It stains or pollutes the whole body. It occupies a position and relation so important in respect to every part of our moral frame, that there is no portion which is not affected by it. Of the truth of this, no one can have any doubt. There is nothing else pertaining to us as moral and intellectual beings, which exerts such an influence over ourselves as the tongue. A man of pure conversation is understood and felt to be pure in every respect; but who has any confidence in the virtue of the blasphemer, or the man of obscene lips, or the calumniator and slanderer? We always regard such a man as corrupt to the core.<p>And setteth on fire the course of nature - The margin is "the wheel of nature." The Greek word also (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  trochos) means "a wheel," or any thing made for revolving and running. Then it means the course run by a wheel; a circular course or circuit. The word rendered "nature" (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  genesis), means "procreation, birth, nativity;" and therefore the phrase means, literally, the wheel of birth - that is, the wheel which is set in motion at birth, and which runs on through life. - Rob. Lex. sub voce &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  geneseo&#772;s. It may be a matter of doubt whether this refers to successive generations, or to the course of individual life. The more literal sense would be that which refers to an individual; but perhaps the apostle meant to speak in a popular sense, and thought of the affairs of the world as they roll on from age to age, as all enkindled by the tongue, keeping the world in a constant blaze of excitement. Whether applied to an individual life, or to the world at large, every one can see the justice of the comparison. One naturally thinks, when this expression is used, of a chariot driven on with so much speed that its wheels by their rapid motion become self-ignited, and the chariot moves on amidst flames.<p>And it is set on fire of hell - Hell, or Gehenna, is represented as a place where the fires continually burn. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>. The idea here is, that that which causes the tongue to do so much evil derives its origin from hell. Nothing could better characterize much of that which the tongues does, than to say that it has its origin in hell, and has the spirit which reigns there. The very spirit of that world of fire and wickedness - a spirit of falsehood, and slander, and blasphemy, and pollution - seems to inspire the tongue. The image which seems to have been before the mind of the apostle was that of a torch which enkindles and burns everything as it goes along - a torch itself lighted at the fires of hell. One of the most striking descriptions of the woes and curses which there may be in hell, would be to portray the sorrows caused on the earth by the tongue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

It is like to fire, very useful in its place, to warm and comfort; so is the tongue in Christian conversation, and in the ministry of the word; the hearts of God's children burn within them, while they are talking together, and while the Scriptures of truth are opening to them; but as fire should be carefully watched, and kept, so should men take heed to their ways, that they sin not with their tongue, and keep their tongue from evil, and their lips from speaking guile; for as fire kindles and rises up into a flame, so unchaste, angry, and passionate words, stir up the flame of lust, anger, envy, and revenge; and as fire is of a spreading nature, so are lies, scandal, and evil reports vented by the tongue; and as fire devours all that comes in its way, such are the words of an evil tongue; and therefore are called devouring words, <a href="/psalms/52-4.htm">Psalm 52:4</a> they devour the good names of men, and corrupt their good manners, and destroy those who make use of them; and what wood is to fire, and coals to burning coals, that are whisperers, tale bearers, backbiters, and contentious persons to strife, <a href="/proverbs/26-20.htm">Proverbs 26:20</a><p>a world of iniquity; that is, as the world is full of things, and full of sin, for it lies in wickedness, so is the tongue full of iniquity; there is a world of it in it; it abounds with it; it cannot well be said how much sin is in it, and done, or occasioned by it; as blasphemy against God, Father, Son, and Spirit; cursing of men, imprecations on themselves, their souls, and bodies, and on others, with a multitude of profane and dreadful oaths; obscene, filthy, and unchaste words; angry, wrathful, and passionate ones; lies, flatteries, reproaches, backbitings, whisperings, tale bearings, &amp;c. And the Jews say, that he that uses an evil tongue multiplies transgression, and that it is equal to idolatry, adultery, and murder (h), and the cause of all sin; and which they express by way of fable, in this manner (i): <p>"when Adam sinned, God laid hold on him, and slit his tongue into two parts, and said unto him, the wickedness which is, or shall be in the world, thou hast begun with an evil tongue; wherefore I will make all that come into the world know that thy tongue is the cause of all this.'' <p>The Syriac version renders this clause thus, "and the world of iniquity is as wood"; or the branch of a tree; the tongue is fire, and a wicked world is fuel to it. <p>So is the tongue amongst our members, that it defileth the whole body: the body politic, a whole nation, filling it with contention, strife, division, and confusion; and the ecclesiastical body, the church, by sowing discord, fomenting animosities, making parties, and spreading errors and heresies, whereby the temple of God is defiled; and the natural body, and the several members of it, even the whole person of a man, soul and body, bringing upon him a blot of infamy and reproach never to be wiped off; as for instance, the vice of the tongue, lying, does; and oftentimes through the tongue, the actions done in the body, which seem good, are quite spoiled: <p>and setteth on fire the course of nature, or "wheel of nature": the natural body, as before, in which there is a continual rotation or circulation of the blood, by which it is supported; this is the wheel broken at the cistern at death, in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a> or the course of a man's life and actions, yea, of all generations, and the vicissitudes and changes which have happened in them, on which the tongue has a great influence; and so the Syriac version renders it, "and sets on fire the series of our genealogies, or our generations, which run like wheels": or it may intend the frame of nature, the whole fabric of the universe, and the general conflagration of it, which will be owing to the tongue; or because men's tongues are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory, because of the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against Christ and his people, of which they will be convinced by flames of fire about them: <p>and it is set on fire of hell; that is, by the devil; for as heaven sometimes is put for God, who dwells in heaven, <a href="/matthew/21-25.htm">Matthew 21:25</a> so hell is put for the devil, whose habitation it is; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>, and the sense is, that the tongue is influenced, instigated, and stirred up by Satan, to speak many evil things, and it will be hereafter set on fire in hell, as the tongue of the rich man in <a href="/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>.

If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.">Jam 3:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Several interpreters divide the first clause: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span>, into two corresponding parts, supplying the idea <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> to <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span>; thus Morus: igni respondet lingua, materiae seu silvae respondet mundus improbus. Manifestly wholly arbitrary; rather the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span> form an apposition to <span class="greekheb">ἡ γλῶσσα</span>, by which the power of the tongue similar to destructive fire is explained. <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> has here the same meaning as in LXX. <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm" title="Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.">Proverbs 17:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὅλος κόσμος τῶν χρημάτων</span>;[172] thus the multitude comprehending the individual: consequently <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΚΌΣΜΟς Τῆς ἈΔΙΚΊΑς</span></span></span> is <span class="ital">the fulness of unrighteousness.</span> The tongue is so called because, as the organ of <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>, it includes a fulness (not exactly the sum-total) of unrighteousness which from it pervades the other members (<span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμα</span>). Calvin correctly, according to the sense: acsi vocaret mare vel abyssum (Luther inaccurately: “a world full of wickedness”). This is the explanation of most expositors. Bouman correctly explains the definite article: famosus iste mundus iniquitatis. The following are other explanations:—(1) Oecumenius takes <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> = <span class="ital">ornament</span>, and explains: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΓΛῶΣΣΑ ΚΟΣΜΕῖ ΤῊΝ ἈΔΙΚΊΑΝ ΔΙᾺ Τῆς ΤῶΝ ῬΗΤΌΡΩΝ ΕὐΓΛΏΤΤΟΥ ΔΕΙΝΌΤΗΤΟς</span></span></span>; similarly Wetstein, Semler, Elsner, Rosenmüller, Storr, Lange[173] (Wahl is doubtful). But <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> never signifies in an active sense that which puts an ornament on another, but always the ornament itself, that wherewith a person adorns himself (or another). (2) Bretschneider likewise takes the word as equivalent to ornament, but supplies <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, and explains: ut ornatus (mulierum) inhonestus sc. inquinat mentes, sic lingua deprehenditur inter corporis membra id quod totum corpus inquinat; yet evidently more arbitrarily than the foregoing explanation. (3) Theile retains the usual meaning of the word <span class="ital">world</span>, and explains: lingua (est ignis), mundus (vero est) improbitatis i.e. improbitate plenus, nimirum ob illam ipsam linguae vim; but apart from the inadmissible supplements rendered necessary, and the harshness contained in this combination of the genitive, this explanation is to be rejected, because by it the words would contain an assertion on the nature of the world, instead of on the nature of the tongue. (4) Estius, indeed, is right in his comprehension of the idea, but he arbitrarily understands it as causative: quia (lingua) peccata omnigena parit; so also Herder: “the mainspring and the cause of all unrighteousness.” Gebser introduces something foreign into the explanation, taking <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> = the wicked world. Clericus, Hammond, Eichhorn, Kuinoel, and Hottinger, without any sufficient reason, think that the words are to be expunged from the text as spurious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whilst almost all expositors refer <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span> to what precedes (to which, according to the reading of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> which has <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> before the following <span class="greekheb">ἡ γλῶσσα</span>, it necessarily belongs), Tischendorf has put a point after <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span> but not after <span class="greekheb">ἀδικίας</span>;[174] and Neander translates: “As a world full of unrighteousness, the tongue is among our members;” so also Lange construes it. But this construction is not only difficult, but isolates too much the first thought <span class="greekheb">ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ</span>, which only has a correct meaning when it is closely connected with what follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The new clause accordingly begins with <span class="greekheb">ἡ γλῶσσα</span>, and <span class="greekheb">καθίσταται</span> has its necessary supplement in what follows: <span class="greekheb">ἡ σπιλοῦσα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθίσταται</span>] can neither here nor in chap. <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">Jam 4:4</a> mean <span class="ital">it stands:</span> the perfect only has this meaning, but not the present; it means: <span class="ital">it sets itself, it appears</span> (Wiesinger). Also the explanations are false: “it is so placed” (Pott); <span class="ital">collocata est</span> (Beza, Piscator, Schneckenburger); “it becomes (such)” (de Wette, appealing to <a href="/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>), and “it rules” (Lange, appealing to <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>). Theile arbitrarily completes the idea: hand raro. The words which follow mention how the tongue appears among the members—<span class="ital">as that which defileth the whole body.</span> The idea <span class="greekheb">σπιλοῦν</span>, to which certainly <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span> is not suited, is suggested by the apposition <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span>. Only with the following participle does James carry on the image of fire; it is artificial to assume in <span class="greekheb">σπιλοῦν</span> a reference to it. Bengel: maculans, ut ignis per fumum; comp. on this passage <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm" title="Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>. Neither the double <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (for how often the several <span class="greekheb">καί</span> succeed each other in a simple copulative sense!) nor the omission of the article before the two participles (comp. chap. <a href="/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.">Jam 4:11</a>; <a href="/james/4-14.htm" title="Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.">Jam 4:14</a>) proves that the participles which follow <span class="greekheb">καὶ φλογίζουσα</span> and <span class="greekheb">καὶ φλογιζομένη</span> are subordinated to <span class="greekheb">σπιλοῦσα</span> (Wiesinger). This construction could only be considered as correct if the two participles analyzed the idea <span class="greekheb">σπιλοῦσα ὅλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> into its individual parts or confirmed it; but neither of these is the case here; they rather add to this idea two new points. The object <span class="greekheb">τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως</span>, belonging to <span class="greekheb">φλογίζουσα</span>, has found very different explanations. The word <span class="greekheb">τροχός</span>, according to its etymology, denotes something <span class="ital">running</span>, and, although used of other rotatory orbs, as particularly of the potter’s wheel, it is especially used as a designation of a <span class="ital">wheel</span>, <a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1 Kings 7:30</a> ff.; <a href="/ezekiel/1-15.htm" title="Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel on the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.">Ezekiel 1:15</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-19.htm" title="And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up....">Ezekiel 1:19-20</a>. The word <span class="greekheb">γένεσις</span> can here be only in the same sense as in chap. <a href="/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">Jam 1:23</a>; the compound idea: <span class="ital">the wheel of birth, i.e.</span> “the wheel revolving from birth,” is a figurative designation of human life; comp. Anacreon, <span class="ital">Od.</span> iv. 7: <span class="greekheb">τροχὸς ἅρματος γὰρ οἷα βίστος τρέχει κυλισθείς</span>. Thus Gebser in particular correctly explains it: “the wheel which is set in motion from our birth, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> a poetical description of life;” so also Brückner and Bouman. The explanations of Oecumenius (<span class="greekheb">τροχός</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὁ βίος ὡς εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἀνελιττόμενος</span>), Calvin, Laurentius, Hornejus, Pott, Neander, amount to the same thing. Also Estius, Grotius, Carpzov, Michaelis understand life, only deriving this idea in a different manner. They explain <span class="greekheb">τροχός</span> (for which Grotius would read <span class="greekheb">τρόχος</span>) = cursus, <span class="greekheb">γένεσις</span> = natura, and cursus naturae = vita; by this explanation, however, the figurative nature of the expression suffers. Wiesinger (with whom Rauch agrees), deviating from this explanation, prefers to understand by it the whole body (<span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμα</span>), <span class="greekheb">τροχός</span> denoting either the <span class="ital">wheel</span> (by which, then, <span class="greekheb">τροχὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεν</span>. would be the revolving wheel of existence, of life, namely, of that to which the tongue belongs), or (which Wiesinger prefers) the <span class="ital">circumference</span> (thus <span class="greekheb">τροχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεν</span>. would be the circumference of being, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the circumference belonging to the tongue from birth, native to it). But, on the one hand, it is not to be supposed that James, after using the <span class="ital">ordinary</span> expression <span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμα</span>, should express the <span class="ital">same thing figuratively</span> without the least indication of the identity of meaning; and, on the other hand, it is opposed to the <span class="ital">first</span> interpretation that the <span class="ital">body</span> is not to be represented as a <span class="ital">wheel</span>, and to the <span class="ital">second</span> that <span class="greekheb">τροχός</span> is taken in a sense which it never has, for it never means the circumference, but at the most the <span class="ital">round</span> border which incloses something. Other expositors go beyond the restriction of the expression to the life of the individual,—which is evidently required by the foregoing <span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμα</span>,—either, with Wolf, appealing to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">גִּלְגַּל תּוֹלְרוֹת</span>, explaining it: indesinens <span class="ital">successio hominum</span> aliorum post alios nascentium (thus Lambert, Bos, Alberti, Augusti, Stäudlin),[175] or taking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΧΌς</span></span></span> = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΚΛΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΓΈΝΕΣΙς</span></span></span> = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΣΙς</span></span></span>, and accordingly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΓΕΝΈΣΕΩς</span></span></span> = “the circle of creation;” thus de Wette, and among the earlier interpreters Beza (in the edition of 1565), Crusius, Coccejus. All these ideas are foreign to the context. If the first explanation drags something “foreign” into it, the second bears besides “a monstrous character” (Wiesinger). Still less is the explanation of Lange to be justified: “the wheel of the development of life, primarily of the Jewish nation, and then further of all mankind,” since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΈΝΕΣΙς</span></span></span> never denotes <span class="ital">development of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[172] </span>It is to be observed that the LXX. often translate the Hebrew צָבָא by <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>; see <a href="/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[173] Lange, indeed, grants that <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is not an active idea, but he yet thinks that we must return to the original signification of the word, and he then explains it: “the tongue is the form of the world, worldliness, or worldly culture, because it is that which sophistically, etc., gives to unrighteousness its worldly … and even splendid form.” But is not the idea so explained taken in an active sense?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[174] Lachmann and Buttmann have, by leaving out the punctuation, left the pointing to the expositor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[175] Already the Syriac version translates: incendit proventus generationum nostrarum, quae currunt sicut rotae.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following are other explanations which are refuted by their arbitrariness and rarity:—(1) that of Semler, who explains it <span class="ital">ordo generandi</span>, according to the expression occurring in Plutarch: <span class="greekheb">ποταμὸν τῆς γενέσεως ἐνδελεχῶς</span>; (2) that of Bengel rota sive sphaera superior est ipsa natura humana rationalis; gehenna vero est pars profundior cor; lingua in medio ex inferioribus inflammatur et superiora inflammat; (3) that of Meyer (<span class="ital">Observatt. ad ep. Jacobi</span>), who takes the expression = sanguinis orbis seu circulato; lastly, (4) that of Kype, who assumes the rota poenalis is figuratively meant cujus radiis illigabantur rei, and accordingly <span class="greekheb">φλογίζειν τὸν τροχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γενέσεως</span> means: augere vitae hujus cruciatus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb <span class="greekheb">φλογίζειν</span> is in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.; in the LXX. it is found in <a href="/exodus/9-24.htm" title="So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.">Exodus 9:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-3.htm" title="A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies round about.">Psalm 97:3</a>, and other places. The figurative expression, which refers back to <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span>, indicates the fatal effect which the tongue, from which the pollution of the whole body proceeds, exercises on the life of man, whilst it pervades the same by its passionate heat. James so presents it, that being <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span>, and thus concentrating in itself (or in word) a fulness of unrighteousness, it forms, as it were, the axle round which the wheel of life moves, and by which it is set on fire. Morus incorrectly understands <span class="greekheb">φλογίζειν</span> “de damnis, quae lingua dat;” but the discourse is not concerning the injury which man suffers, but concerning his moral conduct; still less corresponding is the explanation of Michaelis, according to which <span class="greekheb">φλογίζειν</span> = to inflame, and that in the words of James the thought is contained: “lingua saepe alii excitantur, ut insano studio mala ingrediantur.” The representation that the tongue defiles the whole body and sets the life on fire is, as Wiesinger correctly remarks, not to be justified by the remark that all sins have their foundation in the sins of the tongue, but rests on the observation that <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>, before it manifests itself in other ways, first and foremost appears in word, and thus the tongue is its most direct organ.[176] The second participial sentence states whence the tongue receives this destructive power (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΛΟΓΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>), by which also the idea that it is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟς Τῆς ἈΔΙΚΊΑς</span></span></span> finds its justification. The participle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΛΟΓΙΖΟΜΈΝΗ</span></span></span> is to be retained in the sense of the <span class="ital">present;</span> it has neither the meaning of the <span class="ital">perfect</span>, as if the tongue had been only once set on fire by <span class="greekheb">γεέννα</span>, nor is it, with Grotius, Mill, Benson, Semler, Storr, Rosenmüller, to be taken as <span class="ital">future</span>, and to be referred to future punishment. The expression <span class="greekheb">γεέννα</span>, except in the Synoptics, is only found here; in <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-9.htm" title="And if your eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.">Matthew 18:9</a>, <a href="/mark/9-47.htm" title="And if your eye offend you, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:">Mark 9:47</a>, it is used for a more exact description of the genitive <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΠΥΡΌς</span></span></span>. The thought that the tongue is set on fire of hell is not to be explained away either by ex inferno being paraphrased by Theile by igne diabolico, and this by igne foedissimo ac funestissimo; or by being explained with Morus: tantus est ille ignis, ut ex geennae igne <span class="ital">videatur</span> esse incensus. James means that as <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> (or more precisely <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span>), whose most direct organ is the tongue, has its origin from the devil, it is thus from hell (see <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a>). Also in the O. T. the injurious effects of the tongue are described; see <a href="/psalms/52-4.htm" title="You love all devouring words, O you deceitful tongue.">Psalm 52:4</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/120-3.htm" title="What shall be given to you? or what shall be done to you, you false tongue?...">Psalm 120:3-4</a>, <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm" title="Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.">Proverbs 26:27</a>, and other passages (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-13.htm" title="Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his fall.">Sir 5:13</a> ff; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/28-11.htm" title="An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood.">Sir 28:11</a> ff.); yet in all these passages the discourse is only on the evil which is inflicted by it on others, or on the punishment which befalls the man who misuses it. This peculiar thought of James has its counterpart in no passage of the O. T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[176] The view that James considered the tongue as the source of <span class="ital">all</span> sin is erroneous, since he, however prominently he brings forward the destructive power of the tongue, yet never asserts this. The restriction to <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> is justified by the Epistle itself. See <a href="/context/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:...">Jam 1:19-20</a>; <a href="/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a>, <a href="/context/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors....">Jam 2:9-10</a>; <a href="/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">Jam 2:13</a> (the opposite <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι σοφίας</span>); 14, etc. According to this, in this edition the text in some places has been rectified.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">Jam 3:6</a>.

From this it appears that the first thought is resumed and expounded in the last two lines, while the centre doublet contains a parallelism in itself. The effect is that of an underground flame concealed for a while, then breaking out afresh. Thus <span class="greekheb">φλογίζουσα</span> and <span class="greekheb">φλογιζομένη</span> refer to <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span>, and <span class="greekheb">σπιλοῦσα</span> to <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, though grammatically these participles are in agreement with <span class="greekheb">γλῶσσα</span>.”—<span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span>: This expression is an extremely difficult one, and a large variety of interpretations have been suggested; the real <span class="ital">crux</span> is, of course, the meaning of <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>. In this Epistle <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is always used in a bad sense, <a href="/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">Jam 1:27</a>, <a href="/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">Jam 2:5</a>, <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">Jam 4:4</a>. In the Septuagint <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> is several times the rendering of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">צבא</span>, “host” (of heaven, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the stars, etc.), see <a href="/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; there is no Hebrew word which corresponds to <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, properly speaking; and it would therefore be no matter of surprise if a Jew with a knowledge of Hebrew should use <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> in a loose sense. In the N.T. <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> is often used in the same sense as <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="/mark/4-19.htm" title="And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.">Mark 4:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>, of this world; here again it is mostly in an evil sense in which it is referred to, whether as <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> or <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>. It is, therefore, possible that <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> might be used in the sense of <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>, by a Jew, but as referring to a sphere not on this earth. Schegg (quoted by Mayor) interprets the phrase, “the sphere or domain of iniquity,” and though this is not the natural meaning of <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, this cannot be urged as an insuperable objection to his interpretation; we are dealing with the work of an Oriental, and a Jew, in an age long ago, and we must not therefore look for strict accuracy. If <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> may be regarded as being used in the sense of <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>, which is applicable to this world or to the world to come, then Schegg’s “domain of iniquity” might refer to a sphere in the next world. When it is further noticed that the tongue is called “fire,” and that this fire has been kindled by <span class="greekheb">ἡ γέεννα</span>, the place of burning, it becomes possible to regard the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας</span> as a symbolic expression of Gehenna (see further below, under <span class="greekheb">τῆς γεέννης</span>).—<span class="greekheb">καθίσταται</span>: “is set,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “is constituted”. Mayor says: “It is opposed to <span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχω</span>, because it implies a sort of adaptation or development as contrasted with the natural or original state; to <span class="greekheb">γίγνομαι</span>, because it implies something of fixity”.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ σπιλοῦσα</span>: <span class="greekheb">σπίλος</span> means a “stain,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/judges/1-23.htm" title="And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)">Judges 1:23</a>.—<span class="greekheb">φλογίζουσα</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. in N.T., <span class="ital">cf.</span> Wisd. 3:28.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως</span>. “the wheel of nature,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the whole circle of innate passions; the meaning is that this wrong use of the tongue engenders jealousy, and faction, and every vile deed, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/james/3-16.htm" title="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.">Jam 3:16</a>. For the different interpretations of the phrase see Mayor.—<span class="greekheb">φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης</span>: In Jewish theology two ideas regarding the fate of the wicked hereafter existed, at one time, concurrently; according to the one, Hades (<span class="ital">Sheol</span>) was the place to which the spirits of all men, good as well as bad, went after death; at the resurrection, the good men arose and dwelt in glory, while the wicked remained in Sheol. According to a more developed belief, the place of the departed was not the same for the good and the bad; the former went to a place of rest, and awaited the final resurrection, while the latter went to a place of torment; after the resurrection the good enter into eternal bliss, the wicked into eternal woe, but whether these latter continue in the same place in which they had hitherto been, or whether it is a different peace of torment, is not clear. A realistic conception of the place of torment arose when the “Valley of Hinnom” (<span class="greekheb">גי־הנם</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἡ γέεννα</span>), was pointed out as the place in which the spirits of the wicked suffered; but very soon this conception became spiritualised, and there arose the belief that the Valley of Hinnom was only the <span class="ital">type</span> of what actually existed in the next world. The fire which burned in the Valley of Hinnom was likewise transferred to the next worm; hence the phrases: <span class="greekheb">γέεννα τοῦ πυρός</span>, <span class="greekheb">κάμινος τοῦ πυρός</span>, etc. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> 4 Esdr. 7:36; <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>, etc.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity</span>] The last words are in apposition with the subject, not the predicate, of the sentence. The tongue is described as emphatically <span class="bld">that world</span>—we should perhaps say, that <span class="ital">microcosm</span>—<span class="bld">of unrighteousness</span>. As uttering all evil thoughts and desires, no element of unrighteousness was absent from it, and that which includes all the elements of anything well deserves the name of being its <span class="ital">Cosmos</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so is the tongue among our members</span>] The particle of comparison is not found in the best MSS., but is clearly implied, and is therefore legitimately inserted in the translation, as it is in some later MSS. The sentence strictly runs, <span class="ital">The tongue</span> <span class="bld">is set</span> <span class="ital">in our members</span>, referring of course not to a Divine appointment, but to its actual position. It is, as a fact, that which “defiles”, better perhaps <span class="bld">spots</span> or <span class="bld">stains</span>, the whole body. Every evil word is thought of as leaving its impress, it may be an indelible impress, as a blot upon the whole character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and setteth on fire the course of nature</span>] The last words have no parallel in any Greek author, and are therefore naturally somewhat difficult. Literally, we might render, <span class="bld">the wheel of nature</span> or <span class="bld">of birth</span>, just as in ch. <a href="/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">James 1:23</a> we found “the face of nature,” for the “natural face,” that with which we are born. The best interpretation seems to be that which sees in the phrase a figure for “the whole of life from birth;” the wheel which then begins to roll on its course, and continues rolling until death. The comparison of life to a race, or course of some kind, has been familiar to the poetry of all ages, and in a Latin poet, Silius Italicus (vi. 120), we have a phrase almost identical with St James’s,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Talis lege Deûm clivoso tramite vitæ<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Per varios præceps casus <span class="ital">rota</span> volvitur <span class="ital">ævi</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“So by the law of God, through chance and change,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The wheel of life</span> rolls down the steep descent.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What is meant, if we adopt this view, is that from the beginning of life to its close, the tongue is an ever-present inflammatory element of evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As an alternative explanation it is possible that there may be a reference to the potter’s wheel, as in <a href="/jeremiah/18-3.htm" title="Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he worked a work on the wheels.">Jeremiah 18:3</a>, and <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-29.htm" title="So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number;">Sir 38:29</a>, in the latter of which the same word for “wheel” is used. On this view the tongue would be represented as the flame that by its untempered heat mars the vessel in the hands of the potter. The frequent parallelisms between St James and the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach, are, as far as they go, in favour of this view, but the former seems to me, on the whole, preferable. A third view, that the words have the same kind of meaning as <span class="ital">orbis terrarum</span>, and mean, as in the English Version, the whole order or course of nature, i.e. of human history in the world at large, has, it is believed, less to recommend it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and it is set on fire of hell</span>] The Greek participle is in the present. <span class="ital">The tongue that speaks evil is ever</span> <span class="bld">being set on fire of Gehenna</span>. St James does not shrink from tracing sins of speech to their source. The fire of man’s wrath is kindled from beneath, as the fire that cleanses is kindled from above. Bearing in our minds the wonder of the day of Pentecost, it is hardly too bold to say that we have to choose whether our tongue shall be purified by the fire of the Holy Spirit or defiled by that of Gehenna. The latter word is that employed in the Gospels, as here, for “Hell”, wherever that word means, not simply the place of the dead, which is expressed in the Greek by Hades, the unseen world, but the place of torment. Primarily, the word is a Hebrew one, signifying the Valley of Hinnom. As that valley had been in the days of the idolatries of Judah the scene of the fires of Moloch worship (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:...">Jeremiah 19:5-6</a>), and had in later times become the <span class="ital">cloaca</span> where the filth and offal of the city were consumed in fires kept continually burning (so it is commonly said, but the fact is not quite certain), it came to be among the later Rabbis what Tartarus was to the Greeks, the symbol of the dread penalties of evil. Comp. <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>, <a href="/mark/9-43.htm" title="And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:43</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">Jam 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">the world</span>) This is part of the subject, with the addition of the article (as <span class="greekheb">ἡ σπιλοῦσα</span>, which follows), showing why the tongue is called <span class="ital">fire:</span> namely, because it is a world (in the Vulgate <span class="ital">universitas, a universe</span>) <span class="ital">of iniquity</span>. The words, <span class="ital">how great a matter</span>, and <span class="ital">the world</span>, refer to each other. As the little world of man is an image of the universe,[35] so the tongue is an image of the little world of man, exciting it altogether. There is a frequent metaphor from the universe to the lesser world: <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm" title="My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth.">Psalm 139:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm" title="While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>; and not only to man: there is a reference to the whale, <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm" title="For you had cast me into the deep, in the middle of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your billows and your waves passed over me.">Jonah 2:3</a>; <a href="/context/jonah/2-6.htm" title="I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God....">Jonah 2:6-7</a>. James employs this figure. <span class="ital">The world</span> has its higher and its lower parts: these are, in a better point of view, the heaven and the earth; in a worse, the earth and hell. And as in the world, heaven or hell is with reference to the earth; so in man, the heart, of which the tongue is the instrument, is with reference to the whole <span class="ital">body</span> or nature. For in the case of the good, heaven, and in the case of the wicked, hell, has its veins in the heart: from which source so many wonders are diffused to <span class="ital">the course of nature</span> (nativitatis). We may learn from <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm" title="The voice of your thunder was in the heaven: the lightning lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.">Psalm 77:18</a>, what is meant by this <span class="ital">course</span>. <span class="greekheb">Φωνὴ τῆς βροντῆς σου ἐν τῷ τροχῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔφαναν αἱ ἀστραπαί σου τῇ οἰκουμένῃ</span>. <span class="ital">The voice of Thy thunder teas in the heaven, Thy lightnings lightened the world:</span> for as in that passage <span class="greekheb">גלגל</span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΧῸς</span></span></span>, as opposed to <span class="greekheb">חבל</span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ ΟἸΚΟΥΜΕΝῌ</span></span></span>, denotes the celestial or aerial sphere, so in this place <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΧῸς Τῆς ΓΕΝΈΣΕΩς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">the course of nature</span>, as opposed to <span class="greekheb">τῇ γεέννῃ</span>, <span class="ital">hell</span>, or the heart, denotes the higher parts of the earth, or the entire nature of man, which holds a middle place between heaven and hell; and thus it denotes the <span class="ital">body</span> with its entire temperament. Comp. <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a>, <span class="ital">from above, earthly, devilish</span>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΈΝΕΣΙς</span></span></span>, the natural constitution; <a href="/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">Jam 1:23</a>; and life; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/12-18.htm" title="So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.">Jdt 12:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΣΑς ΤᾺς ἩΜΈΡΑς Τῆς ΓΕΝΈΣΕΏς ΜΟΥ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">all the days since I was born</span>. The metaphor is taken from <span class="ital">a round wheel</span>, and is very appropriate: for as a wheel is turned about with great velocity; so it is with the sphere of heaven, and the nature of man; and this being set on fire while it revolves, soon breaks out into a blaze in every part, so that the fire seems not only to be borne in a circle, but also to be a circle. Respecting <span class="ital">the flaming wheels</span> of the Divine throne, see <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>, <span class="ital">so</span>) This word not read in the African copies, has been introduced into this place from the beginning of the fifth verse.[36] If the apostle had intended to use it a second time in this comparison, he would have used it at the beginning, and not in the middle of the Apodosis, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὝΤΩ ΚΑῚ Ἡ ΓΛῶΣΣΑ ΠῦΡ</span></span></span>. A few copies, but those of great authority, omit <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὝΤΩς</span></span></span>. Isidorus of Pelusinm in particular joining them.

In this second declaration <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΓΛῶΣΣΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">the tongue</span>, is as it were the Subject, and is repeated a second time by way of Anaphora[37] and emphasis, as far as the particle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὝΤΩς</span>·<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> the predicate is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΊΣΤΑΤΑΙ</span>—<span class="greekheb">ΤῸ ΣῶΜΑ</span></span></span>, in this easy sense; <span class="ital">the tongue is that which defiles the whole body</span>. Between these two clauses <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> seems to be out of place; so far is the sense from being <span class="ital">impaired</span> by the removal of <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>. This is followed by the explanation, <span class="ital">inasmuch as being that which both inflames and is itself inflamed</span>, etc.; where, by a metaphor from the universe (the macrocosm) to man (the microcosm), the <span class="ital">wheel</span>, or higher sphere (comp. <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm" title="The voice of your thunder was in the heaven: the lightning lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.">Psalm 77:18</a>), is man’s rational <span class="ital">nature</span> itself; but <span class="ital">hell</span> is the lower part, the heart. <span class="ital">The tongue</span>, situated in the middle, is inflamed by the lower parts, and inflames the higher, being itself a <span class="ital">world</span>, or orb of iniquity. Thus I hope that those things which Wolf has remarked on this passage, will be explained; and I am quite willing that the things which I have said should be compared with <span class="ital">the interpretation of Baumgarten</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καθίσταται</span>) The same word occurs ch. <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">Jam 4:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΙΛΟῦΣΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">defiling</span>) as fire, by smoke.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ φλογίζουσα καὶ φλογιζομένη</span>) inasmuch as <span class="ital">being that which both inflames and is inflamed</span>.

A fourth rendering, which is wholly untenable, deserves notice for its antiquity, viz. that of the Syriac, "The tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity (is the forest)." <span class="cmt_word">The world of iniquity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The tongue is thus characterized, because it leads to and embraces all kinds of wickednesses. As Bishop Wordsworth points out, it contains within itself the elements of all mischief. A somewhat similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in the LXX. of <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "The whole world of wealth is for the faithful: for the faithless not a penny." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: "is set" or "<span class="accented">has</span> its place," and so simply "<span class="accented">is."</span> The tongue <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> defiles the whole body, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> sets on fire <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the wheel of birth" or "of nature" - a very strange expression, and one almost without parallel. (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> only here in the New Testament. There is, however, no doubt about its meaning "wheel." The A.V., which took it as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "course," is universally given up (see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T.,' p. 62). For <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, comp. <a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23</a>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">retain nativitatis nostrae.</span>) Alford translates the phrase, "the orb of the creation," and in favor of this the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a>. (76.) 19 may be appealed to. But more natural is the interpretation of Dean Plumptre, who takes it as "a figure for the whole of life from birth, the wheel which then begins to roll on its course and continues rolling until death." So Huther and Dean Scott in the ' Speaker's Commentary.' This view has the support of the Syriac Version: "The course of our generations which run as a wheel;" and is implied in the (false) reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (compare the Vulgate). It should also be noticed that life is compared to a wheel in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And is set on fire.</span> The tongue has already been called a fire. It is now shown how that fire is kindled - kern beneath, kern Gehenna. A similar expression is found in the Targum on <a href="/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a>, "Lingua dolosa ... cum carbonibus juniperi, qui incensi sunt in Gehenna interne." Gehenna, here personified, is mentioned also in <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29, 30</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-9.htm">Matthew 18:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15, 33</a>; <a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43, 45, 47</a>; <a href="/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>. Thus the passage before us is the <span class="accented">only one</span> in the New Testament where the word is used except, by our Lord himself. The word itself is simply a Graecised form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "<span class="accented">valley</span> of <span class="accented">Hinnom</span>," or fully, "<span class="accented">valley</span> of the sons of Hinnom" (variously rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>). This valley, from its associations, became a type of hell; and hence its name was taken by the Jews to denote the place of torment. In this sense it occurs in the New Testament, and frequently in Jewish writings (see Buxtorf, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub verb.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), and it is said that the later rabbis actually fixed upon this valley as the mouth of hell. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>World of iniquity (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, primarily, means order, and is applied to the world or universe as an orderly system. A world of iniquity is an organism containing within itself all evil essence, which from it permeates the entire man. World is used in the same sense as in the latter part of <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a> (Sept.), which is not given in the A. V. "The trusty hath the whole world of things, but the faithless not a groat."<p>Is the tongue (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>This differs a little from the simple is, though it is not easy to render it accurately. The verb means to appoint, establish, institute, and is used of the tongue as having an appointed and definite place in a system (among our members). It might be rendered hath its place.<p>Defileth (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., defiling. Only here and Jde 1:23. See on <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>.<p>Setteth on fire (&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., setting on fire. Only in this verse in New Testament.<p>The course of nature (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>A very obscure passage. &#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, (only here in New Testament), from &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;, to run, applies generally to anything round or circular which runs or rolls, as a wheel or sphere. Hence, often a wheel. Used of the circuit of fortifications and of circles or zones of land or sea. From the radical sense, to run, comes the meaning course, as the course of the sun; and from this a place for running, a race-course. &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; rendered nature, means origin, beginning, birth, manner of birth, production, and is used by Plato for the creation, or the sum of created things. It also means a race, and a generation or age. In the New Testament it occurs but twice outside of this epistle, viz., at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>, "the book of the generation of Jesus Christ," where the meaning is origin or birth; the birth-book of Jesus Christ. The other passage is <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>, according to the best texts, also meaning birth. In <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23</a>, as we have seen, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, is the face of his birth. We may then safely translate &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; by wheel; and as birth is the meaning of &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; in every New-Testament passage where it occurs, we may give it the preference here and render the wheel of birth - i.e., the wheel which is set in motion at birth and runs on to the close of life. It is thus a figurative description of human life. So Anacreon:<p>"The chariot-wheel, like life, runs rolling round,"<p>Tertullian says: "The whole revolving wheel of existence bears witness to the resurrection of the dead." The Rev., which gives nature, puts birth in margin. This revolving wheel is kindled by the tongue, and rolls on in destructive blaze. The image is justified by the fact. The tongue works the chief mischief, kindles the most baleful fires in the course of life. </body></html>
