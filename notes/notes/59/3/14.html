But that against which the Apostle inveighed had caused Jerusalem to run with blood, and afterwards helped in her last hour to add horror upon shame. The Zealots were really assassins, pledged to any iniquity; such were the forty men “who bound themselves under a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul” (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a>; see Note there). Some of these desperadoes unluckily escaped the swords of the Romans, and fled to the fastnesses of Mount Lebanon. They were probably the nucleus of a still more infamous society, known in the middle ages as that of the Old Man of the Mountain; in fact, our word “assassin” comes from “Hassan,” their first sheik. Happily for humanity they were at length exterminated by the Turks.<p><span class= "bld">Glory not.</span>—<span class= "ital">Boast not</span> yourselves as partakers of this accursed zeal; behold already what ruin it is bringing on us as a nation and a Church. And it were well to take care even in these milder days of religious factions, that the strife of creeds be wholly different in kind from the old zealot feuds, and not merely in degree. Able only to rend and overthrow, party-spirit will, if it be gloried and exulted in, lay down the walls of Zion “even to the ground.” But “if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy” (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>), and the words must be translated much more sternly, “If any man <span class= "ital">destroy</span> . . .”<p><span class= "bld">Lie not against the truth.</span>—This is not tautology, nor a Hebraism, but of far deeper import. “What is truth?” said jesting Pilate (<a href="/john/18-38.htm" title="Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find in him no fault at all.">John 18:38</a>), and, as Bacon remarks in his <span class= "ital">Essay on Truth, </span>he would not stay for an answer. Probably he put a question familiar to himself, learned in a certain school of knowledge whose wise conclusion was that mankind could not tell; and the inquirer turned away, unwitting that before him stood the incarnate Truth itself. The world of unbelief repeats the careless utterance of the Roman Governor, and holds with him in its new Agnosticism; and to its self-assurance and pride of life He, Who can only be learned in the doing of His will (<a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>), is alike unknowable and unknown. But the words of the Apostle have a mournful significance for the ignorant of God; and a terrible one for the Christian who knows and sins against the Light. Falsehood is not the hurt of some abstract virtue, or bare rule of right and wrong, but a direct blow at the living Truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>), Who suffered and still “endures such contradiction of sinners against Himself” (<a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm" title="For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.">Hebrews 12:3</a>). As the fault of Judas was double—personal treachery against his Friend and Master, and a wider attack on Christ, the Truth manifest in the flesh—so in a like two-fold manner we smite at once God and our brother when we speak or act a lie. All faintest shades of falsehood tend to the dark one of a fresh betrayal of the Son of Man if they be conceived against others, while if they be wrought only to shield ourselves, we are. as Montaigne observed, “brave before God, and cowards before men,” who are as the dust of His feet.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-18 These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise, and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts - If that is your characteristic.

On <span class="greekheb">κατακαυχᾶσθε</span>, comp. chap. <a href="/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">Jam 2:13</a> (see Winer, p. 417 [E. T. 590, note 1]). In <span class="greekheb">κατακαυχᾶσθε</span> the reference is to others, in <span class="greekheb">ψεύδεσθε</span> to one’s own conscience (Lange). In order to avoid the tautology in <span class="greekheb">ψεύδεσθε</span> and <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀληθείας</span>, Wiesinger understands by <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεία</span> “truth in an objective Christian sense—the Christian truth, by the possession of which they fancied themselves <span class="greekheb">σοφοί</span>.”[183] But, on the contrary, it is to be considered that that which, logically considered, appears as mere tautology, receives another import, when not only the understanding but also the disposition is recognised as a factor of the construction; so it is here; compare, moreover, Isocrates, <span class="ital">de pace</span>, p. 165: <span class="greekheb">διαψεύδεσθαι τῆς ἀληθείας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[183] According to Lange, the theocratic truth is to be understood which the Jewish zealots professed to protect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/3-14.htm" title="But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.">Jam 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ ζῆλον πικρὸν ἔχετε καὶ ἐριθείαν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν</span>: This makes it quite clear that what has been referred to all along is controversial strife; the bitter use of the tongue which the writer has been reprobating is the personal abuse which had been heaped upon one another by the partisans of rival schools of thought. <span class="greekheb">ζῆλον</span> is mostly used in a bad sense in the N.T., though the opposite is sometimes the case (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm" title="And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.">Galatians 1:14</a>); the intensity of feeling which had been aroused among those to whom the Epistle was addressed is seen by the words <span class="greekheb">ζῆλον πικρόν</span>, with the latter word in an emphatic position; they form a striking contrast to <span class="greekheb">πραΰτητι σοφίας</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">ἐριθείαν</span>, derived from <span class="greekheb">ἔριθος</span> “a hireling,” means “party-spirit”.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ κατακαυχᾶσθε</span>: the malicious triumphing at the least point of vantage gained by one party was just the thing calculated to embitter the other side; this was a real “lying against the truth,” because such petty triumphs are often gained at the expense of truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts</span>] Better, <span class="ital">envy and</span> <span class="bld">rivalry</span>. The latter substantive, formed from a word which means a “day-labourer”, expresses primarily the temper of competition that characterised the class, and then more generally, faction and party-spirit of any kind. It is significant that the word for “envy” is used by St Luke as specially characterising the temper of the Jews towards the Gentile converts (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm" title="But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.">Acts 13:45</a>), and this, together with what we have seen of the true bearing of ch. <a href="/context/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?...">James 2:14-26</a>, leads to the conclusion that St James’s warning is specially addressed to those of the Circumcision who displayed that feeling. He is shewing himself not the antagonist, but the supporter of St Paul’s work, condemning the factious spirit which was then, as afterwards at Corinth (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>), in Galatia (<a href="/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>), and at Rome (<a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a>), his chief hindrance. The word “bitter” is perhaps added to “envy” because the Greek word “zeal” was neutral, and admitted of a good meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">glory not</span>] The word expresses a relative, not an absolute glorying, a glorying <span class="bld">over</span> some one, on the ground of superior privileges. This was, it is obvious, likely to be the besetting sin of the party of the Circumcision in relation to the Gentiles, and was therefore checked by St James, just as afterwards, when the prospect of the rejection of Israel was becoming a certainty, it became, in its turn, the sin of the Gentile converts, and was then checked by St Paul (<a href="/romans/11-18.htm" title="Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you bore not the root, but the root you.">Romans 11:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lie not against the truth</span>] It is clear that if the word “truth” were only subjective in its meaning, as meaning “truthfulness,” the precept would be open to the charge of tautology. We must therefore assume that it is used with an objective force, as the truth of God revealed in Christ. We ask what special truth thus revealed those to whom St James wrote were most in danger of denying, and the answer lies on the surface. They were claiming God as the God of the Jews only (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm" title="Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:">Romans 3:29</a>), denying the brotherhood of mankind in Christ, “lying against” the very truth of which they fancied that they were the exclusive possessors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/3-14.htm" title="But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.">Jam 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ζῆλον πικρὸν</span>, <span class="ital">bitter emulation</span>) Emulation is not condemned, when exercised with kindness; nor anger, accompanied with kindness, and proceeding from faithfulness and love.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ</span>, do <span class="ital">not</span>) They boast and lie against the truth, who, when they have bitter emulation, still give out that they themselves have wisdom.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ κατακαυχᾶσθε</span>) The Alex. and others read <span class="greekheb">μὴ καυχᾶσθε</span>.[45] See App. Crit., Ed ii.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] <span class="greekheb">Κατακαυχᾶσθε</span> is the reading of BC. <span class="greekheb">Καυχᾶσθε</span>, of A.—E.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bitter envying</span>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in itself may be either good or bad, and therefore <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is added to characterize it.

(On the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, both of which are used by St. James, see Archbishop Trench on 'Synonyms,' &sect; 26.). <span class="cmt_word">Strife</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); better, <span class="accented">party spirit</span>, or <span class="accented">faction</span> (cf. <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-17.htm">Philippians 1:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>). The A.V. "strife" comes from a wrong derivation, as if <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> were connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, whereas it really comes from <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> hired laborer, and so signifies <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> working for hire; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the canvassing of hired partisans; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> factiousness in general (see Lightfoot on <a href="/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Glory not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> glory not of your wisdom, a boast to which your whole conduct thus gives the lie. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Envying (&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The word is used in the New Testament both in a bad and a good sense. For the latter, see <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>; <a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>. From it is our word zeal, which may be either good or bad, wise or foolish. The bad sense is predominant in the New Testament. See <a href="/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>, and here, where the bad sense is defined and emphasized by the epithet bitter. It is often joined with &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; strife, as here with &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, intriguing or faction. The rendering envying, as A. V., more properly belongs to &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which is never used in a good sense. Emulation is the better general rendering, which does not necessarily include envy, but may be full of the spirit of self-devotion. Rev. renders jealousy.<p>Strife (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>A wrong rendering, founded on the mistaken derivation from &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, strife. It is derived from &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a hired servant, and means, primarily, labor for hire. Compare Tobit 2:11: My wife did take women's work to do (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;). Thus it comes to be applied to those who serve in official positions for their own selfish interest, and who, to that end, promote party spirit and faction. So <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a> : them that are contentious (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), lit., of faction. Rev., factious. Also, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>. Rev., here, rightly, faction. </body></html>
