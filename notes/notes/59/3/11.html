Estius observes, “that the apostle’s design was to confirm his doctrine by four similitudes; the first taken from fountains, the second and third from fruit-trees, and the fourth from the sea, which being in its nature salt, does not produce fresh water.” He therefore approves of the reading of the Alexandrian MS., which is, <span class="ital">So neither can salt water produce sweet. </span>The Syriac version reads, <span class="ital">Salt waters cannot be made sweet; </span>and the Vulgate, <span class="ital">So neither can salt water make fresh water. </span>In like manner, we ought to maintain a consistency in our words or discourses; and if we profess religion and devotion, we should speak at all times as persons who are endeavouring to employ our tongues to the noble purposes for which the use of speech was granted to man.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place - Margin, "hole."

Fountain has the article, "the fountain," generic. See Introduction, on James' local allusions. The Land of Promise was pictured to the Hebrew as a land of springs (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>). "Palestine," says Dean Stanley, "was the only country where an Eastern could have been familiar with the language of the Psalmsist: 'He sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the mountains.' Those springs, too, however short-lived, are remarkable for their copiousness and beauty. Not only not in the East, but hardly in the West, can any fountains and sources of streams be seen, so clear, so full-grown even at their birth, as those which fall into the Jordan and its lakes throughout its whole course from north to south" ("Sinai and Palestine"). The Hebrew word for a fountain or spring is a&#769;yin, meaning an eye. "The spring," says the same author, "is the bright, open source, the eye of the landscape." <p>Send forth (&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>An expressive word, found nowhere else in the New Testament, and denoting a full, copious discharge.
