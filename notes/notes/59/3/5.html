The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even so the tongue is a little member - Little compared with the body, as the bit or the rudder is, compared with the horse or the ship.<p>And boasteth great things - The design of the apostle is to illustrate the power and influence of the tongue. This may be done in a great many respects: and the apostle does it by referring to its boasting; to the effects which it produces, resembling that of fire, <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>; to its untameableness, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/3-8.htm">James 3:8-9</a>; and to its giving utterance to the most inconsistent and incongruous thoughts, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>. The particular idea here is, that the tongue seems to be conscious of its influence and power, and boasts largely of what it can do. The apostle means doubtless to convey the idea that it boasts not unjustly of its importance. It has all the influence in the world, for good or for evil, which it claims.<p>Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! - Margin, "wood." The Greek word &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  hule&#772;n, means a wood, forest, grove; and then fire-wood, fuel. This is the meaning here. The sense is, that a very little fire is sufficient to ignite a large quantity of combustible materials, and that the tongue produces effects similar to that. A spark will kindle a lofty pile; and a word spoken by the tongue may set a neighborhood or a village "in a flame." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. boasteth great things&#8212;There is great moment in what the careless think "little" things [Bengel].

Application of the comparison, particularly of the second illustration, <span class="greekheb">μικρόν</span>, pointing back to <span class="greekheb">ἐλαχίστου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μεγαλαυχεῖν</span>] which expresses the contrast to <span class="greekheb">μικρόν</span> is not = <span class="greekheb">μεγάλα ἐργάζεσθαι</span> (Oecumenius, Theophylact, Calvin, Laurentius, Pott, Bouman, and others), for the idea of <span class="ital">doing</span> is precisely not contained in the word, but it denotes proud conduct in word and behaviour, which has for supposition the performance of great things, and is always used in a bad sense. This certainly does not appear to suit <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>, as in the preceding the discourse is not about talking, on which account Lange prefers the reading <span class="greekheb">μεγάλα αὐχεῖ</span>; but also this expression = “boasteth great things,” does not exclude, but includes that secondary meaning, for why would not James otherwise have written simply <span class="greekheb">μεγάλα ποιεῖ</span>? But <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> is so far not unsuitable, as the performance of great things—as they are spoken of in the foregoing—forms the reason of the boasting of the tongue. On a mere <span class="ital">inanis jactatio</span> it is not natural here to think. This first clause already points to what follows, where the <span class="ital">destructive</span> power of the tongue is described. This description begins with a figure: “<span class="ital">What a fire kindles what a forest.</span>” In justification of the reading <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκον</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγον</span>), de Wette (with whom Brückner agrees), translating <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκον πῦρ</span>: “what a <span class="ital">great</span> fire,” observes, “that the burning of the forest is contemplated in its whole extent.” But the verb <span class="greekheb">ἀνάπτει</span>, as Wiesinger correctly observes, is opposed to this explanation; also this clause forms the transition from the foregoing to what follows, and therefore must still contain the reference to <span class="greekheb">μικρόν</span>, which certainly is afterwards laid aside. This does not, however, constrain us to the rejection of the reading <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκον</span> (against Wiesinger and Bouman), since this word, which indeed chiefly emphasizes greatness, can also be used to give prominence to smallness; see Pape. The older expositors, according to its meaning, correctly explained the <span class="ital">quantus</span> of the Vulgate by <span class="ital">quantulus;</span> thus Cajetan., Paes, and others; the same explanation by Lange. If Brückner thinks that it is not appropriate to take <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκον</span> here in this signification, owing to the following <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκην</span>, it is, on the contrary, to be observed that precisely the opposition of the same word in a different signification is entirely in accordance with the liveliness of the sentiment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the use of <span class="greekheb">ἡλίκος</span> in the interrogative explanatory sense, see A. Buttmann, p. 217 [E. T. 253]. Erasmus, Laurentius, Grotius, Baumgarten, Augusti explain the word <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> by materia, lignorum congeries, as it has in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/28-10.htm" title="As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed.">Sir 28:10</a> the signification of <span class="ital">fuel;</span> but the image is evidently much more lively and graphic when <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> is retained in its usual meaning: <span class="ital">forest.</span> Corresponding descriptions in Homer, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xi. 155.

Moffatt (<span class="ital">Expository Times</span>, xiv. p. 568) draws attention to Plutarch’s essay, <span class="ital">De Garrulitate</span>, 10, where the union of similar nautical and igneous metaphors (as in <a href="/context/james/3-4.htm" title="Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, wherever the governor wants....">Jam 3:4-6</a>) is found; “the moralist speaks first of speech as beyond control once it is uttered, like a ship which has broken loose from its anchorage. But in the following sentence, he comes nearer to the idea of James by quoting from a fragment of Euripides these lines:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Μικροῦ γὰρ ἐκ λαμπτῆρος Ἰδαῖον λέπας Πρήσειεν ἄν τις</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ πρὸς ἄνδρʼ εἰπὼν ἕνα</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Πύθοιντʼ ἂν ἀστοὶ πάντες</span>.”—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ μεγάλα αὐχεῖ</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. in N.T.; the same would apply to the alternative reading (see critical note above) <span class="greekheb">μεγαλαυχεῖ</span>. In <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/48-18.htm" title="In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against Sion, and boasted proudly.">Sir 48:18</a> we have, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐμεγαλαύχησεν ὑπερηφανίᾳ αὐτοῦ</span>. Mayor most truly remarks: “There is no idea of vain boasting, the whole argument turns upon the reality of the power which the tongue possesses”; this fully bears out what has been implied above, that this section has for its object the attempt to pacify the bitterness which had arisen in certain Synagogues of the Diaspora owing to controversies aroused by the harangues of various “teachers”.—<span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην ἀνάπτει</span>: at the risk of being charged with fancifulness the surmise may be permitted as to whether this picture was not suggested by the sight of an excited audience in some place of meeting; when an Eastern audience has been aroused to a high pitch, the noise of tongues, and gesticulation of the arms occasioned by the discussion following upon the oration which has been delivered, might most aptly be compared to a forest fire; the tongue of one speaker has set ablaze all the inflammable material which controversy brings into being. The possibility that the writer had something of this kind in his mind should not be altogether excluded.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνάπτει</span> occurs in the N.T. elsewhere only in <a href="/luke/12-49.htm" title="I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?">Luke 12:49</a>; Taylor (quoted by Mayor) says: “On fires kindled by the tongue see Midr. Rabb. on Lev. (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm" title="This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest:">Leviticus 14:2</a>) where the words are almost the same as those in St. James, <span class="ital">quanta incendia lingua excitat!</span>”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">and boasteth great things</span>] The Greek verb is a compound word, which does not occur elsewhere, but is used not unfrequently by Philo. The fact is not without interest, as indicating, together with the parallelisms just referred to, St James’s probable acquaintance with that writer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">how great a matter a little fire kindleth</span>] The form of the Greek is somewhat more emphatic. <span class="bld">A little fire kindles how great a mass of timber</span>. The word translated “matter” means primarily “a forest—wood in growth;” and with this meaning, which is adopted in the Vulgate “<span class="ital">silvam</span>”, the illustration would stand parallel to Homer’s simile:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“As when a spark scarce seen will set ablaze<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The illimitable forest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Iliad</span> ii. 455.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So in Virgil, <span class="ital">Georg</span>. ii. 303, we have a fuller description of the spark which, dropped at hazard, kindles the bark, and the branches, and the foliage:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“And as in triumph seizes on the boughs,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And reigns upon the throne of pine-tree tops,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And wraps the forest in a robe of flame.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word, however, had gradually passed into the hands of the metaphysicians, and like the Latin <span class="ital">materia</span>, which originally meant “timber” (a meaning still traceable in the name of Madeira, “the <span class="ital">well-timbered</span> island”), had come to mean matter as distinct from form, and then passing back, with its modified meaning, into common use, had been used for a pile, or heap of stuff, or materials of any kind. On the whole then, while admitting the greater vividness of the Homeric similitude, St James is likely to have meant a mass of materials rather than a forest. Comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm" title="An ungodly man digs up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.">Proverbs 16:27</a>, and <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/28-10.htm" title="As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed.">Sir 28:10</a>, where we have exactly the same comparison. The Authorised Version may be accordingly received as not far wrong. Here again it may be noted that Philo employs the same similitude to illustrate the growth of goodness in the soul: “As the smallest spark will, if duly fanned, kindle a vast pyre, so is the least element of virtue capable of growth till the whole nature of the man glows with a new warmth and brightness,” (Philo, <span class="ital">de Migr.

The compound verb of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is found in the LXX. (<a href="/ezekiel/16-50.htm">Ezekiel 16:50</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11</a>; 2 Macc. 15:32; Ecclus. 48:18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Third illustration.</span> A very small fire may kindle a very large forest. <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A2, B, C1, Vulgate) should be read instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (A1, C2, K, L, ff). It is equivalent to <span class="accented">quantulus as well as quantus. A</span> somewhat similar thought to the one before us is found in Ecclus. 11:32, "Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled." <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> "Matter," A.V.; "wood," R.V. The word is only found here in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is used for a "matter" of judgment in <a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>; "matter" in the philosophical sense in Wisd. 11:18. (cf. 15:13); the "matter" of a book in 2 Macc. 2:24; the "matter" of a fire in Ecclus. 28:10 (the whole passage, vers. 8-12, is wroth comparing with the one before us); and for "forest" in <a href="/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>. It is most natural to take it in this sense here (so Syriac and Vulgate, <span class="accented">silva</span>). "The literal meaning is certainly to be preferred to the philosophical" (Lightfoot on Revision, p. 140). Forest fires are frequently referred to by the ancients. Virgil's description of one ('Georgies,' 2:303) is well known; so also Homer's ('Iliad,' 11:155). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Boasteth great things (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>The best texts separate the compound, and read &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, of course with the same meaning. &#x391;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, boasteth, only here in New Testament.<p>How great a matter a little fire kindleth (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The word &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; (only here in New Testament) means wood or a forest, and hence the matter or raw material of which a thing is made. Later, it is used in the philosophical sense of matter -  "the foundation of the manifold"  - opposed to the intelligent or formative principle &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, mind. The authorized version has taken the word in one of its secondary senses, hardly the philosophical sense it would seem; but any departure from the earlier sense was not only needless, but impaired the vividness of the figure, the familiar and natural image of a forest on fire. So Homer:<p>"As when a fire<p>Seizes a thick-grown forest, and the wind<p>Drives it along in eddies, while the trunks<p>Fall with the boughs amid devouring flames."<p>Iliad, xi., 155.<p>Hence, Rev., rightly, "Behold how much wood or how great a forest is kindled by how small a fire.<p>This, too, is the rendering of the Vulgate: quam magnam silvam. </body></html>
