The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, we put bits in the horses" mouths ... - The meaning of this simple illustration is, that as we control a horse by the bit - though the bit is a small thing - so the body is controlled by the tongue. He who has a proper control over his tongue can govern his whole body, as he who holds a bridle governs and turns about the horse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Behold&#8212;The best authorities read, "but if," that is, Now whensoever (in the case) of horses (such is the emphatic position of "horses" in the Greek) we put the bits (so literally, "the customary bits") into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about also their whole body. This is to illustrate how man turns about his whole body with the little tongue. "The same applies to the pen, which is the substitute for the tongue among the absent" [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He illustrates the former proposition, that he that can rule his tongue may rule his whole body, by two similitudes: the first, of an unruly horse, which yet, as wanton as he is, being curbed in with a bit, may be easily managed; intimating, that even so, if a man’s tongue be well governed, the rest of the man will be under command. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths,.... By this, and the following simile, the apostle not only expresses the smallness of that member of the body, which is like the bit in the horse's mouth, and the helm of a ship, but the good use of it, and the great influence it has over the whole body. Horses are without understanding, and need direction in what path to go, and are strong, and would be truly and ungovernable unless bits and bridles were put into their mouths: <p>that they may obey us; and go in the way we would have them: <p>and we turn about the whole body of the horse, this way, and that way, as is thought best, by the help of the bit and bridle; and of such use is the tongue to the natural body, that being bridled itself, bridles, directs, and governs the whole body; and its influence on bodies, and societies of men, and Christians, is like that of the bit in the horse's mouth; who, like horses, would be unruly and ungovernable, were it not for the force of language, the power of words, and strength of argument. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span><p>(4) He shows by two comparisons, the one taken from the bridles of horses, the other from the rudder of ships, how great matters may be brought to pass by the good control of the tongue.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/3-3.htm" title="Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.">Jam 3:3</a>. <span class="ital">But if we put bridles in the mouths of horses, we turn also their whole body.</span> The clause <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅλον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. forms the apodosis to the protasis beginning with <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> (Pott, Wiesinger, Brückner, Lange, Bouman).

By <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἵππων</span> standing first, the view is at once directed to the object by which the sentiment expressed is to be illustrated (comp. <a href="/james/3-4.htm" title="Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, wherever the governor wants.">Jam 3:4</a>).

The <span class="ital">tertium comparationis</span> lies in <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ στόματα</span>; for, as Bengel correctly remarks: in <span class="ital">ore</span> lingua est, and <span class="greekheb">οὐ πταίειν ἐν λόγῳ</span>, is identical with the bridling of the tongue in the mouth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] Bede supplies: quanto amplius decet, ut nobis ipsis frenum continentiae in ora mittamus; Lorinus: si hoc in equis contingit, simile quid oportet circa linguam procurari; Hottinger: eodem modo qui linguam coercere potest, toti corpori facile moderabitur.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] Theile says: Ita a difficultate linguam moderandi transitus fit ad necessitatem: in memoriam vocatur, exigua saepe esse, quibus ingentia moveantur non solum in bonam (vv. 3, 4), sed maxime etiam in malam partem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/james/3-3.htm" title="Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body....">Jam 3:3-4</a>.

The examples adduced, which are closely attached to the preceding, are rather designed to prove how by the mastery of the tongue that of the whole body is possible; it is, James will say, even as one rules the horse by the guidance of the bridle, and the ship by the guidance of the helm. Only in the second image does the smallness of that by which the steersman rules the great ship appear to James as something important, so that he dwells upon this point in what follows (so also Lange).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/3-3.htm" title="Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.">Jam 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ</span>: this is the best attested reading, but see Mayor’s admirable note in favour of the reading <span class="greekheb">ἴδε γάρ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν ἵππων</span>: “The genitive is here put in an emphatic place to mark the comparison.

Therefore James in this first passage uses <span class="greekheb">ἴδε</span>; afterwards, he often uses <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ</span>, as he advances in strength. And one writer at least, in another place, uses both <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἴδε</span>, and that too in the short compass of a conversation; <a href="/john/12-15.htm" title="Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.">John 12:15</a>; <a href="/john/12-19.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.">John 12:19</a>; <a href="/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>; <a href="/john/16-32.htm" title="Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.">John 16:32</a>.[31] Not to enlarge further upon a matter of slight importance, I am satisfied with the reasons already alleged for the preference given by me to <span class="greekheb">ἴδε</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν ἵππων</span>, <span class="ital">of the horses</span>) This is emphatically put at the beginning of the sentence.—<span class="greekheb">στόματα</span>, <span class="ital">mouths</span>) This is an appropriate word; for the tongue is in the mouth.—<span class="greekheb">μετάγομεν</span>) <span class="ital">we turn about</span>.[32]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] <span class="greekheb">Εἰ δὲ</span> is the reading of AB Vulg.
