The apostle’s meaning is, both that the rich Jews pampered themselves every day, as the luxurious did on high festival-days; and that, by their luxury and lasciviousness, they had rendered themselves fit to be destroyed in the day of God’s wrath. <span class="ital">Ye have condemned and killed, </span><span class="greekheb">τον δικαιον</span>, <span class="ital">the Just One — </span>Many just men, and in particular that <span class="ital">Just One, </span>termed, (<a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>,) <span class="ital">the Holy One and Just. </span>They had killed Stephen, also, and they afterward killed James, the writer of this epistle, surnamed <span class="ital">the Just. </span>But the expression might be intended to comprehend all the righteous persons who were murdered by the Jews from first to last. <span class="ital">And he </span>— The Just One; <span class="ital">doth not resist you </span>— With that display of power which he can easily exert to your utter destruction, and therefore you are secure.

All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth - One of the things to which the rich are peculiarly addicted. Their wealth is supposed to be of value, because it furnishes them the means of doing it. Compare <a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>; <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>. The word translated "lived in pleasure, (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;  truphao&#772;) occurs only here in the New Testament. It means, to live delicately, luxuriously, at ease. There is not in the word essentially the idea or vicious indulgence, but that which characterizes those who live for enjoyment. They lived in ease and affluence on the avails of the labors of others; they indulged in what gratified the taste, and pleased the ear and the eye, while those who contributed the means of this were groaning under oppression. A life of mere indolence and ease, of delicacy and luxury, is nowhere countenanced in the Bible; and even where unconnected with oppression and wrong to others, such a mode of living is regarded as inconsistent with the purpose for which God made man, and placed him on the earth. See <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19-20</a>. Every man has high and solemn duties to perform, and there is enough to be done on earth to give employment to every human being, and to fill up every hour in a profitable and useful way.<p>And been wanton - This word now probably conveys to most minds a sense which is not in the original. Our English word is now commonly used in the sense of "lewd, lustful, lascivious." It was, however, formerly used in the sense of "sportive, joyous, gay," and was applied to anything that was variable or fickle. The Greek word used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;  spatalao&#772;) means, to live luxuriously or voluptuously. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>, where the word is explained. It does not refer necessarily to gross criminal pleasures, though the kind of living here referred to often leads to such indulgences. There is a close connection between what the apostle says here, and what he refers to in the previous verses - the oppression of others, and the withholding of what is due to those who labor. Such acts of oppression and wrong are commonly resorted to in order to obtain the means of luxurious living, and the gratification of sensual pleasures. In all countries where slavery exists, the things here referred to are found in close connection. The fraud and wrong by which the reward of hard toil is withheld from the slave is connected with indolence and sensual indulgence on the part of the master.<p>Ye have nourished your hearts - Or, yourselves - the word hearts here being equivalent to themselves. The meaning is, that they appeared to have been fattening themselves, like stall-fed beasts, for the day of slaughter. As cattle are carefully fed, and are fattened with a view to their being slaughtered, so they seemed to have been fattoned for the slaughter that was to come on them - the day of vengeance. Thus many now live. They do no work; they contribute nothing to the good of society; they are mere consumers - fruges, consumere nati; and, like stall-fed cattle, they seem to live only with reference to the day of slaughter, and to the recompense which awaits them after death.<p>As in a day of slaughter - There has been much variety in the interpretation of this expression. Robinson (lex.) renders it, "like beasts in the day of slaughter, without care or forethought." Rosenmuller (Morgenland) supposes that it means, as in a festival; referring, as he thinks, to the custom among the ancients of having a feast when a part of the animal was consumed in sacrifice, and the rest was eaten by the worshippers. So Benson. On such occasions, indulgence was given to appetite almost without limit; and the idea then would be, that they had given themselves up to a life of pampered luxury. But probably the more correct idea is, that they had fattened themselves as for the day of destruction; that is, as animals are fattened for slaughter. They lived only to eat and drink, and to enjoy life. But, by such a course, they were as certainly preparing for perdition, as cattle were prepared to be killed by being stall-fed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Translate, "Ye have luxuriated &#8230; and wantoned." The former expresses luxurious effeminacy; the latter, wantonness and prodigality.

This is said of other rich men; for all that is here said is not to be understood of the same individuals, but some things of one, and some of another; some made no use of their riches, either for themselves, or others; some did make use of them, and employed the poor, and then would not give them their wages; and others lived a voluptuous and luxurious life, indulged themselves in carnal lusts and pleasures, and gratified the senses by eating, drinking, gaming, and so were dead while they lived. The phrase suggests, that their pleasures were but short lived, but for a season, even while they were on earth; and that hereafter they would not live in pleasure: <p>and been wanton; through the abundance and plenty of good things, their delicious way of living, and the swing of pleasures which they took; the allusion is to fatted beasts, which being in good pastures, grow fat and wanton: <p>ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter, when beasts were slain for some extraordinary entertainment, or for the solemn festivals and sacrifices the Jews, when they lived more deliciously than at other times; and then the sense is, that these rich men fared sumptuously every day; every day was a festival with them; they indulged themselves in intemperance; they ate and drank, not merely what was necessary, and satisfying, and cheering to nature, but to excess, and gorged, and filled themselves in an extravagant manner: the Syriac version, instead of "hearts", reads "bodies" and one copy reads, "your flesh": and the last phrase may be rendered, as it is in the same version, "as unto", or "for the day of slaughter"; and so the Arabic version, "ye have nourished your hearts, as fattened for the day of slaughter": like beasts that are fattened in order to be killed, so were they preparing and fitting up by their sins for destruction. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> nourished your hearts, as in a <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> day of slaughter.</span><p>(b) You have pampered yourselves.<p>(c) The Hebrews call a day that is appointed to solemn banqueting, a day of slaughter or feasting.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/5-5.htm" title="You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.">Jam 5:5</a>.

Hottinger thus states the distinction between them: <span class="greekheb">τρυφᾷν</span> deliciarum est et exquisitae voluptatis; <span class="greekheb">σπαταλᾶν</span> luxuriae atque prodigalitatis; comp. the description of the rich man in <a href="/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>. These and the following verbs are in the aorist, not “because the conduct of the rich is described as viewed from the day of judgment” (1st ed. of this commentary; similarly also Wiesinger), for “this does not suit the present <span class="greekheb">ἀντιτάσσεται</span>” (Gunkel), but because James will mark the present conduct as a constant occurrence. The addition <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>] forms a sharp contrast to the preceding <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ ὦτα κυρίου σαβαώθ</span>. Whilst the Lord <span class="ital">in heaven</span> hears the complaints of the unjustly oppressed, the rich <span class="ital">on earth</span> enjoy their lusts, undisturbed by the wrath of God, which shall be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐθρέψατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν</span>] does not add a new idea to the preceding, but brings forward the fact that the rich in their luxurious living find the satisfaction of the desires of their heart. Luther’s translation: “Ye have pastured your heart,” does not sufficiently correspond to the idea <span class="greekheb">τρέφειν</span>; something bad is evidently denoted by it. Since <span class="greekheb">τρέφειν</span> is literally “to make firm, thick,” it is best here to render it by “to <span class="ital">satiate.</span>” Other expositors translate it by “to <span class="ital">fatten;</span> “Lange, by “to <span class="ital">make fat.</span>” <span class="greekheb">τὰς καρδίας</span> is equivalent neither to <span class="greekheb">τὰ σώματα ὑμῶν</span> nor to <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>; comp. <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>, and Meyer on that passage;[225] Winer, p. 141 [E.

Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">Jam 5:7</a>) and the judgment; so also Wiesinger, Brückner, Lange, only the latter arbitrarily understands by the day of slaughter, the day of Israel’s judgment, comprehending the time from the death of Christ to the destruction of Jerusalem. This designation of the day of judgment is also found in the O. T., particularly <a href="/jeremiah/12-3.htm" title="But you, O LORD, know me: you have seen me, and tried my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.">Jeremiah 12:3</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">ἅγνισον αὐτοὺς εἰς ἡμέραν σφαγῆς αὐτῶν</span>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm" title="Howl, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, you principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and you shall fall like a pleasant vessel.">Jeremiah 25:34</a>. By the reading <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφ</span>. a comparison occurs, namely, with the beasts who are to be slaughtered, so that Pott after <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> directly supplies <span class="greekheb">θρέμματα</span>. De Wette explains it: “Ye have pastured your hearts as in the day of slaughter; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> according to the comparison with beasts, who on the day on which they are to be slaughtered feed carelessly and devour greedily;” so also Bouman. But the idea “carelessly and greedily” is introduced; also the comparison is unsuitable, since beasts on the day of slaughter do not eat more greedily than on other days. Other expositors, as Wolf, Augusti, Hottinger, and others, take <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>; Hottinger: corpora vestra aluistis, tanquam pecora, quae saginari solent ad mactationem; but this change of prepositions is arbitrary. Several expositors, as Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Laurentius, Bengel, and others, understand by <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα σφαγῆς</span> <span class="ital">the day of sacrifice;</span> Calvin: addit similitudinem, sicut etc., quia solebant in sacrificiis solemnibus liberalius vesci. quam pro quotidiano more; the meaning then is: tota vita vestra est quasi perpetuum epulum ac festum continuum (Laurentius); but that expression never elsewhere occurs in <span class="ital">this</span> signification. Had James thought on the sacrificial feast or the like, he would have expressed it more definitely; besides, by this explanation the reference to the judgment is entirely awanting, and only the luxurious life is described; but this contradicts the character of the whole section, for if James, from <a href="/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">Jam 5:4</a> onwards, assigns the reason of <span class="greekheb">ταλαιπωρίαι</span>, he does this not without an earnest pointing to the judgment and its nearness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[225] Meyer: “The heart is filled with food, inasmuch as the sensation of being filled, the pleasant feeling of satisfaction, is in the heart.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/5-5.htm" title="You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.">Jam 5:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐτρυφήσατε</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. in N.T.; it occurs in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/14-4.htm" title="He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously.">Sir 14:4</a> for the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">בוע</span>,[59] which means “to revel,” followed by <span class="greekheb">ב</span>.

These expressions—“day of slaughter” and “valley of slaughter”—belong to Jeremiah (<span class="ital">Enoch</span>, xvi. 1 quotes the expression <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπὸ ἡμέρας καιροῦ σφαγῆς</span>), and in using the words “day of slaughter” the writer of our Epistle is undoubtedly giving them the meaning that they had originally; the passage before us probably means that these luxurious livers will be revelling in self-indulgence on the very day of judgment, <span class="ital">cf.</span> our Lord’s words in <a href="/luke/17-27.htm" title="They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.">Luke 17:27</a> ff., “They ate, they drank … and the flood came and destroyed them all … after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed”. The tense <span class="greekheb">ἐθρέψατε</span> is in accordance with Hebrew usage of regarding a thing in the future as having already taken place; it is wholly in the prophetic style.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] This is not <span class="ital">biblical</span> Hebrew, which would be התענג (<a href="/isaiah/66-11.htm" title="That you may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.">Isaiah 66:11</a>), or התעזן (<a href="/nehemiah/9-25.htm" title="And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells dig, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.">Nehemiah 9:25</a>); בוע occurs in the Targums, but means there “to shout for joy”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Ye lived luxuriously</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">spent wantonly</span>, the latter word emphasising the lavish and profligate expenditure by which the luxury which the former expresses was maintained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter</span>] Many of the best MSS. omit the particle of comparison, <span class="bld">ye nourished your heart in the day of slaughter</span>. With this reading, the “day of slaughter” is that of the carnage and bloodshed of war, such a “sacrifice” as that which the Lord of Hosts had, of old, by the river Euphrates (<a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm" title="For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.">Jeremiah 46:10</a>), or the “great slaughter” in the land of Idumæa (<a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm" title="The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.">Isaiah 34:6</a>). The “rich men” of Judæa, in their pampered luxury, were but fattening themselves, all unconscious of their doom, as beasts are fattened, for the slaughter. The insertion of the particle of comparison suggests a different aspect of the same thought. A sacrifice was commonly followed by a sumptuous feast upon what had been offered. Comp. the union of the two thoughts in the harlot’s words (“I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows”) in <a href="/proverbs/7-14.htm" title="I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.">Proverbs 7:14</a>. Taking this view St James reproaches the self-indulgent rich with making their life one long continuous feast. The former interpretation seems preferable, both on critical and exegetical grounds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/5-5.htm" title="You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.">Jam 5:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐτρυφήσατε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have lived in pleasure</span>) with specious delights, which you have supported from that very hire.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>, <span class="ital">on the earth</span>) now about to be laid waste.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐσπαταλήσατε</span>, <span class="ital">and ye have been wanton</span>) with luxury, sordid and mad, and wasting yourselves. Luxury (<span class="greekheb">τρυφὴ</span>) produces wantonness (<span class="greekheb">σπατάληι</span>); and wantonness is closely joined to slaughter (<span class="greekheb">τῇ σφαγῇ</span>). James describes together the pleasure and the cruelty of the rich, as is suitable to the gradation.—<span class="greekheb">ὠς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς</span>, <span class="ital">as in the day of slaughter</span>) An adage. <span class="ital">The slaughter</span> here intended is not that of the rich, but of oxen and sheep, etc., for banquets.
