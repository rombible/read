Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the prayer of faith - The prayer offered in faith, or in the exercise of confidence in God. It is not said that the particular form of the faith exercised shall be that the sick man will certainly recover; but there is to be unwavering confidence in God, a belief that he will do what is best, and a cheerful committing of the cause into his hands. We express our earnest wish, and leave the case with him. The prayer of faith is to accompany the use of means, for all means would be ineffectual without the blessing of God.<p>Shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up - This must be understood, as such promises are everywhere, with this restriction, that they will be restored to health if it shall be the will of God; if he shall deem it for the best. It cannot be taken in the absolute and unconditional sense, for then, if these means were used, the sick person would always recover, no matter how often he might be sick, and he need never die. The design is to encourage them to the use of these means with a strong hope that it would be effectual. It may fairly be inferred from this statement:<p>(1) that there would be cases in large numbers where these means would be attended with this happy result; and,<p>(2) that there was so much encouragement to do it that it would be proper in any case of sickness so make use of these means.<p>It may be added, that no one can demonstrate that this promise has not been in numerous instances fulfilled. There are instances, not a few, where recovery from sickness seems to be in direct answer to prayer, and no one can prove that it is not so. Compare the case of Hezekiah, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-1.htm">Isaiah 38:1-5</a>.<p>And if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him - Perhaps there may be a particular allusion here to sins which may have brought on the sickness as a punishment. In that case the removal of the disease in answer to prayer would be an evidence that the sin was pardoned. Compare <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>. But the promise may be understood in a more general sense as denoting that such sickness would be the means of bringing the sins of the past life to remembrance, especially if the one who was sick had been unfaithful to his Christian vows; and that the sickness in connection with the prayers offered would bring him to true repentance, and would recover him from his wanderings. On backsliding and erring Christians sickness often has this effect; and the subsequent life is so devoted and consistent as to show that the past unfaithfulness of him who has been afflicted is forgiven.<p>This passage <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a> is important, not only for the counsel which it gives to the sick, but because it has been employed by the Roman Catholic communion as almost the only portion of the Bible referred to to sustain one of the peculiar rites of their religion - that of "extreme unction" - a "sacrament," as they suppose, to be administered to those who are dying. It is of importance, therefore, to inquire more particularly into its meaning. There can be but three views taken of the passage:<p>I. That it refers to a miraculous healing by the apostles, or by other early ministers of religion who were endowed with the power of healing diseases in this manner. This is the interpretation of Doddridge, Macknight, Benson, and others. But to this view the objections seem to me to be insuperable.<p>(a) Nothing of this kind is said by the apostle, and this is not necessary to be supposed in order to a fair interpretation of the passage.<p>(b) The reference, as already observed, is clearly not to the apostles, but to the ordinary officers of the church - for such a reference would be naturally understood by the word presbyters; and to suppose that this refers to miracles, would be to suppose that this was a common endowment of the ordinary ministers of religion. But there was no promise of this, and there is no evidence that they possessed it. In regard to the extent of the promise, "they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover," see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17-18</a>.<p>(c) If this referred to the power of working miracles, and if the promise was absolute, then death would not have occurred at all among the early disciples. It would have been easy to secure a restoration to health in any instance where a minister of religion was at hand,<p>II. It is supposed by the Roman Catholics to give sanction to the practice of "extreme unction," and to prove that this was practiced in the primitive church. But the objections to this are still more obvious.<p>(a) It was not to be performed at death, or in the immediate prospect of death, but in sickness at any time. There is no hint that it was to be only when the patient was past all hope of recovery, or in view of the fact that he was to die. But "extreme unction," from its very nature, is to be practiced only where the patient is past all hope of recovery.<p>(b) It was not with a view to his death, but to his living, that it was to be practiced at all. It was not that he might be prepared to die, but that he might be restored to health - "and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up." But "extreme unction" can be with no such reference, and no such hope. It is only with the expectation that the patient is about to die; and if there were any expectation that he would be raised up even by this ordinance, it could not be administered as "extreme unction."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. prayer&#8212;He does not say the oil shall save: it is but the symbol.<p>save&#8212;plainly not as Rome says, "save" the soul. but heal "the sick": as the words, "the Lord shall raise him up," prove. So the same Greek is translated, "made (thee) whole," Mt 9:21, 22.<p>and if &#8230; sins&#8212;for not all who are sick are so because of some special sins. Here a case is supposed of one visited with sickness for special sins.<p>have committed&#8212;literally, "be in a state of having committed sins," that is, be under the consequences of sins committed.<p>they&#8212;rather, "it": his having committed sins shall be forgiven him. The connection of sin and sickness is implied in Isa 33:24; Mt 9:2-5; Joh 5:14. The absolution of the sick, retained in the Church of England, refers to the sins which the sick man confesses (Jas 5:16) and repents of, whereby outward scandal has been given to the Church and the cause of religion; not to sins in their relation to God, the only Judge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the prayer of faith; </span> i.e. proceeding from faith; the cure is ascribed to prayer, the moral means, and standing ordinance, not to the anointing, which was but ceremonial and temporary; and to faith in prayer, to show that this remedy was effectual only when faith (requisite to the working of miracles) was active, viz. in a certain persuasion that the sick person should be healed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall save the sick; </span> restore to health, (if God see it fit, and the health of the body be good for the soul), <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/10-52.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole.

This is correct; it is, however, to be observed that James has certainly supposed as self-evident the prayer of the sick man who called the elders. The following words: <span class="greekheb">σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα</span>, state the effect of the prayer of the presbyters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν κάμνοντα</span>] takes up again <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενεῖ τις</span>. <span class="greekheb">κάμνειν</span>, in the N.

T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A particular case is added to the general. <span class="greekheb">κἂν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς</span>] <span class="greekheb">κἄν</span> is not, as is done by most expositors, but against linguistic usage,[243] to be resolved by <span class="ital">and if</span>, but by <span class="ital">even if</span> (so also Lange). By the sins here meant are such as formed the special reason of the sickness. Accordingly, the meaning is: even if he has drawn his sickness upon himself by special sins (unsatisfactorily Lange: “if his sickness has become by them very severe”). By <span class="greekheb">ᾖ πεποιηκώς</span> the effect of the sins is represented as existing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apodosis <span class="greekheb">ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ</span> expresses that even in this case the healing will not fail. The forgiveness of sins is here meant, which is confirmed by the removal of the special punishment produced by the particular sins. The explanation of Hammond is evidently entirely erroneous: non tarn a Deo, quam a Presbyteris, qui aegroto peccata ipsis confitenti … absolutionem dare tenentur. As regards the construction of the sentence, <span class="greekheb">κἂν πεποιηκώς</span> may be joined to what goes before, and <span class="greekheb">ἀφεθήσεται</span> considered as an asyndeton addition: <span class="ital">and the Lord will raise him up, even if he has committed sins</span> … (<span class="ital">for</span>) <span class="ital">it will be forgiven him.</span> But the usual construction, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀφεθήσεται</span> is simply the apodosis to <span class="greekheb">κἂν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is to be preferred on account of the close connection of ideas; thus: <span class="ital">even if he hath committed, sins, it will be forgiven him;</span> by which the idea is included in <span class="greekheb">ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ</span>, that he will be healed of his sickness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ πεποιηκέναι</span> is to be supplied from the preceding to <span class="greekheb">ἀφεθήσεται</span> (Bengel, Theile, Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The promise (<span class="greekheb">σώσει</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐγερεῖ</span>) so positively expressed by James is founded on his confidence in the Lord, who hears believing intercession, so that it is not in vain. It is certainly surprising that James gives this assurance without any restriction. Although we cannot say, with Hottinger: si certus et constans talium precum fuisset eventus, nemo unquam mortuns esset, since the nature of the condition, on which James makes the event dependent, is not considered; on the one hand, it is self-evident that true <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> includes the humble <span class="greekheb">πλὴν οὐχ ὡς ἐγὼ θέλω ἀλλʼ ὡς σύ</span> (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>); and, on the other hand, it is to be observed that although James here evidently speaks of bodily sickness and its cure, yet he uses such expressions as point beyond the sphere of the corporeal to the spiritual, so that even when the result corresponds not to the expectation in reference to the bodily sickness, yet the prayer of faith does not remain unanswered in the higher sense.[244]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[243] In no passage of the N. T., except perhaps <a href="/luke/13-9.htm" title="And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.">Luke 13:9</a>, is the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in <span class="greekheb">κἄν</span> the simple copula uniting two sentences, but it has everywhere the meaning <span class="ital">though, even.</span> The N.

That sin brings disease was, likewise in the later Jewish literature, an article of faith, indeed here one finds specified what are the particular sicknesses that particular sins bring in their train. According to Rabbinical teaching there are four signs by means of which it is possible to recognise the sin of which a man has been guilty: dropsy is the sign that the sin of fornication has been committed, jaundice that of unquenchable hatred, poverty and humiliation that of pride, liver complaint (?) (<span class="greekheb">אסכרה</span>) that of back-biting. In <span class="ital">Shabbath</span>, 55 <span class="ital">a</span>, it says: “No death without sin, no chastisement without evil-doing,” and in <span class="ital">Nedarim</span>, 41 <span class="ital">a</span> it says: “No recovery without forgiveness”.

So Peter said to Æneas, “Jesus Christ maketh thee whole” (<a href="/acts/9-34.htm" title="And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed.

Repentance, it is obvious, is presupposed as a condition, and the love of God in Christ as the fountain of forgiveness, but the prayer of the elders of the Church is, beyond question, represented as instrumental, as helping to win for the sinner the grace both of repentance and forgiveness. It is noticeable that the remission of sins thus promised is dependent not on the utterance of the quasi-judicial formula of the <span class="ital">Absolvo te</span> (that, indeed, was not used at all until the 13th century) by an individual priest, but on the prayer of the elders as representing the Church. Comp. <a href="/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>, where also the promise is in the plural, “Whosesoever sins <span class="ital">ye</span> remit.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/5-15.htm" title="And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.">Jam 5:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως</span>, <span class="ital">the prayer of faith</span>) [<span class="ital">He does not say</span> the oil <span class="ital">shall save</span>.—V. g.] When some of the faithful pray, the whole power of faith is spread and exercised through the whole body of the Church.

Literally the words read, if he be having committed sins; i.e., in a state of having committed, and under the moral or physical consequences of transgression.<p>They shall be forgiven (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, Rev., "it shall be forgiven," supplying the commission as a subject. The verb means to send forth or discharge, and is the standard New-Testament word for forgiving. Forgiveness (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) is a putting or sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of the sinner; thus differing from &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), which is a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a remission.
