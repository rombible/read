The heathen philosopher Solon called no one “happy” upon earth; but, with the mystery of pain around him, cried sadly, “Look to the end.” And the sated and weary soul of Solomon had no better thought than to praise “the dead which are already dead, more than the living” (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm" title="Why I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>). How different the teaching of St. James, himself taught by the example of the suffering Christ: verily, “he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than” the greatest and the wisest who know not of its light and peace (<a href="/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The patience of</span> <span class= "bld">Job.</span>—The earliest notions current in the world were, doubtless, that on the whole prosperity came to those who lived morally and physically well, while adversity in body or mind followed closely on the wicked and improvident. It is easy to see how these opinions, even among the happier races who had not wandered far from God, gradually hardened into stern rules of judgment, by which each man saw in the chances and calamities of life an immediate effort of an avenging Deity. This was ages before a pious Asaph (Psalms 73) could reflect on the contradiction of experience in this matter, and be troubled at the “prosperity” of the wicked; or before the wise king could notice (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm" title="There is a vanity which is done on the earth; that there be just men, to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) the just man perishing “in his righteousness,” and the unjust prolonging “his days in wickedness”; “the fishes taken in an evil net,” and “the birds caught in the snare” (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm" title="For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>). It was ages earlier still than the presence of that Wiser than Solomon, who spoke of the hapless “eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell”—“Think ye that they were sinners above all?” (<a href="/context/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4-5</a>). Job’s friends were so certain of his misdeeds, that they would not hear his self-defence; if God tried his endurance, man surely afflicted his patience. We can hear the three in council against him, becoming more zealous as they believe themselves the defenders of God’s justice. (See Job 4-22) They are shocked at Job’s obstinacy, and annoyed into vehement accusation against him, because he will “hold fast” to his “integrity.” It is a damning proof to them of his guilt. Not only had he been wicked, but now actually he is impious and rebellious; such conduct is not to be borne. “Is not thy wickedness great?” says Eliphaz (<a href="/job/22-5.htm" title="Is not your wickedness great? and your iniquities infinite?">Job 22:5</a>). Thou must have—nay, “thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing;” thou couldst not—nay, “thou hast not given water to the weary, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry:” truly thine iniquities are infinite.” Now, we know Job was innocent; God Himself bears witness to it (<a href="/job/1-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?">Job 1:8</a>). And finally the suffering, patient, righteous man was declared to have spoken wisely: as Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar the contrary. They—types of a censorious piety—had conceived of God by their own faulty notions of religion, and fondly deemed they could enter into the motives of the Most High. Job for awhile had seemed to cloud his own belief with baser attributes, as (Job 16 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) to a God who causelessly dealt in cruelty and pain; but through such fleeting mistakes he rose at last to the full conviction of His perfect truth and justice. It might be that He gave happiness to those who sought Him; it might be He allowed them misery—as the world would call it; but this nor that had part in the matter at issue. Earthly blessings “He gives to whom He wills, or leaves to the powers of nature to distribute among those who fulfil the laws” thereof; but “to serve him and love Him is higher and better than any mundane welfare, though it be with wounded feet and bleeding forehead, or an ash-heap and filthy sores” (Froude). This was the faith to which Job attained: higher, “clearer, purer, there is not possible to man.” In such like “patience” it were well for us that we should “possess our souls” (<a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And have seen</span> <span class= "bld">the end of the Lord.</span>—Better thus, <span class= "ital">Ye have heard</span> . . . <span class= "ital">see also the end of the Lord.</span> The reference is at once past and future: consider, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>what God wrought in the end of trial, on the faithful of old time, like Job; learn from it how great a deliverance He will also work for you.

If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, we count them happy which endure - The word rendered "we count them happy" (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  makarizomen,) occurs only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>, where it is rendered "shall call me blessed." The word &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  makarios (blessed, or happy,) however, occurs often. See <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-11</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-6.htm">Matthew 11:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-6.htm">Matthew 13:6</a>, et soepe. The sense here is, we speak of their patience with commendation. They have done what they ought to do, and their name is honored and blessed.<p>Ye have heard of the patience of Job - As one of the most illustrious instances of patient sufferers. See <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. The book of Job was written, among other reasons, to show that true religion would bear any form of trial to which it could be subjected. See <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5-6</a>.<p>And have seen the end of the Lord - That is, the end or design which the Lord had in the trials of Job, or the result to which he brought the case at last - to wit, that he showed himself to be very merciful to the poor sufferer; that he met him with the expressions of his approbation for the manner in which he bore his trials; and that he doubled his former possessions, and restored him to more than his former happiness and honor. See <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13.htm">Job 13</a>. Augustine, Luther, Wetstein, and others, understand this as referring to the death of the Lord Jesus, and as meaning that they had seen the manner in which he suffered death, as an example for us. But, though this might strike many as the true interpretation, yet the objections to it are insuperable.<p>(1) it does not accord with the proper meaning of the word "end," (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  telos). That word is in no instance applied to "death," nor does it properly express death. It properly denotes an end, term, termination, completion; and is used in the following senses: - <p>(a) To denote the end, the termination, or the last of anything, <a href="/mark/3-26.htm">Mark 3:26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a>;<p>(b) An event, issue, or result, <a href="/matthew/26-58.htm">Matthew 26:58</a>; <a href="/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-18.htm">2 Corinthians 11:18</a>;<p>(c) The final purpose, that to which all the parts tend, and in which they terminate, <a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>;<p>(d) Tax, custom, or tribute - what is paid for public ends or purposes, <a href="/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>; <a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>.<p>(2) this interpretation, referring it to the death of the Saviour, would not accord with the remark of the apostle in the close of the verse, "that the Lord is very merciful." That is, what he says was "seen," or this was what was particularly illustrated in the ease referred to. Yet this was not particularly seen in the death of the Lord Jesus. He was indeed most patient and submissive in his death, and it is true that he showed mercy to the penitent malefactor; but this was not the particular and most prominent trait which he evinced in his death. Besides, if it had been, that would not have been the thing to which the apostle would have referred here. His object was to recommend patience under trials, not mercy shown to others; and this he does by showing:<p>(a) That Job was an eminent instance of it, and,<p>(b) That the result was such as to encourage us to be patient.<p>The end or the result of the divine dealings in his case was, that the Lord was "very pitiful and of tender mercy;" and we may hope that it will be so in our case, and should therefore be encouraged to be patient under our trials.<p>That the Lord is very pitiful - As he showed deep compassion in the case of Job, we have equal reason to suppose that he will in our own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. count them happy&#8212;(Mt 5:10).<p>which endure&#8212;The oldest authorities read, "which have endured," which suits the sense better than English Version: "Those who in past days, like the prophets and Job, have endured trials."

How long Job endured the chastenings of the Lord cannot be said.

Some understand this of the Lord Jesus Christ, both of his great patience in sufferings, in which he is an example to his people, and they would do well to look to, and consider him; and of the end of his sufferings, his glorious resurrection from the dead, and session at the right hand of God, where he is crowned with glory and honour; but the former sense is best: <p>that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy; as to Job, so to all his people; his paternal relation to them engages his pity towards them; nor does he willingly afflict them; and when he does, he sympathizes with them; he is afflicted with them, and in his pity redeems them; his heart moves towards them, and he earnestly remembers them, and works deliverance for them in his own time and way; and therefore it becomes them to be patient. <p>(y) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 3. p. 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, we count them happy which endure.

By the reading <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ὑπομένοντας</span> the idea is to be taken quite generally; whereas by the better attested reading <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ὑπομείναντας</span> it is to be limited to sufferers of the past time; the latter is more in conformity with the context (Wiesinger). The “restricted reference” to <span class="greekheb">τοὺς προφήτας</span> (Grotius, Baumgarten, Pott, Hottinger, Theile) is not to be justified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑπομόνην Ἰὼβ ἠκούσατε</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὑπομόνη</span> is not = perpessio (Storr), but the patience which Job displayed both in his afflictions and in his replies to the contradictions of his friends; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/2-12.htm" title="And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid....">Tob 2:12-14</a> (Vulg.; the text in the Greek ed.

Others, as Augustin, Bede, Lyra, Estius, Thomas, Pareus, Wetstein, Lange, assume that by <span class="greekheb">τέλος κυρίου</span> the death of Christ is to be understood. Against this is not only the concluding clause, but also the context, which points to the end to which the pious sufferer is brought by the mercy of God, and on account of which he is accounted happy; apart altogether from the improbability that James should connect the example of Christ immediately with that of Job.[234]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the reading <span class="greekheb">εἴδετε</span> this can only be understood of “indirect seeing, namely, of clear perception by hearing” (de Wette). The better attested reading, however, is <span class="greekheb">ἴδετε</span>, and it can only be regarded as an oversight that Wiesinger translates this <span class="greekheb">ἴδετε</span> by “audiendo cognovistis,” as it is not the indicative, but the imperative. The imperative is here certainly surprising, and was on that account changed into the indicative. Tischendorf has connected <span class="greekheb">ἴδετε</span> with what goes before, and then it is to be explained: <span class="ital">Ye have heard of the patience of Job, look also at the end which the Lord gave.</span> The connection with what follows would, however, be more suitable: <span class="ital">Ye have heard of the patience of Job and the end which the Lord gave; see</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> recognise from this) <span class="ital">that the Lord is</span> <span class="greekheb">πολύσπλαγχνος</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="greekheb">οἰκτίρμων</span>.

For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, <a href="/job/5-13.htm" title="He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the fraudulent is carried headlong.">Job 5:13</a>), this is the only reference in the New Testament to the history of Job. Philo, however, quotes from <a href="/job/14-4.htm" title="Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.">Job 14:4</a> (<span class="ital">de Mutat. Nom</span>. xxiv.), and he is referred to by Clement of Rome (1.17.26). The book would naturally be studied by one whose attention had been drawn, as St James’s manifestly had been, to the sapiential Books included in the Hagiographa of the Old Testament. It is obvious that he refers to the book as containing an actual history, as obvious that his so referring to it throws no light on the questions which have been raised, but which it would be out of place to discuss here, as to its authorship and date.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and have seen the end of the Lord</span>] The words have received two very different interpretations. (1) They have been referred to the “end” which the “Lord” wrought out for Job after his endurance had been tried, as in <a href="/job/42-12.htm" title="So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.">Job 42:12</a>. (2) The “end of the Lord” has been understood as pointing to the death and resurrection of Christ as the Lord who had been named in <a href="/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7</a>, the highest example of patience in the Old Testament being brought into juxtaposition with the Highest of all Examples. On this view the passage becomes parallel with <a href="/context/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully....">1 Peter 2:19-25</a>. The clause that follows is, however, decisively in favour of (1), nor is there any instance of a New Testament writer using the term “end” of the passion and death of Christ. <a href="/matthew/26-58.htm" title="But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.">Matthew 26:58</a>, which is the nearest approach to such a use, is scarcely in point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy</span>] The first of the two adjectives, of which the nearest English equivalent would be <span class="bld">large-hearted</span> or perhaps <span class="bld">tender-hearted</span>, is not found in any other writer, and may have been a coinage of St James’s. The latter occurs in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/2-11.htm" title="For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.">Sir 2:11</a>, in close juxtaposition with a passage which we have already found referred to in the Epistle (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/2-11.htm" title="For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.">Sir 2:11</a>), and which may therefore have been present to St James’s thoughts.

The distinction between this and &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, merciful, seems to be that the former denotes the general quality of compassion, while the latter emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, being the feeling which is moved to pain at another's suffering. </body></html>
