they are loathsome in God’s sight; the Divine anger has breathed upon them and blighted them; they are already withered and blasted.” (Comp. <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/james/5-2.htm" title="Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten....">James 5:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Your riches are corrupted </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">σεσηπε</span>, <span class="ital">are putrefied, </span>or are as things putrefied by being kept too long. The riches of the ancients consisted much in large stores of corn, wine, oil, and costly apparel. These things the rich men in Judea had amassed, like the foolish rich man mentioned <a href="/luke/12-18.htm" title="And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.">Luke 12:18</a>, little imagining that they would soon be robbed of them by the Roman soldiers, and the destructive events of the war. <span class="ital">Your garments </span>— In your wardrobes; <span class="ital">are moth-eaten </span>— The fashion of clothes not changing in the eastern countries as with us, persons of fortune used to have many garments made of different costly stuffs, which they laid up as a part of their wealth. Thus, according to Q. Curtius, (lib. 5. c. 6,) when Alexander took Persepolis, he found the riches of all Asia gathered together there, which consisted not only of gold and silver, but <span class="ital">vestis ingens modus, </span>a vast quantity of garments. <span class="ital">Your gold and silver is cankered </span>— Or eaten out with rust; <span class="ital">and the rust of them </span>— Your perishing stores and moth-eaten garments; <span class="ital">shall be, </span><span class="greekheb">εις μαρτυριον</span>, <span class="ital">for a testimony against you </span>— Of your covetousness and worldly mind; and of your having foolishly and wickedly buried those talents in the earth, which you ought to have employed, according to your Lord’s will, in relieving the wants of your fellow-creatures. <span class="ital">And shall eat your flesh as it were fire </span>— Will occasion you as great a torment as if fire were consuming your flesh. Or, as the rust eats into the gold and silver, so shall your flesh and wealth be eaten up as if you had treasured up fire in the midst of it. This was punctually fulfilled in the destruction of that nation by their own seditions, and their wars with the Romans. For, among the <span class="ital">Sicarii </span>and the <span class="ital">Zealots, </span>the ringleaders of all their seditions, it was crime enough to be rich; and their insatiable avarice induced them continually to <span class="ital">search into the houses of the rich, </span>and, by false accusation, to slay them as deserters, for the sake of their property. Yea, both their substance and their bodies were devoured by the flames which burned up the city and the temple: and if any thing remained, it became a prey to the Roman soldiers. <span class="ital">Ye have heaped treasure for the last days </span>— The days which are now coming, when your enemies shall seize or destroy all, to your infinite vexation and distress: or, you have heaped them up when it is too late; when you have no time or opportunity to enjoy them. This phrase, <span class="ital">the last days, </span>does not merely <span class="ital">signify for the time to come, </span>but for that period when the whole Jewish economy was to close, and when those awful judgments, threatened in the prophets to be poured out upon wicked men in the last days, were just coming.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, and are secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times. All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your riches are corrupted - The word here rendered "corrupted" (&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;  se&#772;po&#772;) does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means, to cause to rot, to corrupt, to destroy. The reference here is to their hoarded treasures; and the idea is, that they had accumulated more than they needed for their own use; and that, instead of distributing them to do good to others, or employing them in any useful way, they kept them until they rotted or spoiled. It is to be remembered, that a considerable part of the treasures which a man in the East would lay up, consisted of perishable materials, as garments, grain, oil, etc. Such articles of property were often stored up, expecting that they would furnish a supply for many years, in case of the prevalence of famine or wars. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18-19</a>. A suitable provision for the time to come cannot be forbidden; but the reference here is to cases in which great quantities had been laid up, perhaps while the poor were suffering, and which were kept until they became worthless.<p>Your garments are moth-eaten - The same idea substantially is expressed here in another form. As the fashions in the East did not change as they do with us, wealth consisted much in the garments that were laid up for show or for future use. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>. Q. Curtius says that when Alexander the Great was going to take Persepolis, the riches of all Asia were gathered there together, which consisted not only of a great abundance of gold and silver, but also of garments, Lib. vi. c. 5. Horace tells us that when Lucullus the Roman was asked if he could lend a hundred garments for the theater, he replied that he had five thousand in his house, of which they were welcome to take part or all. Of course, such property would be liable to be moth-eaten; and the idea here is, that they had amassed a great amount of this kind of property which was useless to them, and which they kept until it became destroyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. corrupted&#8212;about to be destroyed through God's curse on your oppression, whereby your riches are accumulated (Jas 5:4).

Their costly garments, in a great store of which the wealth of an Eastern largely consists, should become moth-eaten. Their gold and silver should be rusted. Bengel notes on this passage: "Scripta haec suut paucis annis ante obsidionem Hierosolymorum;" and certainly the best commentary upon it is to be found in the terrible account given by Josephus of the sufferings and miseries which came upon the Jews during the war and siege of Jerusalem.
