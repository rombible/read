Such a reference, however, has been disallowed by some commentators, as conveying too harsh an accusation against the whole Jewish people<span class= "ital">;</span> and besides, it being unfair to forget that St. James was writing to Christian Jews, as well as to the anti-Christian. But, in a manner, all wrong and oppression tend towards the murder of the Just One, as every falsehood (see Note on <a href="/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">James 3:13</a>) is an attack on the Truth. And far beyond this, in the present case our Lord is rightly to be considered the victim of the Jews. His blood is on them and on their children (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm" title="Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.">Matthew 27:25</a>); they filled up “the measure of their fathers” (<a href="/matthew/23-32.htm" title="Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.">Matthew 23:32</a>), that “the blood of all the righteous” might come upon them, from Abel to Zacharias (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>): the one crowning sin made them guilty of all. And not only is this backward participation true, but there is a forward one as well. Christ Himself was persecuted by Saul in the afflictions of His servants (<a href="/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-5</a>), and so onward ever till the martyr-roll be full.<p>It is of strange significance that in this verse—<span class= "ital">ye condemned, ye slew the just</span>—James the Just prophetically described his own murderers. The last words, moreover, of the Scripture, simply record the behaviour of himself, as of every real witness for Christ: <span class= "ital">He doth not resist. </span>No: “the servant of the Lord must not strive” (<a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm" title="And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,">2Timothy 2:24</a>) even in death; and by such meekness and resignation is best seen the likeness to the divine Master, Who “was brought as a lamb to the slaughter” (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>).

All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have condemned and killed the just - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ton dikaion - "the just one," or "the just man" - for the word used is in the singular number. This may either refer to the condemnation and crucifixion of Christ - meaning that their conduct towards his people had been similar to the treatment of the Saviour, and was in fact a condemnation and crucifixion of him afresh; or, that by their rejection of him in order to live in sin, they in fact condemned him and his religion; or, that they had condemned and killed the just man - meaning that they had persecuted those who were Christians; or, that by their harsh treatment of others in withholding what was due to them, they had deprived them of the means of subsistence, and had, as it were, killed the righteous. Probably the true meaning is, that it was one of their characteristics that they had been guilty of wrong towards good men. Whether it refers, however, to any particular act of violence, or to such a course as would wear out their lives by a system of oppression, injustice, and fraud, cannot now be determined.<p>And he doth not resist you - Some have supposed that this refers to God, meaning that he did not oppose them; that is, that he bore with them patiently while they did it. Others suppose that it should be read a question - "and doth he not resist you?" meaning that God would oppose them, and punish them for their acts of oppression and wrong. But probably the true reference is to the "just man" whom they condemned and killed; meaning that they were so powerful that all attempts to resist them would be vain, and that the injured and oppressed could do nothing but submit patiently to their acts of injustice and violence. The sense may be either that they could not oppose them - the rich men being so powerful, and they who were oppressed so feeble; or that they bore their wrongs with meekness, and did not attempt it. The sins, therefore, condemned in these verses <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1-6</a>, and for which it is said the divine vengeance would come upon those referred to, are these four:<p>(1) that of hoarding up money when it was unnecessary for their real support and comfort, and when they might do so much good with it, (compare <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>;)<p>(2) that of keeping back the wages which was due to those who cultivated their fields; that is, keeping back what would be a fair compensation for their toil - applicable alike to hired men and to slaves;<p>(3) that of giving themselves up to a life of ease, luxury, and sensual; indulgence; and,<p>(4) that of wronging and oppressing good and just men - men, perhaps in humble life, who were unable to vindicate their rights, and who had none to undertake their cause; men who were too feeble to offer successful resistance, or who were restrained by their principles from attempting it.<p>It is needless to say that there are multitudes of such persons now on the earth, and that they have the same reason to dread the divine vengeance which the same class had in the time of the apostle James. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Ye have condemned &#8230; the just&#8212;The Greek aorist expresses, "Ye are accustomed to condemn &#8230; the just." Their condemnation of Christ, "the Just," is foremost in James' mind. But all the innocent blood shed, and to be shed, is included, the Holy Spirit comprehending James himself, called "the Just," who was slain in a tumult. See my [2609]Introduction. This gives a peculiar appropriateness to the expression in this verse, the same "as the righteous (just) man" (Jas 5:16). The justice or righteousness of Jesus and His people is what peculiarly provoked the ungodly great men of the world.<p>he doth not resist you&#8212;The very patience of the Just one is abused by the wicked as an incentive to boldness in violent persecution, as if they may do as they please with impunity. God doth "resist the proud" (Jas 4:6); but Jesus as man, "as a sheep is dumb before the shearers, so He opened not His mouth": so His people are meek under persecution.

The singular is to be taken collectively, and the expression absolutely, as in <a href="/james/5-16.htm" title="Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.">Jam 5:16</a>. Several expositors assume that the verbs <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΕΔΙΚΆΣΑΤΕ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἘΦΟΝΕΎΣΑΤΕ</span></span></span>, are not meant in their literal sense; but evidently without reason. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΕΔΙΚΆΣΑΤΕ</span></span></span> shows that here primarily judges are meant; yet the accusers, if these are to be distinguished from them, are not to be considered as excluded, since their accusation points to nothing else than to a sentence of condemnation.[227] The asyndeton sharpens the climax, which is contained in the addition of the second verb to the first. Bouman directs attention to the paronomasia between <span class="greekheb">κατεδικάσατε</span> and <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται</span>] opposes the calm patience of the just to the violence of the wicked: <span class="ital">he doth not resist</span> (comp. <a href="/acts/18-6.htm" title="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.">Acts 18:6</a>; <a href="/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.

The present is explained from the fact that in what goes before not a single instance, but the continued conduct of the rich is described, and opposed to this is placed the similarly continued conduct of the <span class="greekheb">δίκαιοι</span>. Lange, by the reference of <span class="greekheb">τὸν δίκαιον</span> to Christ, misinterprets the force of the present, arbitrarily attributing to the verb the meaning: “He stands no longer in your way; He does not stop you (in the way of death); He suffers you to fill up your measure.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is unnecessary to supply in thought <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> or <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>; also <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται</span> is not to be converted into <span class="greekheb">οὐ δύναται ἀντιτάσσεσθαι</span> (Pott). For the correct construction there is no reason, with Bentley, for conjecturing <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, or, with Benson, to take the sentence as interrogative, and to supply <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span>. The object of the addition of the clause is not so much the more strongly to mark the violent conduct of the rich, as rather by implication to point to the proximity of the vengeance of God, who interests Himself in the suffering just, as is definitely asserted in the previous verses. With this verse are to be compared, besides the already cited passage in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-12.htm" title="Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education....">Wis 2:12-17</a>, particularly <a href="/context/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;...">Amos 2:6-7</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a> (<span class="greekheb">καταπατοῦντες δίκαιον</span>), <a href="/amos/8-4.htm" title="Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,">Amos 8:4</a>, which testify for the correctness of the explanation here given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[226] Oecumenius, indeed, says: <span class="greekheb">ἀναντιῤῥήτως τό</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐφον</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἑπὶ τὸν Χριστὸν ἀναφέρεται</span>; but he thinks that James likewise understands by this: <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἄλλους τοὺς τὰ ὅμοια παρὰ τῶν Ἰοιδαίων παθόντας</span>; and he closes with the remark: <span class="greekheb">ἴσως δε καὶ προφητικῶς τὸ περὶ ἐαυτὸν ὑπεμφαίνει πάθος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[227] Wiesinger correctly observes that <span class="greekheb">φονεύειν</span> is here not to be explained according to <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/31-21.htm" title="And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest.">Sir 31:21</a> : <span class="greekheb">φονεύων τον πλησιον ὁ ἀφαιρούμενος τὴν ἐμβίωσιν</span>; but he maintains without reason that the death of the just is not to be considered as the direct design of the <span class="greekheb">πλούσεοι</span>, but only as the result of their oppressions. Also de Wette thinks that the killing is not to be understood literally, but of extreme violence, deprivation of liberty, and the like. This interpretation is, however, occasioned by the assumption that the rich are Christians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/5-6.htm" title="You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.">Jam 5:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατεδικάσατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον</span>: this expresses what must often have taken place; the prophetical books often refer to like things; there is no reason for regarding this as some specific case of judicial murder. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/context/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;...">Amos 2:6-7</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-10.htm" title="Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.">Wis 2:10</a> ff. The antithesis between the <span class="greekheb">צדיק</span> (“righteous”) and <span class="greekheb">רשׁע</span> (“wicked”) is a commonplace in Jewish theology.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν</span>: the statement of fact here, instead of the interrogative as read by some authorities, is more natural, and more in accordance with the prophetical style which is so characteristic of this whole passage. This picture of patient acquiescence in ill-treatment is really a very vivid touch, for it shows, on the one hand, that the down-trodden realised the futility of resistance; on the other, that their hopes were centred on the time to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the whole of this section <span class="ital">cf.</span> the words in <span class="ital">The first book of Clement, which is called The Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>, 12: “The harvest is come, that the guilty may be reaped and the Judge appear suddenly and confront them with their works”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Ye have condemned and killed the just</span>] The words have been very generally understood as referring to the death of Christ, and on this view, the words “he doth not resist you” have been interpreted as meaning, “He no longer checks you in your career of guilt; He leaves you alone (comp. <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm" title="Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.">Hosea 4:17</a>) to fill up the measure of your sin.” St James, it has been inferred, uses the term “the Just One” as Stephen had done (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>), as pointing emphatically to “Jesus Christ the righteous” (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>). Fuller consideration, however, shews that such a meaning could hardly have come within the horizon of St James’s thoughts. (1) That single evil act of priests, and scribes, and the multitude of Jerusalem, could hardly have been thus spoken of in an Epistle addressed to the Twelve Tribes of the dispersion, without a more distinct indication of what was referred to. To see in them, as some have done, the statement that the Jews, wherever they were found, were guilty of that crime, as accepting and approving it, or as committing sins which made such an atonement necessary, is to read into them a non-natural meaning. (2) The whole context leads us to see in the words, a generic evil, a class sin, characteristic, like those of the previous verse, of the rich and powerful everywhere. (3) The meaning thus given to “he doth not resist you” seems, to say the least, strained and unnatural, especially as coming so soon after the teaching (ch. <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">James 4:6</a>) which had declared that “God does <span class="ital">resist</span> the proud.” (4) The true meaning of both clauses is found, it is believed, in taking “the just” as the representative of a class, probably of the class of those, who as disciples of Christ the Just One, were reproducing His pattern of righteousness. Such an one, like his Master, and like Stephen, St James adds, takes as his law (note the change of tense from past to present) the rule of not resisting. He submits patiently, certain that in the end he will be more than conqueror. It is not without interest to note that that title was afterwards applied to St James himself (Euseb. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> ii. 23). The name Justus, which appears three times in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>), was obviously the Latin equivalent of this epithet, and it probably answered to the <span class="ital">Chasidim</span> or Assideans (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-42.htm" title="Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.">1Ma 2:42</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-13.htm" title="Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:">1Ma 7:13</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-6.htm" title="Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.">2Ma 14:6</a>) of an earlier stage of Jewish religious history. It is as if a follower of George Fox had addressed the judges and clergy of Charles II.’s reign, and said to them, “Ye persecuted <span class="ital">the Friend</span>, and he does not resist you.” (5) It is in favour of this interpretation that it presents a striking parallel to a passage in the “Wisdom of Solomon,” with which this Epistle has so many affinities. There too the writer speaks of the wealthy and voluptuous as laying snares for “the just” who is also “poor,” who calls himself “the <span class="bld">servant</span> of the Lord,” and boasts of God as his Father (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-12.htm" title="Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education....">Wis 2:12-16</a>). Comp. also the description of the ultimate triumph of the just man in. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-1.htm" title="Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours....">Wis 5:1-5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/5-6.htm" title="You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.">Jam 5:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατεδικάσατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐφονεύσατε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have condemned, ye have killed</span>) The omission of the conjunction expresses haste.[68] Compare again App. Crit. Ed. ii. I feel grateful to <span class="ital">Baumgarten</span>; for while he brings forward no reading more worthy of remark, as omitted by me, he remarkably confirms the fulness of my choice.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν δίκαιον</span>, <span class="ital">the Just</span>) A distributive meaning in the singular number is admissible, denoting any just person, as the wicked get each into their power; but especially Christ Himself, <span class="ital">the Just One</span>, <a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>, who was slain by Jews and Gentiles; and afterwards James, the writer of this Epistle, who was surnamed by the Hebrews the <span class="ital">Just</span>, whose slaughter is here divinely foretold. The present tense is suitable, <span class="ital">He doth not resist you</span>; by which clause, following as it does without a conjunction, it is likewise intimated that by the very patience of the Just One the wicked goad themselves to slaughter. Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-10.htm" title="Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged....">Wis 2:10-20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Cod.

At first sight it may well seem so. Compare St. Peter's words in <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>, "Ye denied the Holy One and the Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" St. Stephen's in <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>, "the coming of the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" and St. Paul's in <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>, "to see the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." But this view is dispelled when we remember how throughout this whole passage the ideas and expressions are borrowed from the Old Testament, and when we find that in <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a> (LXX.) the wicked are represented as saying, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> passage which lies at the root of the remarkable section in Wisd. 2, "Let us oppress the poor righteous man .... Let us condemn him with a shameful death." It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used to denote the class collectively (cf. <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>). It is a remarkable coincidence, pointed out by most commentators, that he who wrote these verses, himself styled <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the Jews, suffered death at their hands a very few years afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">He doth not resist you.</span> According to the view commonly adopted, St. James simply means to say that the righteous man suffered this evil at their hands without resistance. Another interpretation seems more possible, taking the clause as interrogative, "Does he not resist you?" the subject, implied but not expressed, being God; as if he would say, "Is not God against you? " - that God of whom it has already been said that he <span class="accented">resists</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the proud (comp. <a href="/hosea/1-6.htm">Hosea 1:6</a>, "I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly take them away (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)") </body></html>
