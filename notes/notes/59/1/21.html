The superabundance—the overgrowth—of evil will occupy the heart, if care be not taken to root it out; and, like the thorns in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-7.htm" title="And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:">Matthew 13:7</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>spring up and choke the good seed.

The term is peculiar to this place, and means “innate” in its first intention. If taken so, “the innate Word” will be Christ Himself formed within us. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Able to save your souls.</span>—In like manner Paul at Miletus commends the elders of Ephesus “to God, and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified” (<a href="/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>). Observe, the idea of salvation thus conveyed by the implanted word, is so potentially and not actually. Tended and cultured, it will grow into a tree of life, the fruit whereof may heal the wounds of sin; but the after-growth of this plant of God is largely in the hands of man.<p>We can hardly help making a brief inquiry in this place on the meaning of “soul.” There are few words more vaguely used by devout persons, or which present greater difficulties to the learned, or open wider fields of speculation for the thoughtful. In common language we speak of “body and soul,” meaning much the same as “body and spirit;” but theologians write more carefully of “body, soul, and spirit” (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>); and psychologists distinguish between the animal branch of their subject and the rational or intellectual (<span class= "greekheb">ψυχή νοῦς</span>). The second of these methods of division is known as the trilogy, and is of most importance to the Christian reader. By it is understood (1) the body, wholly and entirely material, of and belonging to this world; (2) the mind or reason, corporal also—that is, arising from the body, and depending in its exquisite balance upon it; (3) the true soul or spirit, the breath as it were of God, immaterial and immortal. Our bodily nature, of course, is shared with the lower creation, and the spiritual with the higher, while the intellectual is peculiar to mankind. If it be hard to draw a line between vegetable and animal, harder still is it to separate instinct from reason, the difference being of degree rather than kind. But if the one side of the mental soul—namely, the rational, be near akin to what is termed instinctive in the brute, the other, the intellectual, however it may, as it does, soar upward, yet approaches not to the angels, for the difference here is of kind and not degree. Now, strange to say, the Apostle treats not of the spirit but the natural soul. Other texts in plenty assure us that God is able to save the one; from this we may learn salvation is for both, such being the work of “the engrafted Word.” Reason and intellect consecrated to divine service have an eternity before them, one of activity and not repose. The highest conception of God to the Greek mind was the Aristotelian idea of intellectual self-sufficiency and contemplation; the Oriental strives, as for ages it has striven, for extinction and nothingness; but to the Christian is given the sure and certain hope of the glorified body, the enlightened soul, the perfected spirit—three in one, and one in three—working the will and praise of its Maker and Redeemer for ever.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">James 1:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— Because wrath is such a hinderance to true religion, and you are regenerated; <span class="ital">lay apart </span>— As you would a dirty garment; <span class="ital">all filthiness </span>— Every kind of sin which is of a defiling nature.

And if men would govern their tongues, they must govern their passions. The worst thing we can bring to any dispute, is anger. Here is an exhortation to lay apart, and to cast off as a filthy garment, all sinful practices. This must reach to sins of thought and affection, as well as of speech and practice; to every thing corrupt and sinful. We must yield ourselves to the word of God, with humble and teachable minds. Being willing to hear of our faults, taking it not only patiently, but thankfully. It is the design of the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and those who propose any mean or low ends in attending upon it, dishonour the gospel, and disappoint their own souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - In view of the fact that God has begotten us for his own service; in view of the fact that excited feeling tends only to wrong, let us lay aside all that is evil, and submit ourselves wholly to the influence of truth.<p>Lay apart all filthiness - The word here rendered filthiness, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, It means properly filth; and then is applied to evil conduct considered as disgusting or offensive. Sin may be contemplated as a wrong thing; as a violation of law; as evil in its nature and tendency, and therefore to be avoided; or it may be contemplated as disgusting, offensive, loathsome. To a pure mind, this is one of its most odious characteristics; for, to such a mind, sin in any form is more loathsome than the most offensive object can be to any of the senses.<p>And superfluity of haughtiness - Literally, "abounding of evil." It is rendered by Doddridge, "overflowing of malignity;" by Tindal, "superfluity of maliciousness;" by Benson, "superfluity of malice;" by Bloomfield, "petulance." The phrase "superfluity of haughtiness," or of evil, does not exactly express the sense, as if we were only to lay aside that which abounded, or which is superfluous, though we might retain that which does not come under this description; but the object of the apostle is to express his deep abhorrence of the thing referred to by strong and emphatic language. He had just spoken of sin in one aspect, as filthy, loathsome, detestable; here he designs to express his abhorrence of it by a still more emphatic description, and he speaks of it not merely as an evil, but as an evil abounding, overflowing; an evil in the highest degree. The thing referred to had the essence of evil in it (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  kakia); but it was not merely evil, it was evil that was aggravated, that was overflowing, that was eminent in degree (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  perisseian). The particular reference in these passages is to the reception of the truth; and the doctrine taught is, that a corrupt mind, a mind full of sensuality and wickedness, is not favorable to the reception of the truth. It is not fitted to see its beauty, to appreciate its value, to understand its just claims, or to welcome it to the soul. Purity of heart is the best preparation always for seeing the force of truth.<p>And receive with meekness - That is, open the mind and heart to instruction, and to the fair influence of truth. Meekness, gentleness, docility, are everywhere required in receiving the instructions of religion, as they are in obtaining knowledge of any kind. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2-3</a>.<p>The engrafted word - The gospel is here represented under the image of that which is implanted or engrafted from another source; by a figure that would be readily understood, for the art of engrafting is everywhere known. Sometimes the gospel is represented under the image of seed sown (Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14</a>, following); but here it is under the figure of a shoot implanted or engrafted, that produces fruit of its own, whatever may be the original character of the tree into which it is engrafted. Compare the notes at <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>. The meaning here is, that we should allow the principles of the gospel to be thus engrafted on our nature; that however crabbed or perverse our nature may be, or however bitter and vile the fruits which it might bring forth of its own accord, it might, through the engrafted word, produce the fruits of righteousness.<p>Which is able to save your souls - It is not, therefore, a weak and powerless thing, merely designed to show its own feebleness, and to give occasion for God to work a miracle; but it has power, and is adapted to save. Compare the notes at <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. lay apart&#8212;"once for all" (so the Greek): as a filthy garment. Compare Joshua's filthy garments, Zec 3:3, 5; Re 7:14. "Filthiness" is cleansed away by hearing the word (Joh 15:3).<p>superfluity of naughtiness&#8212;excess (for instance, the intemperate spirit implied in "wrath," Jas 1:19, 20), which arises from malice (our natural, evil disposition towards one another). 1Pe 2:1 has the very same words in the Greek. So "malice" is the translation, Eph 4:31; Col 3:8. "Faulty excess" [Bengel] is not strong enough. Superfluous excess in speaking is also reprobated as "coming of evil" (the Greek is akin to the word for "naughtiness" here) in the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 5:37), with which James' Epistle is so connected.<p>with meekness&#8212;in mildness towards one another [Alford], the opposite to "wrath" (Jas 1:20): answering to "as new-born babes" (1Pe 2:2). Meekness, I think, includes also a childlike, docile, humble, as well as an uncontentious, spirit (Ps 25:9; 45:4; Isa 66:2; Mt 5:5; 11:28-30; 18:3, 4; contrast Ro 2:8). On "receive," applied to ground receiving seed, compare Mr 4:20.

The law came to man only from without, and admonished him of his duty. The Gospel is engrafted inwardly, and so fulfils the ultimate design of the law (De 6:6; 11:18; Ps 119:11). Alford translates, "The implanted word," referring to the parable of the sower (Mt 13:1-23).

The word <span class="greekheb">περισσεία</span>, united to <span class="greekheb">ῥυπαρίαν</span> by the copulative <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (not as Schneckenburger thinks exegetical; in the cited passages, <a href="/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>, the position of <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is entirely different), foreign to classical Greek, has in the N. T. the signification <span class="ital">abundance</span>, properly: “abundance flowing over the measure,” which Lange incorrectly renders “outflow, communication of life;” see <a href="/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,">2 Corinthians 10:15</a>. Nevertheless the word has been here taken in a meaning corresponding to <span class="greekheb">ῥυπαρία</span>, and has been explained as = <span class="greekheb">περίσσωμα</span> excrementum (Beza, Piscator, Erasmus, Schmid, and others), or also <span class="ital">growth</span> (Lösner, Pott, Hottinger, Kern, Schneckenburger, de Wette). But both meanings are arbitrary. The defenders of the second explanation indeed appeal to the passage in Philo, <span class="ital">de vict. off.</span> p. 854 B: <span class="greekheb">περιτέμνεσθε</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὰς περιττὰς φύσεις</span> (fortasse <span class="greekheb">ἐμφύσεις</span>, de Wette) <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ</span>; but from this passage it does not follow that <span class="greekheb">περισσεία</span> can be explained de ramis in vite vel arbore abundantibus falceque resecandis (Lösner). It is equally unjustifiable when Küttner, Michaelis, Augusti, Gebser, Bouman, and others explain <span class="greekheb">περισσεία κακίας</span> as “<span class="greekheb">κακία</span> surviving from earlier times,” and thus take <span class="greekheb">περισσεία</span> as synonymous with <span class="greekheb">περίσσευμα</span> (<a href="/mark/8-8.htm" title="So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.">Mark 8:8</a>). Against all these arbitrary views Theile, Wiesinger, Brückner correctly retain the word in the same sense which it has elsewhere in the N. T., so that <span class="greekheb">περισσεία κακίας</span> is <span class="ital">the abundance of</span> <span class="greekheb">κακία</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the abundantly existing <span class="greekheb">κακία</span>; only <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> is hardly to be supplied as if James had only his readers specially in view (Theile: quod lectoribus peculiare erat).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Κακία</span> is not here synonymous with <span class="greekheb">πονηρία</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>) = vitiositas (Semler, Theile, and others), but, according to the context, in contrast with <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι</span>, as in <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>, <a href="/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a>, a more special idea, namely, the hostile disposition toward our neighbour which we call <span class="ital">malignity</span> (Cremer: malevolence, as social faultiness). Wiesinger inaccurately takes it as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>, as <span class="ital">that</span> is only one of the proofs of <span class="greekheb">κακία</span>; incorrectly Rosenmüller = morositas.[94] On <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέμενοι</span>, comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>.[95] The participle precedes as a subordinate thought to <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span>, because in consequence of man’s sinful nature room can only be made for the good by the rejection of the bad. Also, where similar sentences are co-ordinate, the exhortation to <span class="greekheb">ἀποτίθεσθαι</span> precedes; comp. <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>, <a href="/context/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;...">Ephesians 4:22-23</a>, and also the exhortation of Christ: <span class="greekheb">μετανοεῖτα καὶ πιστεύετε</span>, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm" title="And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.">Mark 1:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the positive exhortation: <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι</span> emphatically precedes, in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">κακία</span> from which flows <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>. <span class="greekheb">πραΰτης</span> (= <span class="greekheb">πραότης</span>) denotes a loving, gentle disposition <span class="ital">toward our neighbour;</span> comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm" title="In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;">2 Timothy 2:25</a>, <a href="/titus/3-2.htm" title="To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.">Titus 3:2</a>, and other passages; the opposite is <span class="greekheb">ὀριλότης</span> (Pape’s <span class="ital">Gr. Wörterb.</span>); incorrectly Calvin: hoc verbo significat modestiam et facilitatem mentis ad discendum compositae. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι</span> does not therefore mean docili animo (Grotius, Rosenmüller, Hottinger), nor “with a modest disposition, which recognises the good deeds of Christianity” (Gebser). Also <span class="greekheb">ἐν πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span> is not a pregnant construction, as if the sense were: monet … illo <span class="greekheb">λόγῳ</span> duce <span class="greekheb">πραΰτητα</span> exerceant (Schneckenburger); but James exhorts to the reception of the word <span class="greekheb">ἐν πραΰτητι</span>, in contrast to those who hear the word in order to use it as a weapon of hatred (condemning others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Δέξασθε</span> (opp. to <span class="greekheb">λαλῆσαι</span>, <a href="/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>) corresponds to <span class="greekheb">ἀκοῦσαι</span>, but expresses more than that, namely: “the inner reception, the taking hold of it with the heart;” comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>. The object belonging to it: <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον ἔμφυτον</span>, can only be the same as what was called the <span class="greekheb">λόγος ἀληθείας</span> in <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a> (Wiesinger); it is neither “the reason <span class="ital">innate</span> in man “(Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">τὸν διακριτικὸν τοῦ βελτίονος καὶ τοῦ χείρονος</span>· <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὃ καὶ λογικοὶ ἐσμὲν καὶ λεγόμεθα</span>; see <span class="ital">Constit. Apost.</span> viii. 12: <span class="greekheb">νόμον δέδωκας ἔμφυτον</span>), nor the so-called <span class="ital">inner light</span> of the mystics, nor the gospel “in its subjective form of life” (Lange). The verb <span class="greekheb">δέχεσθαι</span> is opposed to these explanations. James designates the gospel a <span class="greekheb">λόγον ἔμφυτον</span>, inasmuch as it was no longer strange to the hearts of his readers as Christians; also because it was not merely transmitted (Hottinger: <span class="greekheb">ἔμφυτος</span> = traditus), but <span class="ital">implanted.</span>[96] The verb <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span> does not conflict with this, as the word by which the new birth is effected among Christians is to them ever proclaimed anew, and must by them be ever received anew, in order that the new life may be preserved and increased in them. It is therefore not necessary, against the use of language, to change the idea: verbum quod implantatum or insertum est, into: verbum quod implantatur or inseritur, or to assume here a prolepsis, as is undoubtedly the case in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a> (see Meyer <span class="ital">in loco</span>), and <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a> (Lünemann <span class="ital">in loco</span>), and with Calvin to explain it: ita suscipite ut vere inseratur (similarly Semler, de Wette,[97] and others). The mode in which the adjective is united with the substantive is opposed to a prolepsis, which would be only imaginable were it said: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΛΌΓΟΝ ἜΜΦΥΤΟΝ ΤΑῖς ΚΑΡΔΊΑΙς ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, or something similar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the strengthening of the exhortation expressed, James annexes to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἜΜΦΥΤΟΝ ΛΌΓΟΝ</span></span></span> the clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΔΥΝΆΜΕΝΟΝ ΣῶΣΑΙ ΤᾺς ΨΥΧᾺς ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, by which, on the one hand, the value of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς</span></span></span> is prominently brought forward, and, on the other hand, is indicated what result ought to arise from the hearing of the word. By the verb <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΥΝΆΜΕΝΟΝ</span></span></span> not the freedom of the human will (Serrarius: quod <span class="ital">potest</span> salvare, ut arbitrii libertas indicetur), but the <span class="ital">power</span> of the word is emphasized; it is, as Paul says, <span class="greekheb">δύναμις Θεοῦ εἰς σωτηρίαν πάντι τῷ πιστεύσντι</span> (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>). But if it has this power, man must receive it, and that in a right manner, so that it may prove its efficacy in him and save his soul. It is to be observed that James says this of his readers, whom he had previously designated as born again (<a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a>). Thus, according to James, Christians by the new birth do not as yet possess <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΩΤΗΡΊΑ</span></span></span> (the future salvation), but its obtainment is conditioned by their conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺς ΨΥΧᾺς ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, James might simply have written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>, but Schneckenburger correctly warns: cave pro mera sumas circumscriptione personalis; <span class="ital">animi</span> enim proprie res agitur; see chap. <a href="/james/5-20.htm" title="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">Jam 5:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[94] Meyer’s translation: <span class="ital">malice</span> (<a href="/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>), <span class="ital">malicious disposition</span> (<a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>), would also not be entirely suitable, but too special. How Luther has understood the idea cannot be determined from his translation <span class="ital">wickedness</span> (Boshcit); since he thus constantly renders <span class="greekheb">κακία</span>, it may be taken in a general or in a special sense; the word badness (Schlechtigkeit) does not occur with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[95] To the assertion of Lange, that <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέμενοι</span> is not to be rendered <span class="ital">putting</span> off, because the reference is not figuratively to the putting off of filthy garments, but <span class="ital">removing;</span> the passages <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἀποθώμεθα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσώμεθα</span>) and <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls....">Jam 1:21-25</a> form a self-contained section.

The English “naughtiness,” though used in the 16th century, as by Latimer and Shakespeare, as equivalent to “sin” or “wickedness,” has gradually lost its sharpness, and has come to be applied almost exclusively to the faults of children. The Greek word, though, like the Latin word from which <span class="ital">malice</span> comes, originally generic in its meaning, had come to be associated mainly (as in <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a>) with the sins that have their root in wrath and anger, rather than with those that originate in love of pleasure, and so carries on the sequence of thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">receive with meekness the engrafted word</span>] The order of the words in the original is more emphatic, <span class="bld">but in meekness</span> (as contrasted with wrath and malice) <span class="bld">receive ye</span>. The “engrafted word” is that which was before referred to as the instrument by which the new and better life was engendered. The English “engrafted” suggests one process of growth somewhat too definitely, and <span class="bld">implanted</span> would be a better rendering. The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament (the Greek word in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a> is more specific), but, like so many of St James’s phrases, appears in the sapiential books of the Apocrypha (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/12-10.htm" title="But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.">Wis 12:10</a>, “their malice was <span class="ital">bred</span> in them”). We note the agreement of his teaching with that of the Parable of the Sower, where the Seed is the “Word,” and the conditions of its fertility are found in “the honest and good heart” (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm" title="But he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it; which also bears fruit, and brings forth, some an hundred times, some sixty, some thirty.">Matthew 13:23</a>), free from prejudice and bitterness. Moral discipline, the putting away of that which defiles, is the right preparation for the highest spiritual life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which is able to save your souls</span>] The words express at once the power, and the limits of the power. There was in the implanted word, taken in its widest sense, the promise and the potency of salvation, yet it did not work as by compulsion or by a charm, but required the co-operation of man’s will. So, later on, St James speaks of God Himself as being “able to save” (chap. <a href="/james/4-12.htm" title="There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you that judge another?">James 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποθέμενοι πᾶσαν ῥυπαρίαν</span>, <span class="ital">laying aside all filthiness</span>) A metaphor from a garment; ch. <a href="/james/2-2.htm" title="For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;">Jam 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ῥυπαρία</span>, <span class="ital">defilement</span>, which is cleansed away <span class="ital">by hearing</span> the word: <a href="/john/15-3.htm" title="Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.">John 15:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τερισσείαν κακίας</span>) <span class="ital">abundance, excess, which is usually faulty</span>, especially <span class="ital">in speaking</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a>).

Here only in the New Testament, never in LXX.; but the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the word used of the "filthy garments" in <a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3, 4</a> - a narrative which illustrates the passage before us. <span class="accented">Karts</span> is not vice in general, but rather that vicious nature which is bent on doing harm to others (see Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>). Thus the two words <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> comprise two classes of sins - the sensual and the malignant, <span class="cmt_word">Engrafted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">implanted.</span> The word is only found again in Wisd. 12:10, where it signifies "inborn." St. James's teaching here is almost like a reminiscence of the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>, etc.). The "implanted Word" is the gospel teaching. "The seed is the Word of God" (<a href="/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Filthiness (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament, but James uses the kindred adjective (<a href="/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>), "vile raiment." &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, filth, occurs in <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> - on which see notes; and the verb &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;, to be filthy, is found in <a href="/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>.<p>Superfluity of naughtiness (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>A translation which may be commended to the attention of indiscriminate panegyrists of the A. V. &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is an unclassical word, and occurs in three other New-Testament passages - <a href="/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-15.htm">2 Corinthians 10:15</a>. In all these it is rendered abundance, both by A. V. and Rev. There seems to be no need of departing from this meaning here, as Rev., overjoying. The sense is abounding or abundant wickedness. For haughtiness Rev. gives wickedness, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>, where it changes malice to wickedness. It is mostly rendered malice in both A. V. and Rev. In this passage, as in the two from Peter, Rev. gives malice, in margin. Malice is an adequate translation, the word denoting a malevolent disposition toward one's neighbor. Hence it is not a general term for moral evil, but a special form of vice. Compare the wrath of man, <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>. Naughtiness has acquired a petty sense in popular usage, as of the mischievous pranks of children, which renders it out of the question here.<p>With meekness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., "in meekness;" opposed to malice.<p>Engrafted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament. Better, and more literally, as Rev., implanted. It marks a characteristic of the word of truth (<a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>). It is implanted; divinely given, in contrast with something acquired by study. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>, "the word of the kingdom - sown in his heart." Grafted or graffed is expressed by a peculiar word, employed by Paul only, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, from &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a sharp point, thus emphasizing the fact of the incision required in grafting.
