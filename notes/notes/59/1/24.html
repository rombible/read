There is a recognition of the well-known face, followed by instant and complete forgetfulness; and thus is it often with the mirror of the soul. In some striking sermon or book a man’s self is made manifest to him, and the picture may be too familiar to cause aversion; but, whether or no, the impression fades from his mind as quickly as the echoes of the preacher’s words. At the best the knowledge was only superficial, perhaps momentary; widely different from that which comes of a holy walk with God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:22-25 If we heard a sermon every day of the week, and an angel from heaven were the preacher, yet, if we rested in hearing only, it would never bring us to heaven. Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it is our own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let the word of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us the corruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and it will tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the law discovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain do we hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy, instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hear the word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it for counsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spiritual life. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be, blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would be connected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divine revelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation, and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spirit of adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark the distinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but in his deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven. Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by his grace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he beholdeth himself - While he looks in the mirror he sees his true appearance.<p>And goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth - As soon as he goes away, he forgets it.

"Contemplate" answers to hearing the word: "goeth his way," to relaxing the attention after hearing&#8212;letting the mind go elsewhere, and the interest of the thing heard pass away: then forgetfulness follows [Alford] (Compare Eze 33:31). "Contemplate" here, and in Jas 1:23, implies that, though cursory, yet some knowledge of one's self, at least for the time, is imparted in hearing the word (1Co 14:24).<p>and &#8230; and&#8212;The repetition expresses hastiness joined with levity [Bengel].<p>forgetteth what manner of man he was&#8212;in the mirror.

So he that sees the blemishes of his soul in the glass of the word, and doth not remember them to do them away, looks in that glass (i.e. hears the word) in vain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way,.... He takes a slight glance of himself, and departs: <p>and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was; he forgets either his spots, blemishes, and imperfections; or his comeliness and beauty; the features of his face, be they comely or not: so a bare hearer of the word, who is not concerned to practise what he hears, while he is hearing, he observes some things amiss in himself, and some excellencies in Christ; but, when the discourse is over, he goes his way, and thinks no more of either. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/1-24.htm" title="For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man he was.">Jam 1:24</a>. With this verse begins the explanation of the image given in <a href="/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">Jam 1:25</a> (therefore <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>), whilst <span class="greekheb">κατανοεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is again resumed by <span class="greekheb">κατενόησεν ἑαυτόν</span>. By <span class="greekheb">ἀπελήλυθεν</span> the point of the mere transitoriness of the contemplation in the glass only before presupposed is brought forward, and by <span class="greekheb">ἐπελάθετο</span> the result of such a contemplation is added, by which the points of application, which James employs, are brought out. The emphasis lies on <span class="greekheb">ἀπελήλυθεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως ἐπελάθετο</span>. The form of representation is here the same as in <a href="/james/1-11.htm" title="For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.">Jam 1:11</a>. It is not a particular instance which may occur (Wiesinger), but a general statement which is here introduced in the form of a single incident, as the contemplating oneself in the glass is always only a temporary and not a permanent state. The hearing of the word answers to <span class="greekheb">κατανοσεῖν</span>; the averting of the mind from what is heard to <span class="greekheb">ἀπέρχεσθαι</span>; and the being unconcerned about what is heard, by which the realization of the word in the life is prevented, to <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως ἐπιλανθάνεσθαι</span>. James can only think on man according to his ethical condition in relation to the demands of the divine will, as corresponding to <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτόν</span> in the application. It is true that he does not definitely state this; but from this it does not follow that James, overlooking all other considerations, has had only in view generally the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the word, because the comparison of the word with a glass, which gives to him who looks in it to see <span class="ital">his own image</span>, would be without meaning.[101] On the use of the perfect (<span class="greekheb">ἀπελήλυθεν</span>) between the aorists, see Winer, p. 243 f. [E. T. 340].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖος ἦν</span>, Wiesinger correctly remarks, “namely in the glass.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[101] According to most interpreters, “the depravity of the natural man” is chiefly to be thought on; but this is not entirely suitable, as James addresses Christians who as such are no longer natural men. In a wholly arbitrary manner is the reference inserted by some in <span class="greekheb">κατενόησεν</span>, to spots which disfigure the face.
