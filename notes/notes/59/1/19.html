By reason of the Divine benevolence, the Apostle urges his readers—(1) to meekness, (2) self-knowledge, (3) practical religion.<p><span class= "bld">Wherefore, my beloved brethen.</span>—There appears to be some small error in the MSS. here, but the alteration is only just worth mentioning: <span class= "ital">ye know my brethren beloved, </span>seems the correct version, the very abruptness of which may serve to arrest attention. Yea, “have ye not known?” might well be asked further in the indignant language of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/40-21.htm" title="Have you not known? have you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?">Isaiah 40:21</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</span>—For all these cautions are required in the building up of the new life. “The quick speaker is the quick kindler;” and we are told later on “how great a matter a little fire kindleth<span class= "ital">”</span> (<a href="/james/3-5.htm" title="Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!">James 3:5</a>). And what have we at all to do with wrath, much less that our whole life—as unhappily it often is—should be wasted with such bitterness? Anger, no doubt, is a wholesome tonic for some minds, and certain weaknesses; but “he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city” (<a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm" title="He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city.">Proverbs 16:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:...">James 1:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— As if he had said, Since you are regenerated, and that by the word of God, therefore <span class="ital">let every man be swift to hear </span>— That word; let him be willing and desirous to receive instruction from it, and therefore diligent in embracing all opportunities of hearing it; <span class="ital">slow to speak </span>— To deliver his opinion in matters of faith, that he does not yet well understand. Persons half instructed frequently have a high opinion of their own knowledge in religious matters, are very fond of teaching others, and zealous to bring them over to their opinions. That the converted Jews were fond of being teachers, we learn from <a href="/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">James 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.">1 Timothy 1:7</a>. <span class="ital">Slow to wrath </span>— Against those that differ from him. Intemperate religious zeal is often accompanied by a train of bad passions, and particularly with anger against those who differ from us in opinion. The Jews, even the Jewish Christians to whom this letter was chiefly written, were very faulty in this respect. The apostle, however, may be understood as cautioning his readers against easily yielding to provocation in any respect whatever, and especially when injuriously treated by their persecutors. <span class="ital">For the wrath of man </span>— Even when it appears in the garb of religious zeal, <span class="ital">worketh not </span>— But, on the contrary, greatly obstructs, <span class="ital">the righteousness of God </span>— Instead of promoting the cause of true religion in the world, it is a reproach to it, and a means of exciting the prejudices of mankind against it. Persecution, in particular, the effect of the wrath of man, if violent, may make men hypocrites, by forcing them to profess what they do not believe; but it has no influence to produce that genuine faith which God accounts to men for righteousness. Nothing but rational arguments, with the illumination of the Spirit of God, can do this.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:19-21 Instead of blaming God under our trials, let us open our ears and hearts to learn what he teaches by them. And if men would govern their tongues, they must govern their passions. The worst thing we can bring to any dispute, is anger. Here is an exhortation to lay apart, and to cast off as a filthy garment, all sinful practices. This must reach to sins of thought and affection, as well as of speech and practice; to every thing corrupt and sinful. We must yield ourselves to the word of God, with humble and teachable minds. Being willing to hear of our faults, taking it not only patiently, but thankfully. It is the design of the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and those who propose any mean or low ends in attending upon it, dishonour the gospel, and disappoint their own souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore, my beloved brethren - The connection is this: "since God is the only source of good; since he tempts no man; and since by his mere sovereign goodness, without any claim on our part, we have had the high honor conferred on us of being made the first-fruits of his creatures, we ought to be ready to hear his voice, to subdue all our evil passions, and to bring our souls to entire practical obedience." The necessity of obedience, or the doctrine that the gospel is not only to be learned but practiced, is pursued at length in this and the following chapter. The particular statement here <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-21</a> is, that religion requires us to be meek and docile; to lay aside all irritability against the truth, and all pride of opinion, and all corruption of heart, and to receive meekly the ingrafted word. See the analysis of the chapter.<p>Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak - That is, primarily, to hear God; to listen to the instructions of that truth by which we have been begotten, and brought into so near relation to him. At the same time, though this is the primary sense of the phrase here, it may be regarded as inculcating the general doctrine that we are to be more ready to hear than to speak; or that we are to be disposed to learn always, and from any source. Our appropriate condition is rather that of learners than instructors; and the attitude of mind which we should cultivate is that of a readiness to receive information from any quarter. The ancients have some sayings on this subject which are well worthy of our attention. "Men have two ears, and but one tongue, that they should hear more than they speak." "The ears are always open, ever ready to receive instruction; but the tongue is surrounded with a double row of teeth, to hedge it in, and to keep it within proper bounds." See Benson. So Valerius Maximus, vii. 2.<p>"How noble was the response of Xenocrates! When he met the reproaches of others with a profound silence, someone asked him why he alone was silent. 'Because,' says he, 'I have sometimes had occasion to regret that I have spoken, never that I was silent.'" See Wetstein. So the son of Sirach, "Be swift to hear, and with deep consideration (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  en makrothumia) give answer." So the Rabbis have some similar sentiments. "Talk little and work much." Pirkey Aboth. c. i. 15. "The righteous speak little and do much; the wicked speak much and do nothing." Bava Metsia, fol. 87. A sentiment similar to that before us is found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>. "Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God." So <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>. "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin." <a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>. "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life." <a href="/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>. "The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright, but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness."<p>Slow to wrath - That is, we are to govern and restrain our temper; we are not to give indulgence to excited and angry passions. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>, "He that is slow to anger is greater than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." See also on this subject, <a href="/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-18.htm">Proverbs 15:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-19.htm">Proverbs 19:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-24.htm">Proverbs 22:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>; <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>. The particular point here is, however, not that we should be slow to wrath as a general habit of mind, which is indeed most true, but in reference particularly to the reception of the truth. We should lay aside all anger and wrath, and should come to the investigation of truth with a calm mind, and an imperturbed spirit. A state of wrath or anger is always unfavorable to the investigation of truth. Such an investigation demands a calm spirit, and he whose mind is excited and enraged is not in a condition to see the value of truth, or to weigh the evidence for it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Wherefore&#8212;as your evil is of yourselves, but your good from God. However, the oldest manuscripts and versions read thus: "Ye know it (so Eph 5:5; Heb 12:17), my beloved brethren; BUT (consequently) let every man be swift to hear," that is, docile in receiving "the word of truth" (Jas 1:18, 21). The true method of hearing is treated in Jas 1:21-27, and Jas 2:1-26.<p>slow to speak&#8212;(Pr 10:19; 17:27, 28; Ec 5:2). A good way of escaping one kind of temptation arising from ourselves (Jas 1:13). Slow to speak authoritatively as a master or teacher of others (compare Jas 3:1): a common Jewish fault: slow also to speak such hasty things of God, as in Jas 1:13. Two ears are given to us, the rabbis observe, but only one tongue: the ears are open and exposed, whereas the tongue is walled in behind the teeth.<p>slow to wrath&#8212;(Jas 3:13, 14; 4:5). Slow in becoming heated by debate: another Jewish fault (Ro 2:8), to which much speaking tends. Tittmann thinks not so much "wrath" is meant, as an indignant feeling of fretfulness under the calamities to which the whole of human life is exposed; this accords with the "divers temptations" in Jas 1:2. Hastiness of temper hinders hearing God's word; so Naaman, 2Ki 5:11; Lu 4:28.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let every man be swift to hear; </span> prompt and ready to hear God speaking in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the word of truth, </span> before mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Slow to speak; </span> either silently and submissively hear the word, or speak not rashly and precipitately of the things of faith, but be well furnished yourselves with spiritual knowledge, ere you take upon you to teach others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Slow to wrath; </span> either, be not angry at the word, or the dispensers of it, though it come close to your consciences, and discover your secret sins; the word is salt, do not quarrel if it make your sores smart, being it will keep them from festering: or, be not angrily prejudiced against those that dissent from you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the wrath of man:</span> that anger which is merely human, and generally sinful, inordinate passion and carnal zeal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Worketh not the righteousness of God; </span> will not accomplish the ends of the word in you, viz. to work that righteousness which in the word God prescribes you. But here is withal a meiosis in the words, less being spoken than is intended; it is implied therefore, that the wrath of man hinders the operation of the word, and disposeth to that unrighteousness which is forbidden by it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore, my beloved brethren,.... Since the Gospel, the word of truth, is the means and instrument which God makes use of in regeneration, and in forming people for himself: <p>let every man be swift to hear; not anything; not idle and unprofitable talk, or filthy and corrupt communication; but wholesome advice, good instructions, and the gracious experiences of the saints, and, above all, the word of God; to the hearing of which men should fly, as doves to their windows; should make haste, and be early in their attendance on it, as well, as constant; and receive it with all readiness, and with a sort of greediness of mind, that their souls may be profited, and God may be glorified: the phrase is Jewish; things easy and smooth, a man is , "swift to hear them (l): slow to speak"; against what is heard, without thoroughly weighing and considering what is said; and this may regard silence under hearing the word, and is also a rule to be observed in private conversation: or the sense may be, be content to be hearers of the word, and not forward to be preachers of it; and if called to that work, think before you speak, meditate on the word, and study to be approved to God and men. Silence is not only highly commended by the Pythagoreans, among whom it was enjoined their disciples five years (m); but also by the Jews: they say, nothing is better for the body than silence; that if a word is worth one shekel, silence is worth two, or worth a precious stone; that it is the spice of speech, and the chief of all spices; that it is the hedge of wisdom; hence it is the advice of Shammai; "say little, and do much" (n): and they cry up, as a very excellent precept, "be silent, and hear"; and as containing more than persons are aware of (o): <p>slow to wrath; in hearing; when admonitions and reproofs are given, sin is exposed, and vice corrected, and the distinguishing doctrines of grace, are preached; which are apt to fill natural men with wrath, and which must greatly hinder the usefulness of the word; see <a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28</a>.

To <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a> is annexed at first the exhortation to <span class="ital">hear</span>, and then in <a href="/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">Jam 1:22</a> the more extended exhortation, not only to be hearers, but also doers of the word. By the reading <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span>, the connection with the preceding is evidently expressed, <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> being with the following imperative, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm" title="Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a> = <span class="ital">itaque, therefore.</span> This reading is, however, suspicious, as not only predominant authorities declare for the reading <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span>, but also <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> might be easily changed into <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span>, in order to mark the thoughts in this verse as an inference from <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a>. It is true the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span>, conjoined with this reading (in B and C), appears to be harsh; but it may be explained from this, that the sentence <span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span> … <span class="greekheb">ταχὺς εἰς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is introduced as being almost a proverbial expression. The reading of A: <span class="greekheb">ἔστε δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔστω</span>, appears to be a correction, in order to unite this verse more closely with the preceding. <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> may be either indicative (comp. <a href="/hebrews/12-17.htm" title="For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.">Hebrews 12:17</a>; usually <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>) or imperative; it is at all events to be referred, not to what goes before,[87] but to what follows, as otherwise <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, or something similar, by which it would be referred back to <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a>, would require to be added. Semler explains it as an indicative, paraphrasing it: non ignoratis istud carmen; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-11.htm" title="Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer.">Sir 5:11</a> : <span class="greekheb">γίνου ταχὺς ἐν ἀκροάσει σου κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. As, however, the sentence in question is here expressed in different words, so it is not to be assumed that James would here refer to that passage in Ecclesiasticus. It is thus better to consider <span class="greekheb">ἴστε</span> as an imperative, as it then corresponds to <span class="greekheb">μὴ πλανᾶσθε</span> (<a href="/james/1-16.htm" title="Do not err, my beloved brothers.">Jam 1:16</a>), and serves strongly to impress the following sentence on the readers, in favour of which also is the address <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί</span>, added here as well as there; see also chap. <a href="/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">Jam 2:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sentence is entirely general: <span class="ital">let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</span> Whilst Laurentius and others consider this as a <span class="ital">sententia generalis</span>, which stands in no internal connection with the preceding, but is pressed upon the readers in its entire generality, most interpreters supply to <span class="greekheb">ἀκοῦσαι</span> directly taken from the preceding <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον ἀληθείας</span>; thus Estius, Gataker, Gomar, Piscator, Hornejus, Baumgarten, Rosenmüller, Pott, Hottinger, Gebser, de Wette, Wiesinger, and others; but this is arbitrary, particularly as <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ἄνθρωπος</span> points to the universality of the sentence. However, the intention of James is not to inculcate it on his readers in its general sense, but he wishes rather that they, as Christians, should apply it to their Christian conduct; so that for them <span class="greekheb">ἁκοῦσαι</span> certainly refers to <span class="greekheb">λόγος τῆς ἀληθείας</span> (Heisen, Schneckenburger,[88] Theile). <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> is therefore not to be supplied to <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ἄνθρωπος</span>, still we may say with Semler: pertinet ad Christianos, quatenus sunt Christiani; but the expression is, as part of the general sentence, likewise to be retained in its general meaning; but what holds good of all men, in a peculiar manner holds good of Christians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ideas <span class="greekheb">ταχύς</span> and <span class="greekheb">βραδύς</span>, in the N. T. only here (in <a href="/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">βραδύς</span> has a different meaning), form a direct contrast; as in Philo, <span class="ital">de conf. ling.</span> p. 327 B: <span class="greekheb">βραδὺς ὠφελῆσαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ταχὺς βλάψαι</span> (see <span class="ital">Dio O.</span> 32). By <span class="greekheb">βραδὺς εἰς ὀργήν</span> added to the second clause, James announces what kind of speaking he means, namely, speaking <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ὀργῆς</span>.[89] But from <a href="/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a> it is evident that by <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>—which, as Cremer correctly remarks, denotes not the passive affection, but active displeasure directed toward any one—is to be understood sinful and passionate zeal. <span class="greekheb">βραδύς</span> is to be taken in both clauses in the same sense, which—as is often the case with expressions in figurative language—goes beyond the literal and direct idea of the word, as Hornejus correctly explains it in reference to the <span class="ital">second</span> clause: ita jubet tardos ad iram esse, ut ab eo nos prorsus retrahat. Several expositors refer both clauses, others at least the second chiefly or alone, to the conduct toward God, with or without an express reference to <a href="/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">Jam 1:13</a>.[90] But this is incorrect; the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span> to which James alludes is rather carnal zeal, which will censure its neighbour, whose fruit is not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΡΉΝΗ</span></span></span>, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΑΤΑΣΤΑΣΊΑ</span></span></span> (chap. <a href="/james/3-16.htm" title="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.">Jam 3:16</a>). The warning is addressed to those Christians who misuse the gospel (the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span>) as the Pharisees did the law, not for their own sanctification, but for the gratification of their censoriousness and quarrelsome temper; see chap. 3. Although James with this exhortation has specially in view the conduct of Christians in their assemblies, yet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΑΛῆΣΑΙ</span></span></span> must not be restricted to the idea of mere <span class="ital">teaching</span> (Bede, Hornejus, Hottinger, de Wette, Brückner, and others). <span class="greekheb">λαλῆσαι</span> is a more comprehensive term than <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΆΣΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, which is included in it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[87] De Wette explains it: “Ye know this, namely, that He has regenerated us;” but this, as he himself confesses, gives a wholly unsatisfactory sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] Schneckenburger: quamvis de sensu dubitari nequeat, nempe de addiscendo <span class="greekheb">λόγῳ ἀληθείας</span> caveas tamen vocem hanc <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> putes grammatice subaudiendam; sed Jacobus regulam istam generalem … ita hic subnectit, ut eam ad rem christianam imprimis valere moneat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[89] The circumstance is in favour of this close connection of these two last clauses, that if <span class="greekheb">λαλῆσαι</span> is here taken in a wider sense (as Gunkel thinks), then a different signification must be given to <span class="greekheb">βραδύς</span> in the two clauses, as <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> here, as the following verse shows, must be taken in a bad sense. Lange thinks that James does not absolutely reject <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>; but whilst he understands by <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> eagerness of passion to which one is led from eagerness in speaking by warmth, he evidently understands this as something to be entirely rejected. According to Bouman, the anger here is meant to which one is inflamed by the <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν</span> of <span class="ital">another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[90] </span>On <span class="greekheb">βραδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ λαλ</span>. Bengel remarks: ut nil loquatur contra Deum, nec sinistre de Deo; and on <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>: ira sive impatientia erga Deum, iracundia erga proximum. Gebser explains <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> = anger, displeasure at God on account of the persecutions. Calvin also has this reference in view when he says: certe nemo unquam bonus erit Dei discipulus nisi qui silendo eum audiat; … non enim Deus nisi sedato animo audiri potest, as is evident from the note: (Jacobus) vult proterviam nostram corripere, ne … intempestive obstrepamus Deo.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:...">Jam 1:19-20</a>.

We find it in St Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm" title="Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>), in St Peter (<a href="/context/2_peter/3-14.htm" title="Why, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless....">2 Peter 3:14-15</a>), in St John (<a href="/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>). In the last two instances, however, the word “brethren” is wanting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let every man be swift to hear</span>] From the general thought of the high ideal of life implied in the new birth from God, St James passes to the special aspect of that ideal which was most in contrast with the besetting sin of his countrymen. To him speech was of silver, and silence of gold. In this as in many other passages of his Epistle, he echoed the teaching of the sapiential books of the Old Testament (<a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm" title="He that keeps his mouth keeps his life: but he that opens wide his lips shall have destruction.">Proverbs 13:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-29.htm" title="He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalts folly.">Proverbs 14:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-27.htm" title="He that has knowledge spares his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.">Proverbs 17:27</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm" title="Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and you on earth: therefore let your words be few.">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>) yet more, perhaps, of those of the Apocrypha. So we find “Be swift to hear” in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-11.htm" title="Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer.">Sir 5:11</a>, and maxims of a like nature in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/20-7.htm" title="A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time.">Sir 20:7</a>. The “slow to wrath” follows on “slow to speak” as pointing to the crucial test of character. If it were hard at all times to be “slow to speak,” it was harder than ever when men were roused to anger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε</span>, <span class="ital">wherefore</span>) The Summing up[15] or Conclusion, and also a Statement of those things which follow, in three divisions.

"<span class="accented">Ye</span> know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man," etc. The verse gives us St. James's version of the proverb, "Speech is silver. Silence is golden." Similar maxims were not infrequent among the Jews. So in Ecclus. 5:11, "<span class="accented">Be</span> swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer;" cf. 4:29, "Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss." In the rabbinical work, 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1. 12, we have the following saying of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (who must, therefore, have been a contemporary of St. James): "All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found ought good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork; and whoso multiplies words occasions sin." This passage is curiously like the one before us, both in the thoughts and in the expressions used. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherefore<p>The A.
