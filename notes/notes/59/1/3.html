James the Wise had learned it long and painfully, and he returns to his exhortation of it again, especially in <a href="/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7-11</a> (which see).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience - Patience is one of the fruits of such a trial, and the grace of patience is worth the trial which it may cost to procure it. This is one of the passages which show that James was acquainted with the writings of Paul. See the Introduction, Section 5. The sentiment expressed here is found in <a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>. See the notes at that verse. Paul has carried the sentiment out farther, and shows that tribulation produces other effects than patience. James only asks that patience may have its perfect work, supposing that every Christian grace is implied in this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the trying&#8212;the testing or proving of your faith, namely, by "divers temptations."

And so both are true, that tribulation, as Paul speaks, and trial, as James, work patience; and patience, not a further trial, but rather discovery, or experiment, or approbation of what we are, which appears by nothing more than by patience under sufferings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Knowing this,....

The same phrase meets us, in conjunction also with “divers temptations,” in <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>. Each was, perhaps, quoting what had become an axiom of the Church’s life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">worketh patience</span>] The Greek word always implies more than mere passive submission, the “<span class="bld"><span class="ital">endurance</span></span> unto the end” of <a href="/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-13.htm" title="But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.">Matthew 24:13</a>, the perseverance which does not falter under suffering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">Jam 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν</span>) <span class="ital">your proving</span>, or <span class="ital">trial</span>.

Were I not withheld by the parallelism in Peter,[3] I should more readily embrace in James the reading <span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως</span>, <span class="ital">of your faith</span>, supported as it is by so many witnesses.[4] As it is, <span class="ital">trial</span>, spoken of in general terms, embraces the trial of faith, love, and hope. And though there is no special mention of <span class="ital">faith</span> in this verse, yet James, as well as other apostles, esteems <span class="ital">faith</span> as all in all. See <a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a>; <a href="/james/5-15.htm" title="And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.">Jam 5:15</a>. And <span class="ital">the trial of faith</span>, in particular, is firmly established, on the authority of Peter.—<span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεται ὑπομονὴν</span>, <span class="ital">worketh patience</span>) The same expression is used, <a href="/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;">Romans 5:3</a>, with the addition, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ δοκιμὴν</span>, <span class="ital">and patience</span> (<span class="ital">worketh</span>) <span class="ital">experience</span>.
