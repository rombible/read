Emotion and sentiment may have their place in the beginning of a Christian career, but the end thereof is not yet. Until the soul be quite unmoved by any attack of Satan, the work cannot be deemed “perfect.” The doctrine is not mere quietism, much less one of apathy, but rather this, that the conscious strength of patient trust in God is able to say at all times (comp. <a href="/psalms/63-8.htm" title="My soul follows hard after you: your right hand upholds me.">Psalm 63:8</a>)—<p>“My soul hath followed hard on Thee;<p>Thy right hand hath upholden me.”<p>And if in this patience we can learn to possess our souls (<a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>) the perfect work of God will be wrought within us.<p><span class= "bld">That ye may be perfect and entire</span> (or, <span class= "ital">complete</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>—A special proof herein for religious people may be taken with regard to temper. Few trials are harder; and sweetness of disposition often melts away from physical causes, such as ill-health or fatigue. But the great test remains; and it is one which the world will ever apply with scorn to the nominally Christian, refusing to admit the claims of saintliness on the part of any whose religion is not of the household as well as the Church. The entirety and completeness of the life hidden with Christ in God (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>) are manifested most by self-restraint.<p><span class= "bld">Wanting nothing.</span>—The older version, “lacking,” found in Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan Bible seems decidedly better. Here is no wish that the faithful should be free from care, heeding nothing; but rather that their whole lives might be without fault or flaw: a perfect sacrifice, as it were, offered up to God. And this idea is confirmed by reflecting on the original meaning of the word translated “entire” above in the Authorised version=complete, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as an offering, with no blemish.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/james/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>James<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PATIENCE AND HER WORK</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/james/1-4.htm" title="But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.">Jam 1:4</a>IT does not appear from the rest of this letter that the persons to whom it was addressed were under the pressure of any particular trouble or affliction. Seeing that they are ‘the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,’ the width of that superscription makes it improbable that the recipients were undergoing any common experience. It is the more noteworthy, therefore, that at the very outset James gives this exhortation hearing upon trials and troubles. Clearly it is hot, as we often take it to be, a counsel only for the sorrowful, or an address only to a certain class of persons, hut it is a general exhortation applicable to all sorts of people in all conditions of life, and indispensable, as he goes on to say, for any progress in Christian character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Let patience have her perfect work’ is an advice not only for sad hearts, or for those who may be bowed down under any special present trouble, but for us all. And it is the condition on which it is possible, and without which it is impossible, that any Christian man should be ‘perfect and entire, wanting nothing.’ So I want you to look with me, first at what is the scope of this counsel; and then at how it can be obtained; and then why it is so important: what - how - why.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, then, what is the meaning of the counsel to ‘let patience have its perfect work’?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notice that the very language of the text puts aside the common notion that patience is a passive grace. The ‘patience’ of my text does ‘work.’ It is an active thing, whether that work be the virtues that it produces, or, as is more probable, its own preservation, in unbroken activity. In any case, the patience that James would have us all cultivate is an intensely active energy, and not a mere passive endurance. Of course I know that it takes a great deal of active energy to endure passively. There is a terrible strain upon the nerves in lying still on the operating-table without wincing, and letting the surgeon’s knife cut deep without shrinking or screaming. There is much force that goes to standing motionless when the wind is blowing. But, for all that, the mere bearing of trouble by no means covers the whole ground of this royal and supreme virtue to which my text is here exhorting us. For, as I have often had occasion to say, the conception of ‘patience’ in the New Testament includes, indeed, that which is generally supposed to be its sole signification - viz., bearing unresistingly and unmurmuring, and with the full consent of a yielding will, whatever pains, sorrows, losses, troubles, or disappointments may come into our lives, but it includes more than that. It is the fixed determination to ‘bate not one jot of heart or hope, but still bear up, and steer right onwards,’ in spite of all hindrances and antagonisms which may storm against us. It is perseverance in the teeth of the wind, and not merely keeping our place in spite of it, that James exhorts us to here. The ship that lies at anchor, with a strong cable and a firm grip of the flukes in a good holding-ground, and rides out any storm without stirring one fathom’s length from its place, exhibits one form of this perseverance, that is patience. The ship with sails wisely set, and a firm hand at the tiller, and a keen eye on the compass, that uses the utmost blast to hear it nearer its desired haven, and never yaws one hairbreadth from the course that is marked out for it, exhibits the other and the higher form. And that is the kind of thing that the Apostle is here recommending to us - not merely passive endurance, but a brave, active perseverance in spite of antagonisms, in the course that conscience, illuminated by God, has bidden us to run.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And if you want instances of it I will give you two ‘He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.’ All through Christ’s life the shadow of the Cross closed His view; and, unfaltering, unswerving, unresting, unreluctant, He measured every step of the path, and was turned aside by nothing; because ‘for that hour He came into the world,’ and could not blench because He loved.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I will give you another, lower, and yet like, caught from and kindled by, the supreme example of persistence in duty. ‘None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, that I might finish my course with joy.’ The Apostle, who was warned on all sides by voices of prophets, and by tears and by supplications of friends, had his path clearly marked out for him, by his own conscience responsive to the will of God. And that path, whatsoever happened, he was resolved to tread. And that is the temper that my text commands us all to cultivate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beautiful and hard as bearing sorrows rightly may be, that is only a little corner o£ the grace that my text enjoins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so, dear friends, will you let me put the two or three words more that I have to say about this matter into the shape of counsel, not for the sake of dictating, but for the sake of giving point to my words? I would say, then, to every man, bear unmurmuring the burdens and sorrows that each of you have to bear. There are some of us, no doubt, who have some special grief lying at our hearts. There are many of us, I doubt not, who know what it is to have for all the rest of our lives a wound that never can be healed, to carry a weight that never can be lessened, and to walk in a darkness that never can be lightened. Irremediable losses and sorrows are the portion of some of my hearers. Let, patience have her ‘perfect work’; and bow, bow to that supreme and loving will.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, beyond that, do not let all your effort and energy be swallowed up in rightly enduring what you may have to endure. There are many of us who make some disappointment, some loss, some grief, the excuse for shirking plain duty. There is nothing more selfish than sorrow, and there is nothing more absorbing, unless we guard against its tendency to monopolise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Work! Work for others, work for God is our best comforter next to the presence of God’s Divine Spirit. There is nothing that so lightens the weight of a lifelong sorrow as to make it the stimulus to a lifelong devotion; and if our patience has its perfect work it will not make us sit with folded hands, weeping for the days that are no more, but it will drive us into heroic and energetic service, in the midst of which there will come some shadow of consolation or, at least, some blessed oblivion of sorrow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, I weald say, on the wider view of the meaning of this great exhortation, let no antagonism or opposition of any sort come between us and the plain path of Christian service and duty. And remember that the patience of my text has to be applied, not only in reference to the unswerving prosecution of the course which God and our own consciences dictate to us in the face of dificulties, sorrows, and losses, but also to the unswerving prosecution of that same path in the face of the opposite things - earthly delights and pleasures, and the seductions of the world, as well as the darknesses and sorrows of the world. He that lets hie endurance have its perfect work will scorn delights as well as subdue sorrows. The clouds darken, but the sun dazzles. It is not only the rocks that threaten Ulysses and his crew, the sirens sit upon their island home, with their harps of gold, and trill their sweet songs, and no man understands what Christian endurance is who has not learned that he has to ‘endure’ in the face of joys as well as in the face of sorrows, and that persistence in the Christian course means that we shall spurn the one and turn our backs upon the other when either of them threaten to draw us aside from the path.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I might gather all that I have to say about this great queenly virtue of perseverance in the face of antagonisms into the one word of the Apostle, ‘I count them but dung that I may win Christ.’ ‘Forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth unto those that are before, I press toward the mark.’ ‘Let patience have her perfect work.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. And now, secondly, a word as to how this preset may best be carried out. It is a precept. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfecting of Christian endurance is not a thing that comes without effort. And so the Apostle puts it into the shape of an exhortation or an injunction. He does not specify methods, but I may venture to do so, in a few sentences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And I put first and foremost here, as in all regions of Christian excellence and effort, the one specific which makes men like the Master - keeping near Him. As the Epistle to the Hebrews puts it, ‘consider’ {by way of comparison} Him that endured, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. ‘Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Oh, brethren! there is nothing that sucks the brightness out of earthly joys when they threaten to interrupt our course, and dazzle our eyes, like turning our attention to Christ, and looking at Him. And there is nothing that takes the poison-sting, and the irritation consequent on it, out of earthly sorrows like remembering the’ Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.’ Am I to grumble when I think of Him? Shall I make a moan and a mourning for my sorrows when I remember His? Am I to say, ‘O Lord! Thou hast given me as much as I can manage in bearing this terrible blow which Thou hast aimed at me, without repining against Thee. I cannot do any work because I have got so much to bear’? Are we to say that when we remember how He counted not His life dear to Himself, and bore all, and did all, that He might accomplish the Father’s will? Do not let us magnify our griefs, but measure them by the side of Christ’s. Do not let us yield to our impatience, but rather let us think of Him. Consider Him, and patience will have her perfect work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, let me say, if we would possess in its highest degree this indispensable grace of persistent determination to pursue the Christian course in spite of all antagonisms, we must cultivate the habit of thinking of life, in all its vicissitudes, as mainly meant to make character. That is what the Apostle is saying in the context. He says, ‘Brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.’ That is a paradox. It bids a man to be glad because he has trouble and is sad. It seems ridiculous, but the next verse solves the paradox: ‘Knowing this, that the trial of your faith worketh patience.’ That is to say - if I rightly understand the meaning of this world in its bearing on myself, the intention of my whole life to make me what God would have me to be, then I shall not measure things by their capacity to delight and please taste, ambitions, desires, or sense, but only by their power to mould me into His likeness. If I understand that the meanings of sorrow and joy are one, that God intends the same when He gives and when He withdraws, that the fervid suns of autumn and the biting blasts of November equally tend to the production of the harvest, that day and night come from the same cause - the revolution of the earth; if I understand that life is but the scaffolding for building character, and that, if I take out of this world, with all its fading sweets and its fleeting sadnesses, a soul enlarged, ennobled by difficulties and by gladnesses, then I shall welcome them both when they come, and neither the one nor the other will be able to deflect me from my course.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so, lastly, about this matter, I would say bring the future into immediate connection with the present, and that will illuminate the dark places, will minimise the sorrows, will make the crooked things straight and the rough places plain, will prevent joy from being absorbing, and anxiety from being corroding, and sorrow from being monopolising, and will enable us to understand how all that is here is but preparatory and disciplinary for that great and serene future. And so the light affliction, which is but for a moment, will not be so very hard to bear; and the efforts at likeness to Jesus Christ, the consequences of which will last through eternity, will not be so very difficult to keep up; and patience, fed by contemplation of the suffering Christ, and nurtured further by consideration of the purpose of life, and stimulated by the vision of the future to which life here is but the vestibule, will have ‘her perfect work.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. And, lastly, Why is this grace so important? James says, with his favourite repetition of the same word, ‘Let her work be perfect, that ye may be perfect.’ </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such endurance is indispensable to growth in Christian character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I do not need to enter, at this stage of my sermon, on the differences between ‘perfect’ and ‘entire.’ The one describes the measure of the individual graces belonging to the man; the other describes the completeness of the assemblage of such graces. In each he is ‘perfect,’ and, having all that belongs to complete humanity, he is ‘entire.’ That is the ideal to which we have to press.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is an ideal to which we may indefinitely approximate. There are people now - as there always have been - who are apt to substitute emotion and passivity for effort in the path of Christian perfection. I would take James’s teaching. Let your perseverance have her perfect work, and by toil and by protracted effort, and by setting your teeth against all seductions,and by curbing and ruling your sorrows, you will reach the goal. God makes no man perfect without that man’s diligent and continuous struggle and toil, toil, indeed, based upon faith; toil, indeed, which receives the blessing, but toil all the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor need I remind you, I suppose, how, in both the narrower and the wider sense of this word, the perseverance of my text is indispensable to Christian character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I dare say we all of us know some chronic invalid say, on whose worn face there rests a gleam like that of the Lawgiver when He came down from the mount, caused by sorrow rightly borne. If your troubles, be they great or small, do not do you good they do you harm. There is such a thing as being made obstinate, hard, more clinging to earth than before by reason of griefs. And there is such a thing as a sorrow rightly borne being the very strength of a life, and delivering it from many a sin. The alabaster sheet which is intended to be fitted into the lamp is pared very thin that the light may shine through. And God pares away much of our lives in order that through what is left there may gleam more clearly and lambently the light of an indwelling God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is nothing to be won in the perfecting of Christian character without our setting ourselves to it persistently, doggedly, continuously all through our lives. Brethren, be sure of this, you will never grow like Christ by mere wishing, by mere emotion, but only by continual faith, rigid self-control, and by continual struggle. And be as sure of this, you will never miss the mark if, ‘forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth to those that are before,’ you ‘let patience have her perfect work,’ and press towards Him who is Himself the Author and Finisher of our patience and of our faith.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But let patience have her perfect work - Let it be fairly developed; let it produce its appropriate effects without being hindered. Let it not be obstructed in its fair influence on the soul by murmurings, complaining, or rebellion. Patience under trials is fitted to produce important effects on the soul, and we are not to hinder them in any manner by a perverse spirit, or by opposition to the will of God. Every one who is afflicted should desire that the fair effects of affliction should be produced on his mind, or that there should be produced in his soul precisely the results which his trials are adapted to accomplish.<p>That ye may be perfect and entire - The meaning of this is explained in the following phrase - "wanting nothing;" that is, that there may be nothing lacking to complete your character. There may be the elements of a good character; there may be sound principles, but those principles may not be fully carried out so as to show what they are. Afflictions, perhaps more than anything else, will do this, and we should therefore allow them to do all that they are adapted to do in developing what is good in us. The idea here is, that it is desirable not only to have the elements or principles of piety in the soul, but to have them fairly carried out, so as to show what is their real tendency and value.

The verification of faith effected by the <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοί</span> produces <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>, and on this account temptations should be to the Christian an object of joy, as it depends on them that <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> is of the right kind. This is indicated in this verse. Oecumenius rightly observes: <span class="greekheb">σκόπει οὐκ εἶπε τὴν ὑπομονὴν ὁριστικῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἔργον τέλειον ἔχει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ προστακτικῶς ἐχέτω</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ προϋποκειμένην ἀρετὴν ἐξαγγέλλει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ νῦν ἐγγινομένην</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς χρὴ γίνεσθαι νομοθετεῖ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτω</span>] The emphasis is not placed on <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span>,—that <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> has an <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> is understood of itself,—but on <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span> (Wiesinger). James wishes that the <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> of <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> among Christians be <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span>, in order that they may be <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span>: as he, moreover, strongly emphasizes <span class="greekheb">τέλειον εἶναι</span>. In explaining the thought, de Wette confounds the abstract (<span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>) with the concrete (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ὑπομένων</span>), and understands by <span class="greekheb">ἔργον τέλειον</span> “the active virtue which the patient man must perfectly have.” This explanation of de Wette agrees in essentials with the explanations of Erasmus, Calovius, Morus, Pott, Augusti, Gebser, Kern, Schneckenburger, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἔργον τέλειον</span> is distinguished from <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>, and the moral activity which the Christian has to exercise with his <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> indicated. Thus Erasmus: quemadmodum in malis tolerandis fortis est et alacris, ita in bonis operibus exercendis sibi constet. Pott: perseverantiae fructus sit perfectum virtutis studium. This interpretation is, however, incorrect; it not only gives rise to unjustifiable changes of meaning, as that of <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> into <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὑπομένων</span>, or of <span class="greekheb">ἐχέτω</span> into <span class="greekheb">παρεχέτω</span> (Pott), or into <span class="greekheb">κρατείτω</span> (Schulthess), but gives also a thought which with the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. would be tautological. Most expositors (even Brückner,[41] in opposition to de Wette) refer <span class="greekheb">ἔργον τέλειον</span> to <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> itself; <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> = work, <span class="ital">realization</span> (Wiesinger); comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a> : <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔργον τῆς πίστεως</span>; for the <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> of the Christian is not only a <span class="ital">suffering</span>, but even more a <span class="ital">doing.</span> This doing is to be <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span>, that is, not only, as many interpreters explain, <span class="ital">enduring to the end</span> (Luther: “patience is to continue stedfast to the end;” Calvin: haec vera crit patientia, quae in finem usque durabit; similarly Jerome, Serarius, Salmero, Estius, Gomarus, Piscator, Piraeus, Hornejus, Carpzov, Semler, Hottinger, etc.), but <span class="ital">complete</span>, and that not only in respect of its <span class="ital">internal condition</span>,—so that it is wanting in no essential points of true <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>,—but also in respect of its <span class="ital">activity</span> (Lange[42]), so that it in no way yields to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΙΡΑΣΜΟῖς</span></span></span>, which yielding occurs when a man by the temptations is determined to something which does not correspond with the principle of faith. Bouman: Haec <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΜΟΝΉ</span></span></span> consummatum opus habet, quando ita se gerit, in quo habitat, homo, ut universam per vitam et animum et linguam et pedes regat ac moderetur.

This James indicates in the following words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ἮΤΕ ΤΈΛΕΙΟΙ ΚΑῚ ὉΛΌΚΛΗΡΟΙ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> is not here <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΒΑΤΙΚῶς</span></span></span> (which Baumgarten and Pott regard as possible), but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΙΚῶς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">in order that.</span> De Wette and Wiesinger incorrectly refer it to the future judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΛΌΚΛΗΡΟΙ</span></span></span> are synonymous terms; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΈΛΕΙΟς</span></span></span> is properly “that which has attained its aim,” <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΛΌΚΛΗΡΟς</span></span></span> “that which is complete in all its parts, is entire.” Both expressions are found in the LXX. as the translation of <span class="greekheb">תָּמִים</span> (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm" title="Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?">Ezekiel 15:5</a>); besides this verse, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΛΌΚΛΗΡΟς</span></span></span> in the N. T. only occurs in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" title="Brothers, pray for us.">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΛΟΚΛΗΡΊΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>).[43] It is true that both <span class="greekheb">τέλειος</span> (in the LXX. and in the classics) and <span class="greekheb">ὁλόκληρος</span> (particularly in Philo, but not in the LXX.) are used with special reference to sacrifice; to which, however, there is here no allusion (against Kern). Still more arbitrary is the interpretation of Storr: qui superiores e certamine discedebant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι</span>] the negative expression added for strengthening the two positive expressions; as in <a href="/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">Jam 1:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἁπλῶς καὶ μὴ ὀνειδίζοντος</span>, and in <a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span>, <span class="greekheb">μηδὲν διακρινόμενος</span>. As regards the expression itself, <span class="greekheb">ἐν μηδενί</span> is not to be taken, with de Wette, as a supplement to <span class="greekheb">λειπόμενοι</span>, as the supplement to this verb is always in the genitive; therefore the expression has been correctly translated by Wiesinger and in this commentary, not by wanting nothing, but by wanting <span class="ital">in</span> nothing (which Lange has overlooked). The question, however, occurs, can <span class="greekheb">λειπόμενοι</span> be explained as = <span class="ital">wanting?</span> This idea is not contained in the verb by itself, and therefore can hardly be attributed to it when it stands absolutely, as here. It is therefore safer to take <span class="greekheb">λείπεσθαι</span> in its usual meaning, and thus, with Lange, to explain <span class="greekheb">λειπόμενοι</span> by <span class="ital">coming short of</span>, namely, short of the goal marked out to the Christian. It is incorrect, with Pott, to say: tota loquendi ratio ab iis qui cursu … relinquuntur et seperantur (so also Lösner, Krebs, Storr, Augusti); for although the verb in classical writers has often this reference, yet there is here no mention of a relation to others, and accordingly the appeal to Polybius, p. 1202, ed. Gronov.: <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ πρὸς Ῥωμαίους εὐνοίᾳ παρὰ πολὺ τἀδελφοῦ λειπόμενος</span>, does not suit. According to the meaning here given, <span class="greekheb">λειπόμενοι</span> forms a strong contrast to <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] “Nothing else can be meant than the perfect work of endurance, particularly as different stages of this are conceivable.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] Lange here arbitrarily understands by <span class="greekheb">ἔργον τέλειον</span> specially: “the unreserved acknowledgment of their Gentile-Christian brethren, the open rupture with Jewish pride of faith and fanaticism.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] A limitation of this idea to <span class="ital">moral</span> perfection is not required by the context. Lange has the following strange remark: “The Jew was a symbolical <span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span> of the household; as a Christian he was to become a real <span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span>, and thus <span class="greekheb">ὁλόκληρος</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/1-4.htm" title="But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.">Jam 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτω</span>: “But let endurance have its perfect result”; the possibility of losing heart is contemplated, which would result in something being lacking; the words recall what is said in the <span class="ital">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, <a href="/joshua/2-7.htm" title="And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.">Joshua 2:7</a>. “For endurance (<span class="greekheb">μακροθυμία</span>) is a mighty charm, and patience (<span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>) giveth many good things”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;">Romans 5:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἦτε τέλειοι</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.">Matthew 19:21</a>; see Lightfoot’s note on the meaning of this word in <a href="/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Php 3:15</a>, “the <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span> are in fact the same with <span class="greekheb">πνευματικοί</span>” (<span class="ital">Ep. to the Philippians</span>, p. 153).

Thus Peter (<a href="/acts/3-16.htm">Acts 3:16</a>) says of the restored cripple, "faith has given him this perfect soundness (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;). Compare the familiar phrase, an accomplished man. Note, also, James' repetition of the key-words of his discourse, rejoice, joy, patience, perfect.<p>Wanting nothing (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., more literally, lacking in nothing. Note James' characteristic corroboration of a positive statement by a negative clause: entire, lacking in nothing ; God that giveth and upbraideth not; in faith, nothing doubting. The conditional negative &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;, nothing, is used, rather than the absolute negative &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;, as implying nothing which may be supposed ; no possible thing. </body></html>
