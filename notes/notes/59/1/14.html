From without come the whispers of Satan, by himself or his legionaries, skilled in all that may entice and delude the unwary soul. And if the doctrine be true that to every one a guardian angel is appointed, so also would seem to be the opposite idea, that each has some demon of the pit watching him incessantly, and commissioned specially for his utter destruction. How terrible must be the skill of such assailants, experienced in the arts which have deceived mankind since the first fatal day. But there is the limit of external power in this matter; the ablest and subtlest fiend can but guess what is passing in its victim’s mind, and shape its snares accordingly. God only is the discerner of hearts, and the “spirit of man which is in him” alone, with its Maker, “knoweth the things of a man” (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 2:11</a>). The Holy Spirit “searcheth all things” (<a href="/james/1-10.htm" title="But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.">James 1:10</a>), and all are manifest in His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm" title="Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.">Hebrews 4:13</a>), but to no less than His own omniscience. Satan, therefore, can merely act on his general knowledge of human nature, aided by particular guesses at the individual before him, whom he fain would destroy. He has learned too well the deep corruption of the heart, and knows what gaudy bait will most attract the longing and licentious eyes.<p><span class= "bld">Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of </span>(or, <span class= "ital">by</span>)<span class= "bld"> his own lust, and enticed.</span>—Evil humanity thrills responsive as a harp played by a cunning hand; but no power of hell can force its way through the barriers which God the Holy Ghost erects around the faithful and confiding soul: only by treason of the man himself can the great enemy enter in and reign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/james/1-14.htm" title="But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed....">James 1:14-15</a>. </span><span class="ital">But every man is tempted when — </span>In the beginning of the temptation; <span class="ital">he is drawn away of his own lust </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">υπο της ιδιας επιθυμιας εξελκομενος</span>; literally, he is <span class="ital">drawn out </span>of God, his strong refuge, <span class="ital">by his own desire; </span>excited by some external object presenting itself; <span class="ital">and enticed </span>— <span class="greekheb">Δελεαζομενος</span>, <span class="ital">caught with a bait. </span>It is generally supposed that the allusion here is to the drawing of fish out of a river with a baited hook: a metaphor used by Plato, as quoted by Cicero, (<span class="ital">De Senect., </span>cap. 13,) “Divine enim Plato, escam malorum appellat voluptatem; quod ea videlicet homines capiantur ut hamo pisces.” <span class="ital">Plato divinely calls pleasure a bait of evil things; namely, because by it men are taken as fishes by a hook. </span>With regard to most temptations that draw men into sin, the case seems to be thus: 1st, An outward object presents itself, which appears to be desirable, either on account of the profit or pleasure it seems calculated to afford; 2d, Through an inordinate love of ease, honour, wealth, or pleasure, a desire of that object arises in a man’s corrupt heart; 3d, That desire is yielded to, instead of being resisted, and thereby he is drawn from that line of duty in which he before walked, and from that state of union and communion with God which he enjoyed, and is entangled in the guilt and misery of sin. We are therefore to look for the causes of every sin chiefly in ourselves; in our appetites, passions, and corrupt inclinations. Even the injections of the devil cannot hurt us, till we make them our own, by entertaining and yielding to them. Then, <span class="ital">when lust, </span>desire, <span class="ital">hath conceived </span>— By obtaining the consent of our will, that is, when it is yielded to; <span class="ital">it bringeth forth </span>actual <span class="ital">sin </span>— By a speedy birth, where, perhaps, the full indulgence of the desire was not at first intended. It does not follow from this, that the desire itself is not sin. He that begets a man is himself a man; <span class="ital">and sin, when it is finished </span>— Actually committed; <span class="ital">bringeth forth death </span>— Tends, in its consequences, to the final ruin of both soul and body, as naturally as the conception of an animal does to its birth. Indeed, sin is born big with death. Thus St. James “represents men’s lust as a harlot, which entices their understanding and will into its impure embraces, and from that conjunction conceives sin. And sin, being brought forth and nourished by frequent repetitions, in its turn begets death, which destroys the sinner. This is the true genealogy of sin and death. Lust is the mother of sin, and sin the mother of death; and the sinner the parent of both. <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>, the apostle gives the genealogy of righteousness. All the righteous deeds which men perform, and the holy designs and desires, intentions and affections, which are found in them, proceed from their renewed nature; and their nature is renewed by the power of truth and grace; and God is the prime mover in the whole.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust - That is, the fountain or source of all temptation is in man himself. It is true that external inducements to sin may be placed before him, but they would have no force if there was not something in himself to which they corresponded, and over which they might have power. There must be some "lust;" some desire; some inclination; something which is unsatisfied now, which is made the foundation of the temptation, and which gives it all its power. If there were no capacity for receiving food, or desire for it, objects placed before us appealing to the appetite could never be made a source of temptation; if there were nothing in the soul which could be regarded as the love of acquisition or possession, gold would furnish no temptation; if there were no sensual propensities, we should be in that quarter above the power of temptation.<p>In each case, and in every form, the power of the temptation is laid in some propensity of our nature, some desire of that which we do not now possess. The word rendered "lust" in this place (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  epithumias), is not employed here in the narrow sense in which it is now commonly used, as denoting libidinousness. It means desire in general; an earnest wish for anything. Notes, <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>. It seems here to be used with reference to the original propensities of our nature - the desires implanted in us, which are a stimulus to employment - as the desire of knowledge, of food, of power, of sensual gratifications; and the idea is, that a man may be drawn along by these beyond the prescribed limits of indulgence, and in the pursuit of objects that are forbidden. He does not stop at the point at which the law requires him to stop, and is therefore guilty of transgression. This is the source of all sin. The original propensity may not be wrong, but may be perfectly harmless - as in the case of the desire of food, etc. Nay, it may furnish a most desirable stimulus to action; for how could the human powers be called forth, if it were not for this? The error, the fault, the sin, is, not restraining the indulgence where we are commanded to do it, either in regard to the objects sought, or in regard to the degree of indulgence.<p>And enticed - Entrapped, caught; that is, he is seized by this power, and held fast; or he is led along and beguiled, until he falls into sin, as in a snare that springs suddenly upon him.<p>&#x395;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  Epithumia in the New Testament, is sometimes employed in a good sense, <a href="/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; often in a bad sense, as in <a href="/mark/4-19.htm">Mark 4:19</a>; <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>; <a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>; <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>; but there is no difficulty in making the distinction; the context easily determining the matter. And this passage in James seems at once to fix down on &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  epithumias the sense of evil or corrupt desire. That it can mean a "harmless propensity;" or that it is a propensity on whose character the apostle does not at all pronounce, is incredible. It is said to "draw away a man and entice him;" to "conceive and bring forth sin:" and a principle from which such fruit springs cannot be very harmless. Without doubt, the apostle traces the whole evil of temptation, which some falsely ascribed to God, to the sinful desires of the human heart; and, as our author remarks, he seems to take the common sense view without entertaining any thought of nice philosophical distinction. We cannot for a moment suppose the apostle to say - "the evil is not to be traced to God, but to a harmless propensity."<p>The whole passage, with the words and figures which are used, show that the idea in the apostle's mind was that of an enticing harlot. The &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  epithumia is personified. She persuades the understanding and will into her impure embrace. The result of this fatal union is the "conception" and ultimate "bringing forth" of actual sin, which again brings forth death. This is the true genealogy of sin (McKnight); and to say that the &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  epithumia, or evil desire, of which the apostle says that it is the "origo mali," is harmless, - is to contradict him, and Paul also, who in a parallel passage says that he had not known the &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  epithumia, or inward desire after forbidden objects, to be sinful, unless the law had enlightened him and said "thou shalt not covet." Mr. Scott has spoken in strong terms of the folly of some parties who understand &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  epithumia. Here only of the desire of sensual gross indulgence, to the exclusion of other sinful desires; but the extreme of interpreting it as meaning nothing sinful at all, deserves equal reprehension. The reader, however, will notice that the author does not venture on this assertion. He says "it may be so," and otherwise modifies his view.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Every man, when tempted, is so through being drawn away of (again here, as in Jas 1:13, the Greek for "of" expresses the actual source, rather than the agent of temptation) his own lust. The cause of sin is in ourselves. Even Satan's suggestions do not endanger us before they are made our own. Each one has his own peculiar (so the Greek) lust, arising from his own temperament and habit. Lust flows from the original birth-sin in man, inherited from Adam.<p>drawn away&#8212;the beginning step in temptation: drawn away from truth and virtue.<p>enticed&#8212;literally, "taken with a bait," as fish are. The further progress: the man allowing himself (as the Greek middle voice implies) to be enticed to evil [Bengel]. "Lust" is here personified as the harlot that allures the man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He shows the great cause of sin; that lust hath a greater hand in it than either the devil or his instruments, who cannot make us sin without ourselves: they sometimes tempt, and do not prevail; but when lust tempts, it always prevails, either in whole or in part, it being a degree of sin to be our own tempters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Drawn away; </span> either this notes a degree of sin, the heart’s being drawn off from God; or the way whereby lust brings into sin, viz. the impetuousness and violence of its motions in us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of his own lust; </span> original corruption in its whole latitude, though chiefly with respect to the appetitive faculties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And enticed; </span> either a further degree of sin, <span class="ital">enticed</span> by the pleasantness of the object, as represented by our own corruption; or another way of lust’s working in us to sin, viz. by the delightfulness and pleasure of its motions: in the former it works by a kind of force, in this by flattery and deceit. It is either a metaphor taken from a fish enticed by a bait, and drawn after it, or rather from a harlot drawing a young man out of the right way, and alluring him with the bait of pleasure to commit folly with her. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/james/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But every man is tempted,.... To sin, and he falls in with the temptation, and by it, <p>when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed; the metaphor is taken either from fishes, who are enticed by the bait, and drawn out by the hook; or from a lascivious woman, who meeting with a young man, entices him, and draws him away after her to commit iniquity with her: by "lust" is meant the principle of corrupt nature, which has its residence in the heart of man; is natural and hereditary to him, and therefore is called his own; he is conceived and shapen in it; he brings it into the world with him, and it continues in him, and is called his own heart's lust, <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>. Now this meeting with some bait, which entices and draws it out, or with some external object, which promises pleasure or profit, a man is allured, and ensnared, and drawn away by it, and so the temptation begins: thus, for instance, covetousness was the predominant lust in Judas; this meeting with an external object, or objects, which promised him profit, he is at once enticed and drawn away to betray his Lord and master for the sake of it: so sin often promises pleasure, though it is but an imaginary, and a short lived one; which takes with a man's own lust, and corruption within him, and so he is allured and drawn aside; and to this, and not to God, should he attribute temptation to sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/1-14.htm" title="But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.">Jam 1:14</a>.

The meaning: protrahere in littus (Pott, and also de Wette), does not here lie at the root of the idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΈΛΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἍΠΑΞ ΛΕΓ</span></span></span>. in N.

Many interpreters (Menochius, Grotius, Laurentius, Pott, Hottinger, Baumgarten, Theile, and others) supply <span class="ital">a bono</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἐξέλκ</span>. and <span class="ital">ad malum</span> to <span class="greekheb">δελεάζ</span>., or something similar; yet incorrectly, as the idea is rather that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΘΥΜΊΑ</span></span></span> as a harlot entices man, that is, his <span class="ital">will</span>, to herself; the <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΈΛΚ</span></span></span>. is thus to be explained, that man, enticed by the allurements of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΘΥΜΊΑ</span></span></span>, is enticed to forsake his former position (as the place where he remained hitherto concealed); Schneckenburger: statu quasi suo et loco se extrahi et dimoveri ipse patitur. It is incorrect to explain <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΈΛΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΈΛΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, or as an intensified form instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΛΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span>.[72] The being taken, captive by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΘΥΜΊΑ</span></span></span> is indicated by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΕΛΕΑΖΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>.[73] <span class="greekheb">δελεάζειν</span>, in the N.

It is also incorrect, with Lange, to understand by <span class="greekheb">ἴδια ἐπιθ</span>. “original sin itself in its concrete activity,” or “the folly which the individual encounters externally, over against which the lust belonging to him is objectively placed,” and to determine the same more definitely as the totality of those “glittering, variegated, visionary expectations which seductively met both the Jews and the Jewish Christians, which had sprung from, the matter of the chiliastic, world-lusting, spiritual pride.” James does not here speak of <span class="greekheb">ἑπιθυμία</span> as attacking an individual from outside, but <span class="ital">only</span> of that which is within him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] See Athenaeus, i. 3, c. 8: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν ὁμιλίαν τοὺς ἐραστὰς προσελκυσασθαι</span>.

Both words had come to be used figuratively of sensual passion, the latter twice by St Peter (<a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2 Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>), and the imagery that follows here suggests the thought that St James had the picture of the harlot of <a href="/context/proverbs/7-6.htm" title="For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,...">Proverbs 7:6-23</a> present to his thoughts. There the “young man void of understanding” yields to her allurements as “a bird hasteth to the snare.” “Lust,” or rather, <span class="bld">desire</span>, in its widest sense, including desire for safety, riches, ease, as well as sensual pleasure, is to man’s will as the harlot-temptress of that picture. The temptations of which the earlier verses of the Chapter had spoken are thus, though no longer prominent, not excluded. Adversity and persecution expose men to the evil solicitations of their lower nature, to love of ease and safety, no less than luxury and prosperity. In both “desire” tempts the will to depart from what it knows to be the will of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-14.htm" title="But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.">Jam 1:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἕκαστος</span>, <span class="ital">every man</span>) Antithetical to <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα</span>, “<span class="ital">no man</span>,” <a href="/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">Jam 1:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ</span>, <span class="ital">by</span>) Lust is, as it were, the harlot; human nature, the man.—<span class="greekheb">ἰδίας</span>, <span class="ital">his own</span>) We ought therefore to seek the cause of sin in ourselves, and not without us.
