It is here put in the very forefront of necessity; without it all prayer is useless. And mark the addition—<p><span class= "bld">Nothing wavering.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">doubting nothing</span>: reechoing the words of our Saviour to the wondering disciples, as they gazed at the withered fig-tree on the road to Bethany (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>). This “doubting” is the halting between belief and unbelief, with inclination towards the latter. But it may be asked by some one, whence and how is an unhesitating faith to be gained? And the reply to this will solve all similar questions: faith, in its first sense, is the direct gift of God; but it must be tended and used with love and zeal, or its precious faculties will soon be gone. In the hour of some besetting thought of unbelief “the shield of faith” will “quench all the fiery darts of the wicked” (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>), but that shield must be lifted up, as it were, in an act of faith. “There is no God—at least, to care for me,” may be the hopeless cry, responsive to a cruel wound of the enemy. Let the battle-hymn of the Christian make quick answer, “I believe in God;” and often, with that very effort, the assault will cease for awhile. Further, let us take comfort in the thought that intellectual is not moral doubt: the unorthodox are not as the adulterous. Nevertheless, intellectual doubt may spring from an evil habit of carping criticism and self-opinion, for the foundation of which, in so far as a man himself has been either the wilful or the careless cause, he must bear the curse of its results.<p><span class= "bld">For he that wavereth</span> (or, <span class= "ital">douhteth</span>) <span class= "bld">is like a</span> <span class= "bld">wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span>—<span class= "ital">Doubteth</span> is preferable to “wavereth”; there is no play on the Greek words, as in the English text—“wavereth” and “wave.” Like storm-beaten sailors, the doubtful are “carried” up to heaven and down again to the deep; their soul melteth away because of the trouble (<a href="/psalms/107-26.htm" title="They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.">Psalm 107:26</a>). And who can describe the terror, even of the faithful, in those hours of darkness when the face of the Lord is hidden; when, as with the disciples of old, the ship is in the midst of the sea, tossed with the bitter waves. Nevertheless, the raging wind will clear the heavens soon from clouds, and by the radiance of the peaceful moon we too may behold our Helper near—the Lord Jesus walking on the sea—and if He come into the ship the storm must cease.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But let him ask in faith - See the passages referred to in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>. Compare the <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a> note, and <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> note. We cannot hope to obtain any favor from God if there is not faith; and where, as in regard to the wisdom necessary to guide us, we are sure that it is in accordance with his will to grant it to us, we may come to him with the utmost confidence, the most entire assurance, that it will be granted. In this case, we should come to God without a doubt that, if we ask with a proper spirit, the very thing that we ask will be bestowed on us. We cannot in all other cases be so sure that what we ask will be for our good, or that it will be in accordance with his will to bestow it; and hence, we cannot in such cases come with the same kind of faith. We can then only come with unwavering confidence in God, that he will do what is right and best; and that if he sees that what we ask will be for our good, he will bestow it upon us. Here, however, nothing prevents our coming with the assurance that the very thing which we ask will be conferred on us.<p>Nothing wavering - (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  me&#772;den diakrinomenos.)

In regard to the matter under consideration, there is to be no hesitancy, no doubting, no vacillation of the mind. We are to come to God with the utmost confidence and assurance.<p>For he that wavereth, is like a wave of the sea ... - The propriety and beauty of this comparison will be seen at once. The wave of the sea has no stability. It is at the mercy of every wind, and seems to be driven and tossed every way. So he that comes to God with unsettled convictions and hopes, is liable to be driven about by every new feeling that may spring up in the mind. At one moment, hope and faith impel him to come to God; then the mind is at once filled with uncertainty and doubt, and the soul is agitated and restless as the ocean. Compare <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>. Hope on the one hand, and the fear of not obtaining the favor which is desired on the other, keep the mind restless and discomposed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. ask in faith&#8212;that is, the persuasion that God can and will give.

The opinion that <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμίζ</span>. refers to agitation coming from <span class="ital">without</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ῥιπίζ</span>. to agitation coming from <span class="ital">within</span> (Bengel), is without foundation; also the assertion that the former word denotes the <span class="ital">cause</span> and the latter the <span class="ital">effect</span> (Theile, Wiesinger) is not entirely correct, as <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμίζεσθαι</span> itself expresses the effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By this image the mind of the doubter is characterized as unsteady and wavering, to which a calm and sure rest is wanting.[51] Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt....">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ ἄδικοι κλυδωνισθήσονται καὶ ἀναπαύσασθαι οὐ δυνήσονται</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστι χαίρειν</span> (<span class="greekheb">שָׁלוֹם</span>) <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν</span>.[52]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[49] As weak faith is to be distinguished from <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span>, so also is the doubt, of which the believer is conscious as a trial. Calvin strikingly remarks: Fieri quidem non potest in (hac) carnis infirmitate, quin variis tentationibus agitemur, quae sunt veluti machinae ad labefactandam nostram fiduciam: ita nemo reperietur, qui non sensu carnis suae vacillet ac trepidet. Sed oportet ejusmodi tentationes fide tandem superari, quemadmodum arbor, quae firmas radices jecit, quatitur quidem venti impulsu, sed non revellitur, quin potius suo loco stabilis manet.—Whilst the <span class="greekheb">διακρινόμενος</span>, according to the proper meaning of the term, will not believe, it is the longing of the tried to be confirmed in the faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] Theile correctly rejects this explanation, saying: “Hoc, quamquam undae spumantes ventis revera incalescunt Latinisque etiam ebullire aestusque dicuntur, longius tamen petitum est.”—The verb <span class="greekheb">ῥιπίζειν</span> comes either from <span class="greekheb">ῥιπίς</span> = (1) <span class="ital">follis</span> (a bellows); (2) <span class="ital">flabellum</span>, having the meaning both of kindling (the fire) and of fanning (for the sake of cooling); or from <span class="greekheb">ῥιπή</span> = vibration, which is also used of wind; thus <span class="greekheb">ῥιπὴ Βορέαο</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xv. 171; <span class="greekheb">ῥιπαὶ ἀνέμων</span>, Sophocles, <span class="ital">Ant.</span> 137; also <span class="greekheb">ῥιπή</span> = storm, Pind. P. ix. 49. The original import of the German verbs <span class="ital">schwingen, bewegen</span>, is thus entirely equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμίζειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] “A doubtful petitioner offers not to God a steady hand or heart, so that God cannot deposit in it His gift,” Stier.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] Lange supposes that James has used these expressions with a conscious reference to the O. T. symbols, according to which the sea is “the emblem of the national life, agitated hither and thither in pathological sympathies,” whilst in his time “these waves of the sea” had already begun to roar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span>: <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, as used in this Epistle, refers to the state of mind in which a man not only believes in the existence of God, but in which His ethical character is apprehended and the evidence of His good-will towards man is acknowledged; it is a belief in the beneficent activity, as well as in the personality, of God; it includes reliance on God and the expectation that what is asked for will be granted by Him. The word here does not connote faith in the sense of a body of doctrine. This idea of faith is not specifically Christian; it was, and is, precisely that of the Jews; with these <span class="greekheb">אמונה</span> (<span class="ital">Emûnah</span>) is just that perfect trust in God which is expressed in what is called the “Creed of Maimonides,” or the “Thirteen principles of faith”; it is there said: “I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His name, is the Author and Guide of everything that has been created, and that He alone has made, does make, and will make all things”. In Talmudical literature, which, in this as in so much else, embodies much ancient material, the Rabbis constantly insist on the need of faith as being that which is “perfect trust in God”; the <span class="ital">měchûsarê ’amanah</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “those who are lacking in faith,” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/6-30.htm" title="Why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?">Matthew 6:30</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὀλιγόπιστοι</span> = <span class="greekheb">קטני אמונה</span>) are held up to rebuke; it is said in <span class="ital">Sotah</span>, ix. 12 that the disappearance of “men of faith” will bring about the downfall of the world. Faith therefore, in the sense in which it is used in this Epistle, was the characteristic mark of the Jew as well as of the Christian. In reference to <span class="greekheb">αἰτείτω δὲ ἐν πίστε</span>: Knowling draws attention to Hermas, <span class="ital">Mand.</span>, ix. 6, 7; Sim., <a href="/james/1-4.htm" title="But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.">Jam 1:4</a>; <a href="/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">Jam 1:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μηδὲν διακρινόμενος</span>: <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> means to be in a critical state of mind, which is obviously the antithesis to that of him who has faith; it excludes faith <span class="ital">ipso facto; Cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>, <span class="ital">If ye have faith and doubt not</span> (<span class="greekheb">μὴ διακριθῆτε</span>) …; Aphraates quotes as a saying of our Lord’s: “Doubt not, that ye sink not into the world, as Simon, when he doubted, began to sink into the sea”.—<span class="greekheb">ἔοικεν κλύδωνι θαλάσσης</span>: a very vivid picture; the instability of a billow, changing from moment to moment, is a wonderfully apt symbol of a mind that cannot fix itself in belief. <span class="greekheb">ἔοικεν</span> occurs only here and in <a href="/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">Jam 1:23</a> in the N.T., <span class="greekheb">κλύδων</span> only elsewhere in <a href="/luke/8-24.htm" title="And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish.

Faith, i.e. trust in God, as distinct from belief in a dogma, is with him, as with St Paul, of the very essence of the spiritual life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nothing wavering</span>] Better, “nothing <span class="bld">doubting</span>.” Another echo from our Lord’s teaching (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>). The variations in the English version hinder us from seeing that St Paul, when he said that “Abraham <span class="ital">staggered</span> not at the promise of God … but was strong in faith” (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>), was reproducing the very thought and language of St James. The primary idea of the verb used, as here, in the middle voice, is that of the inner “debating” which implies doubt. It does not involve the absolute negation of unbelief, though, as in <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>, it tends to this, but represents the state of one who meets the question, “Will God keep His promise?” now with <span class="ital">Yes</span>, and now with <span class="ital">No</span>. The words of our own poet,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Faith and Unfaith can ne’er be equal powers,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tennyson’s <span class="ital">Merlin and Vivien</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>reproduce the substance of St James’s teaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that wavereth is like a wave</span>] Better, <span class="bld">he that doubteth</span>. The English play upon the word, though happy in itself, has nothing corresponding to it in the Greek. Wycliffe gives “doubt”. Tyndal introduced “waver” in the previous clause, but kept “doubteth” in this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">driven with the wind and tossed</span>] Better, <span class="bld">driven by the winds and blasts</span>, both words describing the action of a storm at sea, the latter pointing especially to sudden gusts and squalls. The image, true at all times and for all nations, was specially forcible for a people to whom, like the Jews, the perils of the sea were comparatively unfamiliar. Comp. the description of the storm in <a href="/proverbs/23-34.htm" title="Yes, you shall be as he that lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he that lies on the top of a mast.">Proverbs 23:34</a> and the comparison of the wicked to the “troubled sea” in <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a>. Popular speech likens a man who has no stedfastness to a ship drifting on the troubled waves of life. St James goes one step farther and likens him to the unresting wave itself. Now he is in the depths, now uplifted high. In <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a> the same image describes those who are “carried about by every wind of doctrine.” So far as St James wrote from personal experience we trace, perhaps, a recollection of stormy nights upon the Sea of Galilee. If we could identify him with the son of Zebedee, we might think of him as remembering such a night as that of <a href="/matthew/8-24.htm" title="And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.">Matthew 8:24</a> or <a href="/john/6-18.htm" title="And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.">John 6:18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

The word is admirably chosen, as by a writer who lived near the sea and was familiar with its aspects. The general distinction between this and the more common &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, wave, is that &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; describes the long ridges of water as they are propelled in horizontal lines over the vast surface of the sea; while &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; denotes the pointed masses which toss themselves up from these under the action of the wind. Hence the word &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; here is explained, and the picture completed by what follows: a billow or surge, driven by the wind in lines, and tossed into waves. Both here and in the passage in Luke the word is used in connection with the wind. It emphasizes the idea of extension, while the other word throws forward the idea of concentrating into a crest at a given point. Hence, in the figure, the emphasis falls on the tossing; not only moving before the impulse of the wind, but not even moving in regular lines; tossed into rising and falling peaks.<p>Driven by the wind (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Only here in New Testament.<p>Tossed (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
