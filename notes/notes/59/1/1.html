But there is something figurative, and perhaps prophetic, in the number twelve. Strictly speaking, at the time this Epistle was written, Judah and Benjamin, in great measure, were returned to the Holy Land from their captivity, though numbers of both tribes were living in various parts of the world, chiefly engaged, as at the present day, in commerce. The remaining ten had lost their tribal distinctions, and have now perished from all historical record, though it is still one of the fancies of certain writers, rather pious than learned, to discover traces of them in the aborigines of America, Polynesia, and almost every where else; most ethnologically improbable of all, in the Teutonic nations, and our own families thereof. But long before the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, and even the preaching of Christianity, Jewish colonists were found in Europe as well as Asia. “Even where they suffered most, through their own turbulent disposition, or the enmity of their neighbours, they sprang again from the same undying stock, however it might be hewn by the sword or seared by the fire. Massacre seemed to have no effect in thinning their ranks, and, like their forefathers in Egypt, they still multiplied under the most cruel oppression.” (See Milman’s <span class= "ital">History of the Jews, </span>vol. i., p. 449, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) While the Temple stood these scattered settlements were colonies of a nation, bound together by varied ties and sympathies, but ruled in the East by a Rabbi called the Prince of the Captivity, and in the West by the Patriarch of Tiberias, who, curiously, had his seat in that Gentile city of Palestine. The fall of Jerusalem, and the end therewith of national existence, rather added to than detracted from the authority of these strange governments; the latter ceased only in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, while the former continued, it is said, in the royal line of David, until the close of the eleventh century, after which the dominion passed wholly into the hands of the Rabbinical aristocracy, from whom it has come down to the present day. The phrase “in the dispersion” was common in the time or our Lord; the Jews wondered whether He would “go unto the dispersion amongst the Gentiles” (<a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>, and see <span class= "ital">Note</span> there).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">James, a servant of Jesus Christ — </span>Whose name the apostle mentions but once more in the whole epistle, namely, <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>, and not at all in his whole discourse, <a href="/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>, &c., or <a href="/context/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:...">Acts 21:20-25</a>.

That the twelve tribes were actually in existence when James wrote his epistle, will appear from the following facts. 1st, Notwithstanding Cyrus allowed all the Jews in his dominions to return to their own land, many of them did not return, but continued to live among the Gentiles, as appears from this, that in the days of Ahasuerus, one of the successors of Cyrus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, (<a href="/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>,) <span class="ital">the Jews were dispersed among the people in all the provinces of his</span> <span class="ital">kingdom, and their laws were diverse from the laws of all other people; </span>so that, by adhering to their own usages, they kept themselves distinct from all the nations among whom they lived. 2d, Josephus considered the twelve tribes as being in existence when the Old Testament Scriptures were translated into Greek, (namely, in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, about two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty years before Christ,) as he says that six persons were sent out of every tribe to assist in that work. 3d, On the day of pentecost, as mentioned <a href="/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9</a>, <span class="ital">there were dwelling at Jerusalem devout men out of every nation under heaven, Parthians, Medes, </span>&c: so numerous were the Jews, and so widely dispersed through all the countries of the world. 4th, When Paul travelled through Asia and Europe, he found the Jews so numerous, that in all the noted cities of the Gentiles they had synagogues, in which they were assembled for the worship of God, and were joined by multitudes of proselytes from among the heathens. 5th, The same apostle, in his speech to Agrippa, affirmed that the <span class="ital">twelve tribes </span>were then existing, and that they <span class="ital">served God day and night, </span>in expectation of the promise made to the fathers, <a href="/acts/26-6.htm" title="And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, to our fathers:">Acts 26:6</a>. 6th, Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiq., 50. </span>14. c. 12) tells us, that in his time one region could not contain the Jews, but they dwelt in most of the flourishing cities of Asia and Europe, in the islands and continent, not much less in number than the heathen inhabitants. From all which it is evident that the Jews of the dispersion were more numerous than even the Jews in Judea; and that James very properly inscribed his letter <span class="ital">to the twelve tribes </span>which were in the dispersion, seeing the twelve tribes really existed then, and do still exist, although not distinguished by separate habitations, as they were anciently in their own land. <span class="ital">Greeting </span>— That is, wishing you all blessings, temporal, spiritual, and eternal.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>James, a servant of God - On the meaning of the word "servant" in this connection, see the note at <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>. Compare the note at Plm 1:16. It is remarkable that James does not call himself an apostle; but this does not prove that the writer of the Epistle was not an apostle, for the same omission occurs in the Epistle of John, and in the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, the Thessalonians, and to Philemon. It is remarkable, also, considering the relation which James is supposed to have borne to the Lord Jesus as his "brother" (<a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; Introduction, 1). That he did not refer to that as constituting a ground of claim to his right to address others; but this is only one instance out of many, in the New Testament, in which it is regarded as a higher honor to be the "servant of God," and to belong to his family, than to sustain any relations of blood or kindred. Compare <a href="/matthew/11-50.htm">Matthew 11:50</a>. It may be observed also (Compare the introduction, Section 1), that this term is one which was especially appropriate to James, as a man eminent for his integrity. His claim to respect and deference was not primarily founded on any relationship which he sustained; any honor of birth or blood; or even any external office, but on the fact that he was a "servant of God."<p>And of the Lord Jesus Christ - The "servant of the Lord Jesus," is an appellation which is often given to Christians, and particularly to the ministers of religion. They are his servants, not in the sense that they are slaves, but in the sense that they voluntarily obey his will, and labor for him, and not for themselves.<p>To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad - Greek "The twelve tribes which are in the dispersion," or of the dispersion (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;  en te&#772; diaspora). This word occurs only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>, and <a href="/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>. It refers properly to those who lived out of Palestine, or who were scattered among the Gentiles. There were two great "dispersions;" the Eastern and the Western. The first had its origin about the time when the ten tribes were carried away to Assyria, and in the time of the Babylonian captivity. In consequence of these events, and of the fact that large numbers of the Jews went to Babylon, and other Eastern countries, for purposes of travel, commerce, etc., there were many Jews in the East in the times of the apostles. The other was the Western "dispersion," which commenced about the time of Alexander the Great, and which was promoted by various causes, until there were large numbers of Jews in Egypt and along Northern Africa, in Asia Minor, in Greece proper, and even in Rome. To which of these classes this Epistle was directed is not known; but most probably the writer had particular reference to those in the East. See the introduction, Section 2. The phrase "the twelve tribes," was the common term by which the Jewish people were designated, and was in use long after the ten tribes were carried away, leaving, in fact, only two of the twelve in Palestine. Compare the notes at <a href="/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>. Many have supposed that James here addressed them as Jews, and that the Epistle was sent to them as such. But this opinion has no probability; because:<p>(1) If this had been the case, he would not have been likely to begin his Epistle by saying that he was "a servant of Jesus Christ," a name so odious to the Jews.<p>(2) and, if he had spoken of himself as a Christian, and had addressed his countrymen as himself a believer in Jesus as the Messiah, though regarding them as Jews, it is incredible that he did not make a more distinct reference to the principles of the Christian religion; that he used no arguments to convince them that Jesus was the Messiah; that he did not attempt to convert them to the Christian faith.<p>It should be added, that at first most converts were made from those who had been trained in the Jewish faith, and it is not improbable that one in Jerusalem, addressing those who were Christians out of Palestine, would naturally think of them as of Jewish origin, and would be likely to address them as appertaining to the "twelve tribes." The phrase "the twelve tribes" became also a sort of technical expression to denote the people of God - the church.<p>Greeting - A customary form of salutation, meaning, in Greek, to joy, to rejoice; and implying that he wished their welfare.

R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>This is called by Eusebius ([Ecclesiastical History, 2.23], about the year 330 A.D.) the first of the Catholic Epistles, that is, the Epistles intended for general circulation, as distinguished from Paul's Epistles, which were addressed to particular churches or individuals. In the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament extant, they stand before the Epistles of Paul. Of them, two only are mentioned by Eusebius as universally acknowledged (Homologoumena), namely, the First Epistle of Peter, and the First Epistle of John. All, however, are found in every existing manuscript of the whole New Testament.<p>It is not to be wondered at that Epistles not addressed to particular churches (and particularly one like that of James, addressed to the Israelite believers scattered abroad) should be for a time less known. The first mention of James' Epistle by name occurs early in the third century, in Origen [Commentary on John 1:19, 4.306], who was born about 185, and died A.D. 254. Clement of Rome ([First Epistle to the Corinthians, 10]; compare Jas 2:21, 23; [First Epistle to the Corinthians, 11]; compare Jas 2:25; Heb 11:31) quotes it. So also Hermas [Shepherd] quotes Jas 4:7. Iren&aelig;us [Against Heresies, 4.16.2] is thought to refer to Jas 2:23. Clement of Alexandria commented on it, according to Cassiodorus. Ephrem the Syrian [Against the Greeks, 3.51] quotes Jas 5:1. An especially strong proof of its authenticity is afforded by its forming part of the old Syriac version, which contains no other of the disputed books (Antilegomena, [Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.25]), except the Epistle to the Hebrews. None of the Latin fathers before the fourth century quote it; but soon after the Council of Nicea it was admitted as canonical both by the East and West churches, and specified as such in the Councils of Hippo and Carthage (397 A.D.). This is just what we might expect; a writing known only partially at first, when subsequently it obtained a wider circulation, and the proofs were better known of its having been recognized in apostolic churches, having in them men endowed with the discernment of spirits, which qualified them for discriminating between inspired and uninspired writings, was universally accepted. Though doubted for a time, at last the disputed books (James, Second Peter, Second and Third John, Jude, and Revelation) were universally and undoubtingly accepted, so that no argument for the Old Testament Apocrypha can be drawn from their case: as to it the Jewish Church had no doubt; it was known not to be inspired.<p>Luther's objection to it ("an Epistle of straw, and destitute of an evangelic character") was due to his mistaken idea that it (Jas 2:14-26) opposes the doctrine of justification by faith, and not by works, taught by Paul. But the two apostles, while looking at justification from distinct standpoints, perfectly harmonize and mutually complement the definitions of one another. Faith precedes love and the works of love; but without them it is dead. Paul regards faith in the justification of the sinner before God; James, in the justification of the believer evidently before men. The error which James meets was the Jewish notion that their possession and knowledge of the law of God would justify them, even though they disobeyed it (compare Jas 1:22 with Ro 2:17-25). Jas 1:3; 4:1, 12 seem plainly to allude to Ro 5:3; 6:13; 7:23; 14:4. Also the tenor of Jas 2:14-26 on "justification," seems to allude to Paul's teaching, so as to correct false Jewish notions of a different kind from those which he combatted, though not unnoticed by him also (Ro 2:17, &c.).<p>Paul (Ga 2:9) arranges the names "James, Cephas, John," in the order in which their Epistles stand. James who wrote this Epistle (according to most ancient writers) is called (Ga 1:19), "the Lord's brother." He was son of Alpheus or Cleopas (Lu 24:13-18) and Mary, sister of the Virgin Mary. Compare Mr 15:40 with Joh 19:25, which seems to identify the mother of James the Less with the wife of Cleopas, not with the Virgin Mary, Cleopas' wife's sister. Cleopas is the Hebrew, Alpheus the Greek mode of writing the same name. Many, however, as Hegesippus [Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 23.1], distinguish the Lord's brother from the son of Alpheus. But the Gospel according to the Hebrews, quoted by Jerome, represents James, the Lord's brother, as present at the institution of the Eucharist, and therefore identical with the apostle James. So the Apocryphal Gospel of James. In Acts, James who is put foremost in Jerusalem after the death of James, the son of Zebedee, is not distinguished from James, the son of Alpheus. He is not mentioned as one of the Lord's brethren in Ac 1:14; but as one of the "apostles" (Ga 1:19). He is called "the Less" (literally, "the little," Mr 15:40), to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. Alford considers James, the brother of the Lord, the author of the Epistle, to have been the eldest of the sons of Joseph and Mary, after Jesus (compare Mt 13:55), and that James the son of Alpheus is distinguished from him by the latter being called "the Less," (that is, junior). His arguments against the Lord's brother, the bishop of Jerusalem, being the apostle, are: (1) The Lord's brethren did not believe on Jesus at a time when the apostles had been already called (Joh 7:3, 5), therefore none of the Lord's brethren could be among the apostles (but it does not follow from Joh 7:3 that no one of them believed). (2) The apostles' commission was to preach the Gospel everywhere, not to be bishops in a particular locality (but it is unlikely that one not an apostle should be bishop of Jerusalem, to whom even apostles yield deference, Ac 15:13, 19; Ga 1:19; 2:9, 12. The Saviour's last command to the apostles collectively to preach the Gospel everywhere, is not inconsistent with each having a particular sphere of labor in which he should be a missionary bishop, as Peter is said to have been at Antioch).<p>He was surnamed "the Just." It needed peculiar wisdom so to preach the Gospel as not to disparage the law. As bishop of Jerusalem writing to the twelve tribes, he sets forth the Gospel in its aspect of relation to the law, which the Jews so reverenced. As Paul's Epistles are a commentary on the doctrines flowing from the death and resurrection of Christ, so James's Epistle has a close connection with His teaching during His life on earth, especially His Sermon on the Mount. In both, the law is represented as fulfilled in love: the very language is palpably similar (compare Jas 1:2 with Mt 5:12; Jas 1:4 with Mt 5:48; Jas 1:5; 5:15 with Mt 7:7-11; Jas 2:13 with Mt 5:7; 6:14, 15; Jas 2:10 with Mt 5:19; Jas 4:4 with Mt 6:24; Jas 4:11 with Mt 7:1, 2; Jas 5:2 with Mt 6:19). The whole spirit of this Epistle breathes the same Gospel-righteousness which the Sermon on the Mount inculcates as the highest realization of the law. James's own character as "the Just," or legally righteous, disposed him to this coincidence (compare Jas 1:20; 2:10; 3:18 with Mt 5:20). It also fitted him for presiding over a Church still zealous for the law (Ac 21:18-24; Ga 2:12). If any could win the Jews to the Gospel, he was most likely who presented a pattern of Old Testament righteousness, combined with evangelical faith (compare also Jas 2:8 with Mt 5:44, 48). Practice, not profession, is the test of obedience (compare Jas 2:17; 4:17 with Mt 7:2-23). Sins of the tongue, however lightly regarded by the world, are an offense against the law of love (compare Jas 1:26; 3:2-18 with Mt 5:22; also any swearing, Jas 5:12; compare Mt 5:33-37).<p>The absence of the apostolic benediction in this Epistle is probably due to its being addressed, not merely to the believing, but also indirectly to unbelieving, Israelites. To the former he commends humility, patience, and prayer; to the latter he addresses awful warnings (Jas 5:7-11; 4:9; 5:1-6).<p>James was martyred at the Passover. This Epistle was probably written just before it. The destruction of Jerusalem foretold in it (Jas 5:1, &c.), ensued a year after his martyrdom, A.D. 69. Hegesippus (quoted in Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 2.23]) narrates that he was set on a pinnacle of the temple by the scribes and Pharisees, who begged him to restrain the people who were in large numbers embracing Christianity. "Tell us," said they in the presence of the people gathered at the feast, "which is the door of Jesus?" James replied with a loud voice, "Why ask ye me concerning Jesus the Son of man? He sitteth at the right hand of power, and will come again on the clouds of heaven." Many thereupon cried, Hosanna to the Son of David. But James was cast down headlong by the Pharisees; and praying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," he was stoned and beaten to death with a fuller's club. The Jews, we know from Acts, were exasperated at Paul's rescue from their hands, and therefore determined to wreak their vengeance on James. The publication of his Epistle to the dispersed Israelites, to whom it was probably carried by those who came up to the periodical feasts, made him obnoxious to them, especially to the higher classes, because it foretold the woes soon about to fall on them and their country. Their taunting question, "Which is the door of Jesus?" (that is, by what door will He come when He returns?), alludes to his prophecy, "the coming of the Lord draweth nigh &#8230; behold the Judge standeth before the door" (Jas 5:8, 9). Heb 13:7 probably refers to the martyrdom of James, who had been so long bishop over the Jewish Christians at Jerusalem, "Remember them which have (rather, 'had') the rule (spiritually) over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation."<p>His inspiration as an apostle is expressly referred to in Ac 15:19, 28, "My sentence is," &c.: "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us," &c. His episcopal authority is implied in the deference paid to him by Peter and Paul (Ac 12:17; 21:18; Ga 1:19; 2:9). The Lord had appeared specially to him after the resurrection (1Co 15:7). Peter in his First Epistle (universally from the first received as canonical) tacitly confirms the inspiration of James's Epistle, by incorporating with his own inspired writings no less than ten passages from James. The "apostle of the circumcision," Peter, and the first bishop of Jerusalem, would naturally have much in common. Compare Jas 1:1 with 1Pe 1:1; Jas 1:2 with 1Pe 1:6; 4:12, 13; Jas 1:11 with 1Pe 1:24; Jas 1:18 with 1Pe 1:3; Jas 2:7 with 1Pe 4:14; Jas 3:13 with 1Pe 2:12; Jas 4:1 with 1Pe 2:11; Jas 4:6 with 1Pe 5:5, 6; Jas 4:7 with 1Pe 5:6, 9; Jas 4:10 with 1Pe 5:6; Jas 5:20 with 1Pe 4:6. Its being written in the purest Greek shows it was intended not only for the Jews at Jerusalem, but also for the Hellenistic, that is, Greek-speaking, Jews.<p>The style is close, curt, and sententious, gnome following after gnome. A Hebraic character pervades the Epistle, as appears in the occasional poetic parallelisms (Jas 3:1-12). Compare "assembly": Greek, "synagogue," Jas 2:2, Margin. The images are analogical arguments, combining at once logic and poetry. Eloquence and persuasiveness are prominent characteristics.<p>The similarity to Matthew, the most Hebrew of the Gospels, is just what we might expect from the bishop of Jerusalem writing to Israelites. In it the higher spirit of Christianity is seen putting the Jewish law in its proper place. The law is enforced in its everlasting spirit, not in the letter for which the Jews were so zealous. The doctrines of grace, the distinguishing features of Paul's teaching to the Hellenists and Gentiles, are less prominent as being already taught by that apostle. James complements Paul's teaching, and shows to the Jewish Christians who still kept the legal ordinances down to the fall of Jerusalem, the spiritual principle of the law, namely, love manifested in obedience. To sketch "the perfect man" continuing in the Gospel law of liberty, is his theme.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Jas 1:1-27. Inscription: Exhortation on Hearing, Speaking, and Wrath.<p>The last subject is discussed in Jas 3:13-4:17.<p>1. James&#8212;an apostle of the circumcision, with Peter and John, James in Jerusalem, Palestine, and Syria; Peter in Babylon and the East; John in Ephesus and Asia Minor. Peter addresses the dispersed Jews of Pontus, Galatia, and Cappadocia; James, the Israelites of the twelve tribes scattered abroad.<p>servant of God&#8212;not that he was not an apostle; for Paul, an apostle, also calls himself so; but as addressing the Israelites generally, including even indirectly the unbelieving, he in humility omits the title "apostle"; so Paul in writing to the Hebrews; similarly Jude, an apostle, in his General Epistle.<p>Jesus Christ&#8212;not mentioned again save in Jas 2:1; not at all in his speeches (Ac 15:14, 15; 21:20, 21), lest his introducing the name of Jesus oftener should seem to arise from vanity, as being "the Lord's brother" [Bengel]. His teaching being practical, rather than doctrinal, required less frequent mention of Christ's name.<p>scattered abroad&#8212;literally "which are in the dispersion." The dispersion of the Israelites, and their connection with Jerusalem as a center of religion, was a divinely ordered means of propagating Christianity. The pilgrim troops of the law became caravans of the Gospel [Wordsworth].<span class="bld">Jam 1:1</span> The apostle's address to the dispersed Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:2-4</span> He recommendeth patience and joy in afflictions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:5-8</span> and prayer with faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:9-11</span> He giveth advice to the poor and to the rich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:12</span> The reward of those that are proof under trial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:13-16</span> Our own lusts, and not God, tempt us to sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:17,18</span> God is the unchangeable author of all good to his creatures.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:19-25</span> We must receive the word with purity and meekness, and not<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>only hear, but do it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:26</span> The necessity of governing the tongue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jam 1:27</span> The essential duties of true religion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">James, </span> the son of Alpheus and brother of Jude, called likewise <span class="ital">the brother of the Lord, </span><span class="bld"> Gal 1:19</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A servant; </span> not only by creation, as all the creatures are, <span class="bld">Psa 119:91</span>, or by redemption, as all believers are, but by special commission in the office of an apostle; see <span class="bld">Gal 1:10 Phi 1:1 2Pe 1:1</span>; compare likewise <span class="bld">Rom 1:9</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ:</span> the members of this clause may be taken, either jointly, and then the conjunction <span class="ital">and</span> hath the power only of an explication, q.d.

That is, of God the Father; not by creation only, as every man is; nor merely by calling grace, as is every regenerate person; but by office, as a preacher of the Gospel, being one that served God in the Gospel of his Son, and was an apostle of Christ; nor is this any sufficient objection to his being one, since others of the apostles so style themselves: <p>and of the Lord Jesus Christ; the Ethiopic version reads this in connection with the former clause, without the copulative "and", "James, the servant of God, our Lord Jesus Christ": and so some consider the copulative as explanative of who is meant by God, even the Lord Jesus Christ: but it seems best to understand them as distinct; and that this apostle was not only the servant of God the Father, but of his Son Jesus Christ, and that in the same sense, referring to his office as an apostle of Christ, and minister of the word: <p>to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad; by whom are meant believing Jews, who were of the several tribes of Israel, and which were in number "twelve", according to the number and names of the twelve patriarchs, the sons of Jacob; and these were not the Christian Jews, who were scattered abroad upon the persecution raised at the death of Stephen, <a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a> but they were the posterity of those who had been dispersed in former captivities, by the Assyrians and others, and who remained in the several countries whither they were carried, and never returned. The Jews say (f), that the ten tribes will never return, and that they will have no part nor portion in the world to come; but these the Gospel met with in their dispersion, and by it they were effectually called and converted, and are the same that Peter writes to, <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>. And thus we read of an hundred and forty and four thousand sealed of all the tribes of Israel, <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a> and to these the apostle here sends greeting; that is, his Christian salutation, wishing them all happiness and prosperity, in soul and body, for time and eternity; and it includes all that grace, mercy, and peace, mentioned in the usual forms of salutation by the other apostles. The same form is used in <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a> and since it was James that gave the advice there, which the rest of the apostles and elders came into, it is highly probable that the epistles sent to the Gentiles were dictated by him; and the likeness of the form of salutation may confirm his being the writer of this epistle. <p>(f) T.

Some noted Jewish Rabbis of this name lived in the earliest centuries of Christianity, notably Jacob ben Ḳorshai, a “Tanna” (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “teacher” of the Oral Law) of the second century. The English form of the name comes from the Italian Giacomo. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: Only <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου</span> here can refer to Christ; in <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a> the differentiation is made still more complete … <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ καὶ θεοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>.

But the disjunctive use of <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> in the words before us does not imply a withholding of the divine title from our Lord, for the usage of <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span> in the N.T., especially without the article, when connected with <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>, is in favour of its being regarded as a divine title, see <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,...">1 Corinthians 1:1-3</a>, etc. Hellenistic Jews used <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span> as a name for God; the non-use of the article gains in significance when it is remembered that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύριος</span>, “Dominus,” was a title given to the early Roman Emperors in order to express their deity, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/25-26.htm" title="Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Why I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.">Acts 25:26</a>, where Festus refers to Nero as <span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύριος</span>. The Palestinian Syriac Lectionary (containing, as generally conceded, the dialect which our Lord spoke), as well as the Peshittâ, read “Our Lord,” the expression used in the Peshiṭta in <a href="/matthew/8-25.htm" title="And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.">Matthew 8:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριε</span>, <span class="greekheb">σῶσον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπολλύμεθα</span>, and in <a href="/matthew/20-33.htm" title="They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.">Matthew 20:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀνοιγνῶσιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν</span>; both instances of divine power being exercised. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>: the use of this title, applied to Jesus without further comment, speaks against an early date for the Epistle; in a letter written to <span class="ital">Jews</span> during the apostolic age it is inconceivable that the Messiah should be referred to in this connection without some justification; Jewish beliefs concerning the Messiah were such as to make it impossible for them to accept Jesus as the Messiah without some teaching on the subject; this would be the more required in the case of Jews of the Dispersion who could not have had the same opportunities of learning the truths of Christianity as Palestinian Jews. The way in which the title is here applied to our Lord implies that the truth taught was already generally accepted. The absence of the article also points to a late date. <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span>: Generally speaking, to the Jew <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span> (<span class="greekheb">עֶבֶד</span>), when used in reference to God, meant a <span class="ital">worshipper</span>, and when used with reference to men a <span class="ital">slave</span>; as the latter sense is out of the question here, <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span> must be understood as meaning worshipper, in which case the deity of our Lord would appear to be distinctly implied. <span class="greekheb">ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ</span>: the “twelve tribes” was merely a synonym for the Jewish race (<span class="greekheb">ἔθνος Ἰουδαίων</span>), but there was a real distinction between the Jews of the Dispersion and the Palestinian Jews. The latter were for the most part peasants or artisans, while the former, congregated almost wholly in cities, were practically all traders (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">Jam 4:13</a>). In each case there was a restricted circle of the learned. The connection of the Diaspora-Jews with Palestine became less and less close, until at last it consisted of little more than the payment of the annual Temple dues; with very many one visit in a lifetime to Jerusalem sufficed, and this was of course entirely discontinued after the Destruction, when the head-quarters of Jewry became centred in the Rabbinical academy of Jabne. From the present point of view, it is very important to bear in mind, above all, two points of difference between Palestinian and Diaspora-Jews, (1) Language, (2) Religion. (1) Among the former, Aramaic had displaced Hebrew; Aramaic was the language of everyday life, as well as of religion (hence the need of the Methurgeman to translate the Hebrew Scriptures in the Synagogues); among the latter Greek was spoken. It is not necessary to insist upon the obvious fact that this difference of language brought with it a corresponding difference of mental atmosphere; the Jew remained a Jew, but his way of thinking became modified. (2) Their contact with other peoples brought to the Diaspora-Jews a larger outlook upon the world; at the same time, they could not fail to see the immeasurable superiority of their faith over the heathen cults practised by others. This resulted on their laying greater stress on the essentials of their faith; the ethical side of their religion received greater emphasis, the spirituality of belief became more realised, and it therefore followed of necessity that universalistic ideas grew, so that proselytism became, at one time, a great characteristic among the Diaspora-Jews; Judaism contained a message to all peoples, it was felt; and thus the particularistic character of Palestinian Judaism found no place among the Diaspora-Jews. But, at the same time, the Bible of these Jews, which exercised an immense influence upon their thought and literature, was Hebraic in essence though clothed in Greek garb; hence that extraordinarily interesting phenomenon, the Hellenistic Jew. In view of what has been said it is interesting to note that two outstanding characteristics of the Epistle before us are: Hebraic thought and diction expressed in Greek form, and the emphasis laid on ethics rather than on doctrine. The meaning of <span class="greekheb">διασπορά</span> is quite unambiguous, and there is no justification for restricting it to the Eastern Dispersion; it includes the Jews of Italy, Macedonia, Greece, Asia Minor and, above all, Egypt, as well as of Asia. For further details see <a href="/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>; <a href="/esther/8-9.htm" title="Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.">Esther 8:9</a>; <a href="/esther/9-30.htm" title="And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,">Esther 9:30</a>; <a href="/esther/10-1.htm" title="And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the isles of the sea.">Esther 10:1</a>; <a href="/context/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,...">Acts 2:9-11</a>; <span class="ital">Syb.

It is of interest to note that in the Epistle inspired by St. James (<a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>) this form of salutation is used; it would, however, be precarious to draw deductions as to authorship from this, for the use of the infinitive for the imperative is quite common in Hellenistic Greek; as Moulton says: “We have every reason to expect it in the N.T., and its rarity there is the only matter of surprise” (<span class="ital">Ibid</span>.).

Trials and their Purpose<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ</span>] The description which the writer gives of himself throws no light on his identity. The term “servant,” better <span class="bld">slave</span>, as one who had been bought with a price (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>), was used of themselves by both St Peter (<a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a>) and St Paul (<a href="/romans/1-15.htm" title="So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.">Romans 1:15</a> <a href="/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>). It might be claimed by either of the Apostles who bore the name of James, or by the brother of our Lord, or indeed by any believer. (<a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1 Peter 2:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be noted that this and ch. <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a> are the only passages in which St James names our Lord, and that the form in which the Name appears is identical with that in the Epistle from the Apostles and Elders assembled under St James’s presidency, in <a href="/acts/15-26.htm" title="Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Acts 15:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">that are in the dispersion</span>. The superscription is interesting as shewing that the ten tribes of the Kingdom of Israel, though they had been carried into a more distant exile than Judah and Benjamin, were thought of, not as lost and out of sight, but as still sharing the faith and hope of their fathers. So St Paul speaks of “the twelve-tribed nation” as “serving God day and night” (<a href="/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>), and our Lord’s promise that His twelve disciples should sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>), and the Apocalyptic vision of the sealing of the tribes (<a href="/context/revelation/7-5.htm" title="Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand....">Revelation 7:5-8</a>) imply the same belief. The legend as to the disappearance of the Ten Tribes, which has given rise to so many insane dreams as to their identification with the Red Indians of America or our Anglo-Saxon forefathers, appears for the first time in the Apocryphal 2 Esdras (13:39–47), a book probably of about the same date as the Revelation of St John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The term, “the dispersion,” the abstract noun being used for the concrete, had come to be a technical term for the Hellenistic and other Jews who were to be found within, or beyond, the limits of the Roman Empire. So the Jews ask whether our Lord will go “to the <span class="ital">dispersion</span> of (i. e. among) the Greeks” (<a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>). So St Peter writes to “the sojourners of the <span class="ital">dispersion</span>” in the provinces of Asia Minor (<a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a>). The term had probably come into use from the LXX. of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm" title="The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> (“There shall be a <span class="ital">dispersion</span> in all the kingdoms of the world”). So in <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/5-19.htm" title="But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate.">Jdt 5:19</a>, Judah and Benjamin are said “to have come back from the <span class="ital">dispersion</span>,” and the prayer of Nehemiah in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-27.htm" title="Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.">2Ma 1:27</a> is that “God would gather together his <span class="ital">dispersion</span>,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">greeting</span>] The salutation is the same as in the Epistle purporting to come from the Church over which St James presided, in <a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>. The literal meaning of the word is to rejoice, and the idiomatic use of the infinitive is a condensed expression of the full “I wish you joy.” It was primarily a formula of Greek letter-writers, but it had been used by the LXX. for the Hebrew “peace” in <a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm" title="There is no peace, said the LORD, to the wicked.">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm" title="There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked.">Isaiah 57:21</a>, and appears in the superscription of the letters of Antiochus in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-19.htm" title="Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizens wisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:">2Ma 9:19</a>. It is the word used in the mock salutations of the soldiers in the history of the Passion, “<span class="ital">Hail</span>, King of the Jews” (<a href="/matthew/26-49.htm" title="And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.">Matthew 26:49</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-29.htm" title="And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-9.htm" title="And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.

For in many particulars the Epistle of James corresponds with the Epistle to the Hebrews, and also with the First Epistle of Peter. We will point out the agreement at the passages in question. Oft-times have prophets and apostles, apart from each other, used the same sentiments and expressions, to confirm the minds of their hearers.[1]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] St James makes frequent use of the figure Anadiplosis, which properly signifies the use of the same word at the end of one sentence and at the beginning of the next.

It was divided into three great sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Babylonian</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the original dispersion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Syrian</span>, dating from the Greek conquests in Asia, Seleucus Nicator having transplanted largo bodies of Jews from Babylonia to the capitals of his Western provinces; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">Egyptian</span>, the Jewish settlements in Alexandria, established by Alexander and Ptolemy I., and thence spreading along the north coast of Africa. To these we should, perhaps, add a fourth - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">Roman</span>, consequent upon the occupation of Jerusalem by Pompey,  <span class="date">B.C. 63</span>. All these four divisions were represented in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (see <a href="/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8-11</a>) - a fact which will help to account for St. James's letter. The whole expression, "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad," makes it perfectly clear that St. James is writing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Jews, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to those beyond the borders of Palestine. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Jesus Christ<p>Only here and in <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>; nowhere in the speeches of James (<a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, <a href="/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15</a>; <a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a> sq.). Had he used Jesus' name it might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord's brother. In all the addresses of epistles the full name, Jesus Christ, is given.<p>Servant (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Properly, hired servant. Compare <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; Jde 1:1.<p>That are scattered abroad (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;)<p>Lit., in the dispersion; on which see on <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>. Rev., which are of the dispersion.<p>Greeting (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting: joy be with you. Compare the same expression in the letter from the church at Jerusalem, <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>; one of the very few peculiarities of style which connect this epistle with the James of the Acts. It does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic Epistles. </body></html>
