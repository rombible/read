Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A double minded man - The word here used, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  dipsuchos occurs only here and in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>. It means, properly, one who has two souls; then one who is wavering or inconstant. It is applicable to a man who has no settled principles; who is controlled by passion; who is influenced by popular feeling; who is now inclined to one opinion or course of conduct, and now to another.<p>Is unstable in all his ways - That is, not merely in regard to prayer, the point particularly under discussion, but in respect to everything. From the instability which the wavering must evince in regard to prayer, the apostle takes occasion to make the general remark concerning such a man, that stability and firmness could be expected on no subject. The hesitancy which manifested on that one subject would extend to all; and we might expect to find such a man irresolute and undetermined in all things. This is always true. If we find a man who takes hold of the promises of God with firmness; who feels the deepest assurance when he prays that God will hear prayer; who always goes to him without hesitation in his perplexities and trials, never wavering, we shall find one who is firm in his principles, steady in his integrity, settled in his determinations, and steadfast in his plans of life - a man whose character we shall feel that we understand, and in whom we can confide. Such a man eminently was Luther; and the spirit which is thus evinced by taking firmly hold of the promises of God is the best kind of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. double-minded&#8212;literally, "double-souled," the one soul directed towards God, the other to something else. The Greek favors Alford's translation, "He (the waverer, Jas 1:6) is a man double-minded, unstable," &c.; or better, Beza's. The words in this Jas 1:8 are in apposition with "that man," Jas 1:7; thus the "us," which is not in the original, will not need to be supplied, "A man double-minded, unstable in all his ways!" The word for "double-minded" is found here and in Jas 4:8, for the first time in Greek literature. It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle, "wavering" man, as the context shows. It is opposed to the single eye (Mt 6:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A double minded man; </span> either; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Many expositors consider <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ δίψυχος</span> as the subject and <span class="greekheb">ἀκατάστατος</span> the predicate, wanting the copula (Luther: “a doubter is unstable;” so Calvin, Schneckenburger, de Wette, Lange, and others); but according to this construction the idea <span class="greekheb">δίψυχος</span> falls too much into the background, and also the train of thought would be too unconnected. It is better to take both <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ δίψυχος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀκατάστατος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as in apposition to <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος</span>.

Less stress is to be put on the want of the article (Schneckenburger, de Wette), as it would be here hardly suitable. Correctly Winer, p. 497 [E. T. 670]: “he, a double-minded man;” so also Wiesinger, Brückner, Bouman, and others. Only according to this construction is the full meaning given to the idea <span class="greekheb">δίψυχος</span>. The word is not to be taken merely as another expression for <span class="greekheb">διακρινόμενος</span> (Luther, Beza, Grotius, Cremer, and others; Luther directly renders it “a doubter”), but it characterizes the inward nature of the doubter. According to the mode in which <span class="greekheb">δισώματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">δικάρδιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">δίγλωσσος</span>, and similar words are formed, <span class="greekheb">δίψυχος</span> (which occurs neither in the classics nor in the LXX. and the Apocrypha, but besides here only in chap. <a href="/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">Jam 4:8</a>, and the Church Fathers) properly denotes <span class="ital">having two souls</span>; it thus describes the doubter as a man who has, as it were, two souls contending against each other: one of which is turned to God, and one of which is turned away from God (thus to the world); who, accordingly, will be at the same time <span class="greekheb">φίλος τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">φίλος τοῦ κόσμου</span>, although <span class="greekheb">φιλία τοῦ κόσμου</span> is <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (chap. <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace.

In the verse before us the word seems to mean unreliability, the man who does not trust God cannot be trusted by men; this probably is what must have been in the mind of the writer.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσαις</span>, etc.: a Hebrew expression for the course of a man’s life in the sense of his “manner of life” (<span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφή</span>, see <a href="/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">Jam 3:13</a>) see <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm" title="My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:">Proverbs 3:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσαις ὁδοῖς σου γνώριζε αὐτήν</span> (Hebrew <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>), <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ὀρθοτομῇ τὰς ὁδούς σου</span>. The sense of the expression is certainly different from <span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὐτοῦ</span> in <a href="/james/1-11.htm" title="For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.">Jam 1:11</a> which refers to the days of a man’s life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">A double minded man</span> …] The context shews that the man so described (the Greek word is not found in any earlier writer and may have been coined by St James) is not the fraudulent man but the waverer, trying to serve two masters (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>), halting between two opinions (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm" title="And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.">1 Kings 18:21</a>). It answers to the “<span class="ital">double heart</span>” (Heb. “<span class="ital">a heart and a heart</span>”) of <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm" title="They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.">Psalm 12:2</a>. In <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-28.htm" title="Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart.">Sir 1:28</a> we find the same thought, though not the same word, “Come not unto the Lord <span class="ital">with a double heart</span>,” and again in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/2-12.htm" title="Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!">Sir 2:12</a>, where a woe is uttered against the “sinner <span class="ital">that goeth two ways</span>,” in company with “the fearful and faint-hearted.” Clement of Rome (i. 11) reproduces St James’s word. The construction of the sentence is doubtful, and may be taken either as in the English text, or, with “he that doubteth” as the subject and “double-minded, unstable” as predicates.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unstable</span>] The Greek word is found in the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm" title="O you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with fair colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.">Isaiah 54:11</a>, where the English version has “tossed with tempest.” It is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, except as a various reading in ch. <a href="/james/3-8.htm" title="But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.">James 3:8</a>, but the corresponding noun is often used both literally and figuratively (<a href="/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm" title="For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="/james/3-16.htm" title="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.">James 3:16</a> and the LXX. of <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm" title="A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth works ruin.">Proverbs 26:28</a>). There is a slight change of imagery, and the picture brought before us is that of a man who does not walk straight onward, but in “all his ways” goes to and fro, now on this side, now on that, staggering, like a drunken man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">Jam 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνὴρ δίψυχος</span>, <span class="ital">a double-minded man</span>) The same word (<span class="greekheb">δίψυχος</span>) is applied, ch. <a href="/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">Jam 4:8</a>, to those who have not a heart pure and <span class="ital">simply</span> given up to God. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, or in the Septuagint. It may be translated “<span class="ital">having two souls</span>,” as we speak of “a <span class="ital">double-tongued</span>”[7] man. Hesychius, <span class="greekheb">διψυχία ἀπορία</span>, “<span class="ital">a state of doubt</span> or <span class="ital">perplexity</span>. It is therefore connected in meaning with the word <span class="greekheb">οιακρινόμενος</span>, “the wavering.” Such a man has, as it were, two souls, of which the one holds one opinion, the other holds another. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/2-12.htm" title="Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!">Sir 2:12</a>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΑῚ ΚΑΡΔΊΑΙς ΔΕΙΛΑῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΧΕΡΣῚ ΠΑΡΕΙΜΈΝΑΙς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ἉΜΑΡΤΩΛῷ ἘΠΙΒΑΊΝΟΝΤΙ ἘΠῚ ΔΎΟ ΤΡΊΒΟΥς</span></span></span>: “<span class="ital">Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!</span>”—<span class="greekheb">ἀκατάστατος</span>, <span class="ital">unstable</span>) For he does not obtain Divine direction by prayer: and being destitute of <span class="ital">wisdom</span>, he is at variance with himself and with others.
