The image well depicts the repellent subject. The small beginning, from some vain delight or worldly lust and pleasure; next from the vile embrace, as of an harlot—sin, growing in all its rank luxuriance, until it bear and engender, horribly, of itself, its deadly child. The word of parturition is frightful in the sense it would convey, as of some monstrous deformity, a hideous progeny ten-fold more cursed than its begetter.<p>The one effect of sin, more especially that of the flesh here alluded to, must be Death. The act itself is mortiferous, the result inevitable; just as much so, and as naturally, as the work of poison on the body. There are antidotes for both, but they must be given in time; the door of mercy stands not always open, nor will the “fountain opened . . . for sin and uncleanness” (<a href="/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>) flow on for ever. “Because,” says the Wisdom of God (<a href="/context/proverbs/1-24.htm" title="Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;">Proverbs 1:24-26</a>), “I have called, and ye refused . . . I also will laugh at your calamity.” “The wages of sin is death” (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a>), and their paymaster is the devil.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then when lust hath conceived - Compare <a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>. The allusion here is obvious. The meaning is, when the desire which we have naturally is quickened, or made to act, the result is that sin is produced. As our desires of good lie in the mind by nature, as our propensities exist as they were created, they cannot be regarded as sin, or treated as such; but when they are indulged, when plans of gratification are formed, when they are developed in actual life, the effect is sin. In the mere desire of good, of happiness, of food, of raiment, there is no sin; it becomes sin when indulged in an improper manner, and when it leads us to seek that which is forbidden - to invade the rights of others, or in any way to violate the laws of God. The Rabbis have a metaphor which strongly expresses the general sense of this passage" - "Evil concupiscence is at the beginning like the thread of a spider's web; afterwards it is like a cart rope." Sanhedrin, fol. 99.<p>It bringeth forth sin - The result is sin - open, actual sin. When that which is conceived in the heart is matured, it is seen to be sin. The design of all this is to show that sin is not to be traced to God, but to man himself; and in order to this, the apostle says that there is enough in the heart of man to account for all actual sin, without supposing that it is caused by God. The solution which he gives is, that there are certain propensities in man which, when they are suffered to act themselves out, will account for all the sin in the world. In regard to those native propensities themselves, he does not say whether he regards them as sinful and blameworthy or not; and the probability is, that he did not design to enter into a formal examination, or to make a formal statement, of the nature of these propensities themselves. He looked at man as he is as a creature of God - as endowed with certain animal propensities - as seen, in fact, to have strong passions by nature; and he showed that there was enough in him to account for the existence of sin, without bringing in the agency of God, or charging it on him.<p>In reference to those propensities, it may be observed that there are two kinds, either of which may account for the existence of sin, but which are frequently both combined. There are, first, our natural propensities; those which we have as men, as endowed with an animal nature, as having constitutional desires to be gratified, and wants to be supplied. Such Adam had in innocence; such the Saviour had; and such are to be regarded as in no respect in themselves sinful and wrong. Yet they may, in our case, as they did in Adam, lead us to sin, because, under their strong influence, we may be led to desire that which is forbidden, or which belongs to another. But there are, secondly, the propensities and inclinations which we have as the result of the fall, and which are evil in their nature and tendency; which as a matter of course, and especially when combined with the former, lead to open transgression. It is not always easy to separate these, and in fact they are often combined in producing the actual guilt of the world. It often requires a close analysis of a man's own mind to detect these different ingredients in his conduct, and the one often gets the credit of the other. The apostle James seems to have looked at it as a simple matter of fact, with a common sense view, by saying that there were "desires" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  epithumias) in a man's own mind which would account for all the actual sin in the world, without charging it on God. Of the truth of this, no one can entertain a doubt. - (See the supplementary note above at <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>.)<p>And sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death - The result of sin when it is fully carried out, is death - death in all forms. The idea is, that death, in whatever form it exists, is to be traced to sin, and that sin will naturally and regularly produce it. There is a strong similarity between this declaration and that of the apostle Paul <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21-23</a>; and it is probable that James had that passage in his mind. See the sentiment illustrated in the notes at that passage, and <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> note. Any one who indulges in a sinful thought or corrupt desire, should reflect that it may end in death - death temporal and eternal. Its natural tendency will be to produce such a death. This reflection should induce us to check an evil thought or desire at the beginning. Not for one moment should we indulge in it, for soon it may secure the mastery and be beyond our control; and the end may be seen in the grave, and the awful world of woe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress. "Lust," the harlot, then, "brings forth sin," namely, of that kind to which the temptation inclines. Then the particular sin (so the Greek implies), "when it is completed, brings forth death," with which it was all along pregnant [Alford]. This "death" stands in striking contrast to the "crown of life" (Jas 1:12) which "patience" or endurance ends in, when it has its "perfect work" (Jas 1:4). He who will fight Satan with Satan's own weapons, must not wonder if he finds himself overmatched.

A proposal of pleasure or profit being made, agreeable to lust, or the principle of corrupt nature, sinful man is pleased with it; and instead of resisting and rejecting the motion made, he admits of it, and receives it, and cherishes it in his mind; he dallies and plays with it; he dwells upon it in his thoughts, and hides it under his tongue, and in his heart, as a sweet morsel, and forsakes it not, but contrives ways and means how to bring it about; and this is lust's conceiving. The figure is used in <a href="/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a> on which Kimchi, a Jewish commentator, has this note; <p>"he (the psalmist) compares the thoughts of the heart  "to a conception", and when they go out in word, this is "travail", and in work or act, this is "bringing forth".'' <p>And so it follows here, <p>it bringeth forth sin; into act, not only by consenting to it, but by performing it: <p>and sin, when it is finished: being solicited, is agreed to, and actually committed: <p>bringeth forth death; as the first sin of man brought death into the world, brought a spiritual death, or moral death upon man, subjected him to a corporeal death, and made him liable to an eternal one; so every sin is deserving of death, death is the just wages of it; yea, even the motions of sin work in men to bring forth fruit unto death. Something like these several gradual steps, in which sin proceeds, is observed by the Jews, and expressed in much the like language, in allegorizing the case of Lot, and his two daughters (i); <p>"the concupiscent soul (or "lust") stirs up the evil figment, and imagines by it, and it cleaves to every evil imagination,  "until it conceives a little", and produces in the heart of man the evil thought, and cleaves to it; and as yet it is in his heart, and is not "finished" to do it, until this desire or lust stirs up the strength of the body, first to cleave to the evil figment, and then , "sin is finished"; as it is said, <a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36</a>.'' <p>(i) Midrash Haneelam in Zohar in Gen. fol. 67. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/james/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth <span class="cverse3">{n) sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</span><p>(n) By sin, in this place, he means actual sin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/james/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">Jam 1:15</a>.

By <span class="greekheb">εἶτα</span> the <span class="ital">result</span> of <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span>, namely <span class="greekheb">τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν</span>, is indicated as directly following upon it; <span class="greekheb">συλλαβοῦσα</span> forms the transition to it, which occurs by <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> taking the will of man captive; it, as it were, becomes pregnant, so that it bears sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει</span>] corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד</span>, which is uniformly in the LXX. translated by <span class="greekheb">συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκε</span> (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm" title="But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.">Genesis 4:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/4-17.htm" title="And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.">Genesis 4:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-17.htm" title="And God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.">Genesis 30:17</a>, and other passages). By <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> without the article, the fruit of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>, according to its quality, is indicated in an entirely general manner. Sin born by lust again carries in itself its own fruit (<span class="greekheb">κύημα</span>), which, having come to completion, (<span class="greekheb">ἀποτελεσθεῖσα</span>), is brought forth out of itself (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκύει</span>). According to de Wette, by <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> in the first clause is to be understood “the resolution or internal act,” but in the second clause (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα</span>), “sin accomplished in the external act,” thus acts of sin. This, however, is incorrect, as—(1) by <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> already mentioned is again taken up, and therefore must have the same meaning; and (2) <span class="greekheb">ἀποτελεῖν ἁμαρτίαν</span> cannot mean “sin accomplished.”[74] Wiesinger, with regard to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊΚΤΕΙ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑΝ</span></span></span>, correctly observes: “<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span> is sin, but whether the internal or external act is not stated;” yet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΘΕῖΣΑ</span></span></span> added in the following clause shows that James considered <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span> as something gradually developed, for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊΚΤΕΙΝ</span></span></span> (so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΘΕῖΣΑ</span></span></span> would be = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΧΘΕῖΣΑ</span></span></span>, Baumgarten: “sin brought or produced into the world in such a manner”), but <span class="ital">completed:</span> thus <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἁμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποτ</span>.=“<span class="ital">sin which has attained to its complete development.</span>” It is not entirely corresponding to the idea of James when Calvin (with whom most recent critics<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Kern, Schneckenburger, Theile, Wiesinger, and others—agree) explains it as “the entire sinful life” (non unum aliquod opus perpetratum, sed cursus peccandi completus; vita impia et scelerata). As James considers <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> itself personified, it is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΘΕῖΣΑ</span></span></span> when it has grown to such fulness of power that it rules man’s whole life. According to this idea, it is indeed correct when several interpreters explain <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛ</span></span></span>. by adulta; thus Bouman: peccatum, quum ad adultam pervenit aetatem; yet, linguistically, this explanation is not to be justified, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> is not equivalent to adolescere. The explanation given in the earlier edition of this commentary, that by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span> is meant the <span class="ital">act</span> of sin, is erroneous, because such a limitation of the general idea is not indicated; on this account it is not correct to think on <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span> as a single definite lust and sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brückner considers the addition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΘΕῖΣΑ</span></span></span> is made only “in order that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span>, which was at first represented as a child, might again be <span class="ital">represented</span> as a mother.” This, however, is incorrect; the origin and growth (or, more correctly, the completion) of sin by no means occur “in reality together at one moment;” sin bears death, which it carried in itself at the first, only when it is not interrupted in its development by a higher life-power, but has attained to its complete form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span>, by which James indicates the fruit of <span class="ital">completed</span> sin according to its nature, is to be understood, not only <span class="ital">temporary</span> death (Pott: homines peccando mortales factos esse omnes consentiunt N. T. scriptores), but, as the opposite of the <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> which God has promised, and will give to them who love Him, <span class="ital">eternal</span> death; see <a href="/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a> : <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὀψώνια τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span>· <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ χάρισμα Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span>.

When Wiesinger, against the explanation of de Wette, says that <span class="greekheb">συλλαβοῦσα</span> indicates that “the will consents to the demand of the desire, which is the resolution or internal act,” it is, on the contrary, to be observed that these two are by no means identical, as the resolution is an act of the will, and thus is actually sin, whilst by <span class="greekheb">συλλαβοῦσα</span> is indicated a point preceding <span class="greekheb">τίκτειν ἁμαρτιαν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">Jam 1:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἶτα</span>: continuing the description of the method of the working of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν</span>: With this idea of personification, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/zechariah/5-5.htm" title="Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth....">Zechariah 5:5-11</a>, where the woman “sitting in the midst of the ephah” is the personification of Wickedness; and for the metaphor see <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm" title="He made a pit, and dig it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.">Psalm 7:15</a> (Sept.), <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ ὠδίνησεν ἀνομίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">συνέλαβεν πόνον καὶ ἔτεκεν ἀδικίαν</span>.

In seeking to realise what the writer meant by death here one recalls, in the first place, such passages as <a href="/romans/5-21.htm" title="That as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 5:21</a> : <span class="ital">As sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord; cf</span>. <a href="/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a>, <a href="/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a> : <span class="ital">He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgement, but hath passed out of death into life; cf</span>. <a href="/context/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death....">John 8:51-52</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers.

But there is another set of passages in which death is used in its literal sense; these should be noted, for it is possible that they may throw light on the use of <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span> in the verse before us:—<a href="/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>, <span class="ital">Verily I say unto you, there be some of them that stand here, which shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom</span>, almost the identical words occur in <a href="/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="/luke/9-27.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:27</a>; the belief in the near advent of Christ witnessed to by such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>, etc., shows that the possibility of not dying, in the literal sense of the word, was entertained; for those who were living would know that when Christ, who had overcome death, should be among them again, there could be no question of death. The belief in the abolition of death when the Messiah should come was held by Jews as well as by Christians, see <span class="ital">e.g., Bereshith Rabba</span>, chap. 26, <span class="ital">Wajjiḳra Rabba</span>, chap. 30. The possibility may therefore be entertained that the writer of this Epistle is contemplating death in its literal sense, which those Christians will not escape in whom <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> holds sway, but which they are able to escape if they remain faithful until the return of Christ; that this is expected in the near future is clear from <a href="/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">Jam 5:7</a>, <span class="ital">Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord … stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is at hand</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ πλανᾶσθε</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, as regards the false teaching concerning the cause of sin in their hearts. The affectionate ending, “My beloved brethren” witnesses to the earnestness of the writer’s feelings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin</span>] The image suggested in the previous verse is developed with an almost startling boldness. The will that yields to desire in so doing engenders evil. And as from that fatal embrace, there comes first the conception and then the birth of sin. But sin also grows; it has its infancy of purpose and its maturity of act; and so the parable is continued. Sin, in its turn, grows up, and by its union with the will becomes the mother of a yet more terrible offspring, and that offspring is Death, the loss of the true life of the soul, which consists in its capacity for knowing God. The second of the two words rendered “bringeth forth” (better, perhaps, <span class="bld">engendereth</span>) differs from the first, and seems, as a less common word, to have been used for extraordinary or monstrous births (such e. g. as a woman’s bearing four or five children), and so is appropriate here. The word occurs again in <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>, where see note. In looking at the allegory as a whole we note: (1) its agreement as to the relation of sin and death, with the teaching of St Paul (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>); (2) its resemblance to like allegories in the literature of other nations, as in the well-known Choice of Hercules that bears the name of Prodicus, in which Pleasure appears with the garb and allurements of a harlot; (3) its expansion in the marvellous allegory of Sin and Death in Milton’s <span class="ital">Paradise Lost</span> (B. II. 745–814), where Satan represents Intellect and Will opposed to God, Sin its offspring, self-generated, and Death the fruit of the union of Mind and Will with Sin. In the incestuous union of Sin and Death that follows and in its horrid progeny, Milton seems to have sought to shadow forth the shame and foulness and misery in which even the fairest forms of sin finally issue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">Jam 1:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συλλαβοῦσα</span>, <span class="ital">when it hath conceived</span>) Sin arising from man’s will.—<span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαν</span>, <span class="ital">sin</span>) The act of sin.

Rev. has rendered &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, beareth, in order to avoid the repetition of bringeth forth. The verb is used by James only, here and at <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>. The image is interpreted in two ways. Either (1) Sin, figured as female, is already pregnant with death, and, when full grown, bringeth forth death (so Rev., and the majority of commentators). "The harlot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she beareth sin....Then the sin, that particular sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant with it, bringeth forth death" (Alford). Or (2) Sin, figured as male, when it has reached maturity, becomes the begetter of death. So the Vulgate, generat, and Wyc., gendereth. I am inclined to prefer this, since the other seems somewhat forced. It has the high endorsement of Bishop Lightfoot. There is a suggestive parallel passage in the "Agamemnon" of Aeschylus, 751-771:<p>"There is a saying old,<p>Uttered in ancient days,<p>That human bliss, full grown,<p>Genders, and dies not childless:<p>continued...</body></html>
