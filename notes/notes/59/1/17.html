Two words are translated by our one “gift”; the first is rather the act of giving, the second the gift itself, and the effect of both together is a climax to the statement of God’s benevolence. The difference between the two is observed in the Genevan version of 1557. “There are diversities of gifts” (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>), even as “one star differeth from another star in glory” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-41.htm" title="There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.">1Corinthians 15:41</a>), but “the same Spirit” is the giver of all. Where in St. John’s Gospel (<a href="/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>) we read, “Except a man be born again,” the most probable meaning is “from above,” expressed exactly as in the present case; and thus we know whence is the true birth of the soul.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh down from the Father of lights.</span>—Great difference of opinion is found concerning these “lights,” whether the term be figurative, as of goodness or wisdom; or a reference to the mysterious Urim (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) which flamed on the breast of Aaron; or spiritual, as of grace and glory; or material, viz., the “lights” set “in the firmament of heaven” (<a href="/context/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14-15</a>) “when the morning stars sang together” (<a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>). It were not amiss to take the whole of these interpretations, for they, and perhaps others, the purport of which we as yet can barely guess, are included in this Scripture. “God,” remarks Bishop Wordsworth, “is the Father of all lights—the light of the natural world, the sun, the moon, and stars, shining in the heavens; the light of reason and conscience; the light of His Law; the light of prophecy, shining in a dark place; the light of the gospel shining throughout the world; the light of apostles, confessors, martyrs, bishops, and priests, preaching that gospel to all nations; the light of the Holy Ghost shining in our hearts; the light of the heavenly city; God is the Father of them all. He is the everlasting Father of the everlasting Son, who is the Light of the world.” But that the mind of the sacred writer was mainly on the lights of the material universe may be seen from his next thought.<p><span class= "bld">With whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span>—The phraseology is almost scientific. There are changes, literally “parallaxes,” of the heavenly bodies themselves, and eclipses one of another by shadows projected through space, but no such variableness with God, nor changing of faintest shade. And even further, the greatest and most marvellous of His works on high “must be dissolved” (<a href="/2_peter/3-11.htm" title="Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness,">2Peter 3:11</a>), “the sun darkened, the moon not give her light, the stars fall from heaven” (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>), and the heavens themselves “be rolled together as a scroll” (<a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>). But if “the things which are seen are temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal” (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.">2Corinthians 4:18</a>). “I am the Lord,” is the burden of His latest prophet; “I change not” (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every good gift and every perfect gift - The difference between good and perfect here, it is not easy to mark accurately. It may be that the former means that which is benevolent in its character and tendency; the latter that which is entire, where there is nothing even apparently wanting to complete it; where it can be regarded as good as a whole and in all its parts. The general sense is, that God is the author of all good. Every thing that is good on the earth we are to trace to him; evil has another origin. Compare <a href="/matthew/13-28.htm">Matthew 13:28</a>.<p>Is from above - From God, who is often represented as dwelling above - in heaven.<p>And cometh down from the Father of lights - From God, the source and fountain of all light. Light, in the Scriptures, is the emblem ot knowledge, purity, happiness; and God is often represented as light. Compare <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>. Notes, <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. There is, doubtless, an allusion here to the heavenly bodies, among which the sun is the most brilliant. It appears to us to be the great original fountain of light, diffusing its radiance overall worlds. No cloud, no darkness seems to come from the sun, but it pours its rich effulgence on the farthest part of the universe. So it is with God. There is no darkness in him <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>; and all the moral light and purity which there is in the universe is to be traced to him. The word Father here is used in a sense which is common in Hebrew (Compare the notes at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>) as denoting that which is the source of anything, or that from which anything proceeds. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p>With whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning - The design here is clearly to contrast God with the sun in a certain respect. As the source of light, there is a strong resemblance. But in the sun there are certain changes. It does not shine on all parts of the earth at the same time, nor in the same manner all the year. It rises and sets; it crosses the line, and seems to go far to the south, and sends its rays obliquely on the earth; then it ascends to the north, recrosses the line, and sends its rays obliquely on southern regions. By its revolutions it produces the changes of the seasons, and makes a constant variety on the earth in the productions of different climes. In this respect God is not indeed like the sun. With him there is no variableness, not even the appearance of turning. He is always the same, at all seasons of the year, and in all ages; there is no change in his character, his mode of being, his purposes and plans. What he was millions of ages before the worlds were made, he is now; what he is now, he will be countless millions of ages hence. We may be sure that whatever changes there may be in human affairs; whatever reverses we may undergo; whatever oceans we may cross, or whatever mountains we may climb, or in whatever worlds we may hereafter take up our abode, God is the same. The word which is here rendered "variableness" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;  parallage&#772;) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means change, alteration, vicissitude, and would properly be applied to the changes observed in astronomy. See the examples quoted in Wetstein. The phrase rendered "shadow of turning" would properly refer to the different shade or shadow cast by the sun from an object, in its various revolutions, in rising and setting, and in its changes at the different seasons of the year. God, on the other hand, is as if the sun stood in the meridian at noon-day, and never cast any shadow. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. gift &#8230; gift&#8212;not the same words in Greek: the first, the act of giving, or the gift in its initiatory stage; the second, the thing given, the boon, when perfected. As the "good gift" stands in contrast to "sin" in its initiatory stage (Jas 1:15), so the "perfect boon" is in contrast to "sin when it is finished," bringing forth death (2Pe 1:3).<p>from above&#8212;(Compare Jas 3:15).<p>Father of lights&#8212;Creator of the lights in heaven (compare Job 38:28 [Alford]; Ge 4:20, 21; Heb 12:9). This accords with the reference to the changes in the light of the heavenly bodies alluded to in the end of the verse. Also, Father of the spiritual lights in the kingdom of grace and glory [Bengel]. These were typified by the supernatural lights on the breastplate of the high priest, the Urim. As "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (1Jo 1:5), He cannot in any way be the Author of sin (Jas 1:13), which is darkness (Joh 3:19).<p>no variableness &#8230; shadow of turning&#8212;(Mal 3:6). None of the alternations of light and shadow which the physical "lights" undergo, and which even the spiritual lights are liable to, as compared with God. "Shadow of turning," literally, the dark "shadow-mark" cast from one of the heavenly bodies, arising from its "turning" or revolution, for example, when the moon is eclipsed by the shadow of the earth, and the sun by the body of the moon. Bengel makes a climax, "no variation&#8212;not even the shadow of a turning"; the former denoting a change in the understanding; the latter, in the will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Every good gift; </span> Greek, giving; and so it may be distinct from <span class="ital">gift</span> in the next clause; to show, that whereas men sometimes give good gifts in all evil way, and with an evil mind, God’s giving, as well as gift, is always good; and therefore when we receive any thing of him, we should look not only to the thing itself, but to his bounty and goodness in giving it.

Whether of nature, providence, or grace, and especially the latter; spiritual gifts given along with Christ, or spiritual blessings in him; every such gift is; as the Vulgate Latin version reads, the "best" gift; better than those which only relate to the present life: and is "perfect" such as the gifts of righteousness, remission of sins, adoption, regeneration, and eternal life. The Jews say (k), that the good things of this world are not truly good, in comparison of the good things of the world to come, and are not , "a perfect good."

Schneckenburger arbitrarily explains it as if James had written: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΣΑ ΔΌΣΙς ΚΑῚ ΠᾶΝ ΔΏΡΗΜΑ ἌΝΩΘΕΝ ΚΑΤΑΒΑῖΝΟΝ ΤΈΛΕΙΌΝ ἘΣΤΙ</span></span></span>.[76]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄνωθεν</span>] = <span class="greekheb">οὐράνοθεν</span> (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="/acts/26-13.htm" title="At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.">Acts 26:13</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>, <a href="/context/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven....">John 6:32-33</a>), is put first for the sake of emphasis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐστι καταβαῖνον</span>] are not, with Wolf, Bengel, Kern, Bouman, and others, to be separated, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span> is to be joined to <span class="greekheb">ἄνωθεν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">καταβαῖνον</span> is added as an epexegesis; but to be united, and are put instead of <span class="greekheb">καταβαίνει</span>, only that by the participle the quality of the verbal idea is more brought out; see chap. <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a>; so also Wiesinger and A. Buttmann, p. 266 [E. T. 310]; Winer, p. 311 [E. T. 438], and Schirlitz, p. 317, on the other hand, regard the expression as entirely equivalent to <span class="greekheb">καταβαίνει</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="greekheb">καταβαῖνον</span> is explained from <span class="greekheb">ἄνωθεν</span>. The explanation of Laurentius: non cadens, sed descendens, quia <span class="ital">ordinarie</span> bona sua dona dat, is far-fetched.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν φώτων</span>] an epexegesis to the preceding. By <span class="greekheb">τὰ φῶτα</span> is to be understood neither spiritual light, whether knowledge (Hornejus), or joy (Michaelis), or goodness, wisdom (Wolf: omnis perfectio, bonitas, sapientia et prosperitas), or something similar, nor the spirits of light (<span class="ital">Schol. ap. Matt.</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἤτοι τῶν ἀγγελικῶν δυνάμεων</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἢ τῶν πεφωτισμένων ἀνθρώπων</span>; Lange: “the whole series of organs of revelation from Abraham to Christ, as the representatives of all good spirits”). Nor is there here any allusion to the Urim and Thummim of the high priest (Heisen); but by it are meant, as almost all modern expositors recognise, <span class="ital">the heavenly bodies</span> (see LXX. Psalms 135 :(136)7; <a href="/jeremiah/4-23.htm" title="I beheld the earth, and, see, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.">Jeremiah 4:23</a>) = <span class="greekheb">φωστῆρες</span>, LXX. <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14</a>. God is designated as the <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span> of these, because He is their Creator and Preserver. This designation, for which <a href="/job/38-28.htm" title="Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?">Job 38:28</a> cannot be appealed to, is surprising, as it is without analogy either in the O. or N. T. (otherwise with profane writers and Philo). It has, however, its ground in this, that James considers the light of the heavenly bodies as a reflection of the essential light of God. Since God is the Father of light, the symbol of the holy ones (Wiesinger), so He Himself must be light, and thus nothing dark (consequently not <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span>), but rather only all that is light, can proceed from Him. As the Father of lights, God, however, outshines these: their light is changing; His, on the contrary, is without change. The following words: <span class="ital">with whom there is no variation nor shadow (in consequence) of change</span>, express this idea; <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, whilst with the stars a <span class="greekheb">παραλλαγή</span> or <span class="greekheb">τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα</span> occurs, there is nothing similar to this with God.[77] According to Grotius, with whom various expositors agree, these expressions are <span class="ital">termini technici</span> of astronomy. But, in opposition to this, it is to be observed that <span class="greekheb">παραλλαγή</span> never occurs as an astronomical term (see Gebser <span class="ital">in loco</span>), and the astronomical signification of <span class="greekheb">τροπή</span> = solstitium, solstice (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΠΑῚ ΘΕΡΙΝΑΊ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΕΙΜΕΡΙΝΑΊ</span></span></span>; comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-18.htm" title="The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:">Wis 7:18</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΠῶΝ ἈΛΛΑΓΆς</span></span></span>), is not here suitable, as the sun is not mentioned specially, nor is an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΚΊΑΣΜΑ</span></span></span> effected by the solstice. James here uses not the language of astronomy, but that of ordinary life (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΛΛΑΓΉ</span></span></span> is to be understood quite generally, <span class="ital">variation.</span> James adds to this general idea, in order to bring prominently forward that the essential light of God is not, as is the case with the stars, obscured by anything, the more definite idea <span class="greekheb">τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποσκίασμα</span> has not an active (de Wette: “casting a shadow”), but a passive signification, <span class="ital">being shaded</span> (so Brückner); and <span class="greekheb">τροπῆς</span> assigns the reason (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΚΊΑΣΜΑ</span></span></span> quae oritur e <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΠῇ</span></span></span>, Schneckenburger): thus the shadowing of the stars, which is effected by <span class="ital">their changeable position:</span>[78] for that James has founded his idea in a change in the stars themselves is not probable.[79] Luther’s translation: “the change of light and darkness” (similarly Stolz: “changing obscuration”), is only justified if it were said <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΠῊ ἈΠΟΣΚΙΆΣΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span>. Deviating entirely from the above explanation, the Greek interpreters take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΚΊΑΣΜΑ</span></span></span> = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἼΧΝΟς</span></span></span>; Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤῚ ΤΟῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΔῈ ΜΈΧΡΙς ὙΠΟΝΟΊΑς ΤΙΝῸς ὙΠΟΒΟΛΉ</span></span></span>; Suidas: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤῚ ΤΟῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛΟΙΏΣΕΩς ΚΑῚ ΜΕΤΑΒΟΛῆς ἼΧΝΟς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ὉΜΟΊΩΜΑ ΦΑΝΤΑΣΊΑς</span></span></span>; and following them several recent writers; Morus: ne tantillum mutationes; Rosenmüller: no shadow of change; so Hensler and others. But in this signification <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΚΊΑΣΜΑ</span></span></span> never elsewhere occurs; also the here <span class="ital">essential</span> idea of obscuration (Bengel: <span class="greekheb">ἀποσκίασμα</span>, <span class="ital">opponitur luminibus</span>) would be lost.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The form <span class="greekheb">ἔν<span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ι</span></span></span> (besides here in the N.

Similarly it is said of Wisdom: <span class="greekheb">ἔστι γὰρ αὕτη εὐπρεπεστέρα ἡλίου</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν ἄστρων θέσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">φωτὶ συγκρινομένη εὑρίσκεται προτέρα</span>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-29.htm" title="For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.">Wis 7:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[78] Incorrectly Lange explains the expression: “of the obscuration of the earth effected by the diurnal phenomenal revolution of the sun, moon, and stars.” And the proper idea which James has in view is, according to Lange, that God “makes no revolution with the Old Testament which would cast a night-shadow on the New, nor does He suffer the New Testament to cast a night-shadow on the Old!!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] Without reason, Baumgarten, Schneckenburger, and others assume that James here alludes to the astrological superstitions of the Jews.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">Jam 1:17</a>. The following saying of R. Chaninah (first century, A.D.) is preserved: <span class="greekheb">א״ר חנינא אין דבר רע יורד מלמעלה׃</span> (“R. Chaninah said, ‘No evil thing cometh down from above’ ”.). On the possible connection between this verse and the preceding section, see Introduction IV., § 1.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθὴ καὶ πᾶν δώρημα τέλειον</span>: Mayor remarks on this: “It will be observed that the words make a hexameter line, with a short syllable lengthened by the metrical stress. I think Ewald is right in considering it to be a quotation from some Hellenistic poem.… The authority of a familiar line would add persuasion to the writer’s words, and account for the somewhat subtle distinction between <span class="greekheb">δοσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">δω</span>. <span class="greekheb">τελ</span>.”. In Theodotion’s version of <a href="/daniel/2-6.htm" title="But if you show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 2:6</a>, occur the words: … <span class="greekheb">δόματα καὶ δωρεὰς</span> …, which represent <span class="greekheb">מתנן</span> and <span class="greekheb">נבזבה</span> in the corresponding Aramaic (the Septuagint has another reading); the distinction between these two is perhaps that the former refers to gifts in the ordinary sense, while the latter is a gift given in return for something done, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, a reward; but it cannot be said that the Greek reflects this distinction, though it is worthy of note that Philo makes a special distinction between them, “inasmuch as the latter noun is much stronger than the former, and contains the idea of greatness and perfection which is lacking in the former; Philo, <span class="ital">De Cherub.</span>, 25; and so <span class="ital">De Leg. Alleg.</span>, iii. 70, where he applies to the latter noun the same epithet ‘perfect’ as in the Greek of the verse before us” (Knowling).—<span class="greekheb">ἄνωθέν ἐστιν</span>: it is a question whether one should read: “Every good gift … from above comes down from …,” so the Peshiṭtâ; or “Every good gift … is from above, coming down from …”; Mayor thinks that on the whole “the rhythm and balance of the sentence is better preserved by separating <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span> from <span class="greekheb">καταβαῖνον</span>”.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν φώτων</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> on the one hand, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/43-9.htm" title="At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches.">Sir 43:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">Κάλλος οὐρανοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">δόξα ἄστρων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κόσμος φωτίζων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑψίστοις Κύριος</span>; and, on the other <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς φῶς ἐστιν καὶ σκοτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὔκ ἐστιν οὐδεμία</span>. There can be no doubt that in the passage before us this double meaning of light, literal and spiritual, is meant.—<span class="greekheb">παραλλαγή</span>: only here in the N.T., and in 4 Kings 9:28 (Septuagint); it is rendered <span class="greekheb">שוחלפא</span> in the Peshiṭtâ, a word which is used variously of “change,” “caprice,” and even “apostasy” (see Brockelmann, <span class="ital">Lex. Syr.</span>, s.v.). In Greek, according to Mayor, the word may be taken “to express the contrast between the natural sun, which varies its position in the sky from hour to hour and month to month, and the eternal source of all light”.—<span class="greekheb">τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα</span>: neither of these words is found elsewhere in the N.T., and the latter does not occur in the Septuagint either; the former is used in the Septuagint of the movements of the heavenly bodies, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-14.htm" title="And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,">Deuteronomy 33:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ καθʼ ὥραν γενημάτων ἡλίου τροπῶν</span> …; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/job/38-33.htm" title="Know you the ordinances of heaven? can you set the dominion thereof in the earth?">Job 38:33</a>. The meaning of the latter part of the verse before us is well brought out by Luther: “Bei welchem ist keine Veränderung noch Wechsel des Lichts und Finsterniss”. If, as hinted above, there is a connection between this verse and the section <a href="/context/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him....">Jam 1:5-8</a>, the meaning may perhaps be expressed thus: When, in answer to prayer, God promises the gift of wisdom, it is certain to be given, for He does not change; <span class="ital">cf.</span> for the thought, <a href="/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμεταμέλητα γὰρτὰ χαρίσματα καὶ ἡ κλῆσις τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Every good gift and every perfect gift</span>] The two nouns are different in the Greek, the first expressing the abstract <span class="ital">Acts of giving</span>, the second the <span class="ital">gift</span> as actually bestowed. The perfection of the one flows from the goodness of the other. The “perfect gift” carries our thoughts beyond all temporal blessings which, though good, have yet an element of incompleteness, to the greater gifts of righteousness and peace and joy; the gift, i. e. of the Holy Spirit, which is the crowning gift of all. Singularly enough, the axiom, if we may so call it, falls into the cadence of a Greek hexameter, and it is conceivable that it may have been a quotation from a poem, or possibly from an early Christian hymn. Like instances of metre are found, besides the direct quotations in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, <a href="/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>, in the Greek of <a href="/hebrews/12-13.htm" title="And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.">Hebrews 12:13</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>. The whole passage reminds us once more of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/7-11.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?">Matthew 7:11</a>) and of the parallel promise in <a href="/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is from above</span>] The perfect gifts come then, as the new birth of the soul comes, from Heaven, not from Earth (comp. <a href="/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>, as in the margin), as does the true wisdom (chap. <a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">James 3:15</a>; <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>). The prominence of the word and the thought in the Epistle is one of the links that connect it with the Gospel of St John, in which a like prominence is traceable (<a href="/john/3-7.htm" title="Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.">John 3:7</a>; <a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>; <a href="/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the Father of lights</span>] The plural is used to express the thought, that light in all its forms, natural (as in the “great lights” of <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm" title="He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain; he brings the wind out of his treasuries.">Psalm 135:7</a>), intellectual, spiritual, is an efflux from Him “who is light, and in whom is no darkness at all” (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>). This axiom as to the Divine Nature was also common to the two great teachers of the Church of the Circumcision, as it was to the teaching of the Apostle of the Gentiles, when he describes the children of God as being also “children of light” (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a>). There may possibly be a reference to the Urim and Thummim, the “lights” and “perfections” which symbolised God’s gifts of wisdom in its highest forms (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>).

Here it is apparently suggested by the word “lights,” which primarily conveyed the thought of the heavenly bodies as the light-givers of the world. They, St James seems to say, have their changes, but not so their Creator and their Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shadow of turning</span>] i.e. <span class="bld">shadow caused by turning</span>. The latter word, from which we get our “<span class="ital">trope</span>,” and “<span class="ital">tropic</span>,” is applied, as in the LXX. of <a href="/job/38-33.htm" title="Know you the ordinances of heaven? can you set the dominion thereof in the earth?">Job 38:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-14.htm" title="And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>, to the apparent motion of the lights of heaven, and so to any changes. The former is also a quasi-scientific term, applied to the effect produced on the sun’s disc by the moon in an eclipse. St James does not appear to use the terms with any very strict accuracy, but the fact that he employs them at all, and that they occur nowhere else in the New Testament, is in itself interesting as connecting him with the form of wisdom described in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-17.htm" title="For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:...">Wis 7:17-20</a>, which deals with “the alterations of the turning of the sun” (the two terms are nearly identical with those which St James uses) and “the change of seasons.” Science, he seems to say, deals with the mutability of phænomena. Faith, and therefore Wisdom, rest on the immutability of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">Jam 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶσα</span>, <span class="ital">every</span>[11]) The connection of the discourse is evident, when thus resolved: <span class="greekheb">δόσις</span>, a “<span class="ital">gift</span>” (a <span class="ital">giving</span>), which is altogether good; <span class="greekheb">δώρημα</span>, <span class="ital">a boon</span>, which is altogether perfect.

The words “<span class="ital">good</span>” and “<span class="ital">perfect</span>” form the predicate of the sentence; “<span class="ital">gift</span>” and “<span class="ital">boon</span>” are the subject.[12] “<span class="ital">Every</span>,” in both clauses, if the meaning is considered, belongs to the subject.[13] Comp. “<span class="ital">all</span>,” <a href="/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">Jam 1:2</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">δόσις</span>, <span class="ital">a giving, a gift</span>) A “<span class="ital">good gift</span>,” as opposed to “<span class="ital">sin</span>,” denotes those things which, from the beginning and by daily increase, tend to righteousness and piety. <span class="ital">A</span> “<span class="ital">perfect boon</span>,” as opposed to “<span class="ital">when it is finished</span>” and “<span class="ital">death</span>,” denotes those things which relate to <span class="ital">perfection</span> of character and a happy life: comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἄνωθέν ἐστι καταβαῖνον</span>) <span class="ital">is that which descends from above</span>.

There follows, in the next verse, <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκύησεν</span>, “<span class="ital">He begat us</span>.” He stands in the place of father and mother. He is the Father even of spiritual lights in the kingdom of grace and glory. Much more then is He Himself “<span class="ital">Light</span>” <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>. Immediately on mention of “<span class="ital">light</span>,” there is added, as usual, mention of <span class="ital">life</span>, by regeneration, <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πὰρ ᾧ οὐκ ἔνι παραλλαγὴ ἢ τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα</span>, <span class="ital">with whom is no variableness, or shadow of turning</span>) <span class="greekheb">Παραλλαγὴ</span> denotes a change in the understanding (see <a href="/2_kings/9-20.htm" title="And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and comes not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.">2 Kings 9:20</a>,[14] Septuagint); <span class="greekheb">τροπὴ</span>, a change in the will. In each word there is a metaphor taken from the stars, and used with singular propriety in this passage, where mention is made of <span class="ital">lights</span>. <span class="greekheb">Παραλλαγὴ</span> and <span class="greekheb">τροπὴ</span> occur in nature (see <span class="greekheb">τροπὰς</span> in <a href="/job/38-33.htm" title="Know you the ordinances of heaven? can you set the dominion thereof in the earth?">Job 38:33</a>), which has a daily vicissitude of day and night, and has at one time a greater length of day, at another time a greater length of night; but there is nothing of this kind in God. He is pure, unsullied [nothing but] Light. <span class="greekheb">Παραλλαγὴ</span> and <span class="greekheb">τροπὴ</span>, <span class="ital">variation and change</span>, if they take place at all, take place in us, and not in the Father of lights. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποσκίασμα</span> sometimes has the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὁμοίωμα</span>, <span class="ital">likeness:</span> for so Hesychius explains it; whence Gregory of Nazianzus uses as synonyms, <span class="greekheb">τὸ τῆς ἀληθείας ἴνδαλμα καὶ ἀποσκίασμα</span>, <span class="ital">the appearance and likeness of the truth</span>; and in Cicero, as Budæus observes, <span class="ital">the outline of an object</span> is opposed to <span class="ital">its perfection</span>. But in this passage it is opposed to <span class="ital">lights</span>, and is therefore used more correctly; so that <span class="greekheb">ἀποσκίασμα τροπῆς</span> is <span class="ital">the first casting of a shadow, which is accompanied by a revolution</span>. The same Hebraistic use of the genitive occurs shortly after in <a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a>, <span class="ital">superfluity of naughtiness</span>, from which we may infer, that there is an opposition between the words <span class="ital">variableness</span> and <span class="ital">good gift</span>; just as <span class="ital">shadow of turning</span> is opposed to the expression, <span class="ital">perfect boon</span>. <span class="greekheb">Παραλλαγὴ</span> denotes something greater: hence there is a gradation in the negative sentence: <span class="ital">not even the shadow of turning</span>. This at length [this, and this only] makes up <span class="ital">perfection</span>; the former is <span class="ital">good</span>. He is <span class="ital">more perfect</span> who has not even the shadow of turning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11] <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα</span> seems to be used like the Latin <span class="ital">merus</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">nothing but</span>. See Raphelius on the passage.—T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[12] By <span class="greekheb">δόσις</span>, we may understand the gift or act of giving; by <span class="greekheb">δώρημα</span>, the fulness of the benefit bestowed.—T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[13] “The giving and gift that comes from above is all perfect;” not as Engl. Vers.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] <span class="greekheb">ἐν παραλλαγῇ ἐγένετο</span>, is used to denote the violence of Jehu’s driving.—T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Δόσις</span>, the <span class="ital">Acts of giving</span>, the gift in its <span class="ital">initiatory</span> act: <span class="greekheb">δώρημα</span>, the <span class="ital">thing given</span>, the <span class="ital">boon</span> when <span class="ital">perfected</span>.—E.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every good gift</span>, etc. The words form a hexameter verse, though this is probably accidental, and no sign that they are a quotation. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> should be distinguished. "Every kind of gift that is good, and every one that is perfect in its kind" (Dean Scott). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> occur together in the LXX. in <a href="/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>. They are expressly distinguished by Philo, who says that the latter involves the idea of magnitude and fullness, which is wanting to the former (see Lightfoot on 'Revision,' p. 77) "Every good gift and every perfect boon, R.V. <span class="cmt_word">The Father of lights</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The word must refer to the heavenly bodies, of which God may be said to be the Father, in that he is their Creator (for "Father," in the sense of Creator, cf. <a href="/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>). From him who "made the stars also" comes down every good and perfect gift, and with him "there can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning." These last words appear to fix the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span> is used in the LXX. as in classical writers for the changes of the heavenly bodies (see <a href="/job/38-33.htm">Job 38:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>; Wisd. 7:18). <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, "there is no room for."

It enlarges slightly upon the other word in emphasizing the gift as free, large, full; an idea which is further developed in <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>, of his own will. The Rev., rather awkwardly, endeavors to bring out the distinction by the word boon, for which the American Revisers insist on retaining gift. Boon originally means a petition; favor being a secondary and later sense, as of something given in response to a petition. The word is of Scandinavian origin, and the meaning favor seems to indicate a confusion with the Latin bonus, good; French, bon.<p>Perfect<p>Enlarges upon good, bringing out more distinctly the moral quality of the gift.<p>And cometh down (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>A present participle, to be construed with &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, is from above.
