but—most considerate offer—he can stand; or, if he prefer it, sit under the great man’s footstool, lower down, that is, on the floor beneath. We know Christ’s words for those who loved of old “the chief seats in the synagogues” (<a href="/matthew/23-6.htm" title="And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,">Matthew 23:6</a>), nor can there be doubt as to their full application now. What is to be urged in excuse for the special pews in churches and chapels, hired and appropriated, furnished luxuriously, and secured by bolt and lock? If in the high places sit the men and women in goodly raiment still, while the poorly clad are crowded into side benches and corners, or beneficently told to stand and wait till room be found somewhere beneath the daintier feet,—how can there be escape from condemnation on the charge which follows?—namely this—<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing - If you show him superior attention on account of his rich and gay apparel, giving him a seat by himself, and treating others with neglect or contempt. Religion does not forbid proper respect to rank, to office, to age, or to distinguished talents and services, though even in such cases it does not require that we should feel that such persons have any peculiar claims to salvation, or that they are not on a level with all others, as sinners before God; it does not forbid that a man who has the means of procuring for himself an eligible pew in a church should be permitted to do so; but it requires that men shall be regarded and treated according to their moral worth, and not according to their external adorning; that all shall be considered as in fact on a level before God, and entitled to the privileges which grow out of the worship of the Creator. A stranger coming into any place of worship, no matter what his rank, dress, or complexion, should be treated with respect, and everything should be done that can be to win his heart to the service of God.<p>And say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place - Margin, as in Greek, "well" or "seemly;" that is, in an honorable place near the pulpit; or in some elevated place where he would be conspicuous. The meaning is, you treat him with distinguished marks of respect on the first appearance, merely from the indications that he is a rich man, without knowing any thing about his character.<p>And say to the poor, Stand thou there - Without even the civility of offering him a seat at all. This may be presumed not often to occur in a Christian church; yet it practically does sometimes, when no disposition is evinced to furnish a stranger with a seat.<p>Or sit here under my footstool - Perhaps some seats in the places of worship were raised, so that even the footstool would be elevated above a lower seat.

Many ancient expositors understand this as a figurative representation of the preference which was generally given in the congregation to the rich; this is arbitrary. The whole description points rather to something which James has actually in view; but in reprimanding this, he condemns partiality generally, which certainly showed itself in many other ways. By the descriptive words <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβλέψητε</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὴν λαμπράν</span>, which precede <span class="greekheb">εἴπητε</span> (in reference to the poor there is only <span class="greekheb">εἴπητε</span>), is indicated in a lively manner the admiring look at the external glitter; <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβλέπειν</span>, emphatice sumendum est (Pott); the rich man is characteristically described as <span class="greekheb">ὁ φορῶν τὴν ἐσθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λαμπράν</span>; the splendid garment is that which attracts the eye, the character of the man is entirely overlooked; <span class="greekheb">φορεῖν</span>, a secondary form of <span class="greekheb">φέρειν</span>, is also in <a href="/matthew/11-8.htm" title="But what went you out for to see?

The form <span class="greekheb">κάθου</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">κάθησο</span>) is foreign to classical Greek; see Winer, p. 75 [E. T. 98].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καλῶς</span> refers to comfort (Wiesinger); it is not = honorifice (Wahl); and still less is it to be resolved into “Be so good as” (Storr). A place is pointed out to the rich man, where he can be comfortably seated, whilst to the poor man it is said <span class="ital">stand</span> there. The second clause, separated from the first by <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>, is not a special address, but the two clauses form <span class="ital">one</span> saying, whilst after <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span> a thought is to be supplied, as “If thou wilt rather sit;” by the addition of these words the depreciation of the poor is yet more strongly marked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιον</span>] means not <span class="ital">under</span>, but <span class="ital">below my footstool</span> (Wiesinger), by which the floor is pointed out as the fitting place for the poor to sit (Bouman). “The expression involves contempt: as it were under one’s feet. Not <span class="ital">on</span> the footstool” (Lange). The word <span class="greekheb">ὑποπόδιον</span> (not <span class="ital">unicum</span>, as Wiesinger asserts) belongs only to the later classics. Often in N.

We do not know whether the first meeting-places of the Christian society followed the same arrangements, or whether then, as at a later period, the Table of the Lord took the place which had been occupied by the ark, and led them to covet the places that were near it, and therefore well placed for seeing and hearing the officiating elder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Stand thou there</span> …] The Christian, probably the elder or deacon, is supposed to point the poor man to his place at the other end of the synagogue, far from sight and hearing, giving him, it may be, the alternative of a seat on the ground, just below what we should call the “stall,” in which the rich man was invited to take his place, with a stool for his feet to rest on.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/2-3.htm" title="And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:">Jam 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπιβλέψητε</span>, <span class="ital">ye look upon</span>) with admiration.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν φοροῦντα</span>, <span class="ital">him that weareth</span>) although you are ignorant who he is; when perhaps he may be a heathen.—<span class="greekheb">σὺ</span>—<span class="greekheb">σὺ</span>, <span class="ital">thou</span>—<span class="ital">thou</span>) This has here the force of a proper name.—<span class="greekheb">κάθου ὧδε</span>, <span class="ital">sit here</span>) The antithesis is, <span class="ital">stand there</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καλῶς</span>) <span class="greekheb">הטיב</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greekheb">καλῶς</span>, honourably.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ</span>, there) at a distance from us.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye have respect (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Lit., ye look upon, with the idea of respectful consideration; ye regard.
