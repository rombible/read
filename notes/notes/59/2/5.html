It were folly to deny it. But this passage, like so many others, gives the reason for that choice. “The poor of this world” are His chosen; not merely for their poverty, although it may have been the air, so to speak, in which the virtues which endeared them to Him have flourished most. And these are rich for present and for future. They know Him “now by faith,” and “after this life have the fruition of His glorious Godhead.” “Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God” (<a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>). The way thereto for them is nearer and less cumbered than for the rich, if only they fulfil the Scripture (comp. <a href="/matthew/6-3.htm" title="But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:">Matthew 6:3</a>), and be poor “in spirit:” then, indeed, are they “heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him.” The world must always measure by its own standard, and consider poverty a curse, just as it looks on pain and trouble as evil. But the teaching of God, declared most eloquently in the life of His blessed Son, is the direct opposite to this. In a worship which demands of its votaries costly gifts and offerings—and every religion tends downwards to such desires—the rich man has a golden pavement to his future bliss. No wonder, therefore, that again and again the voice of the Spirit of God has pointed out the narrow way, and the eternal excellency of truth, and faith, and love, the riches easiest of acquisition by the poor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/james/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?...">James 2:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hearken </span>— As if he had said, Stay, consider, ye that judge thus.

St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hearken, my beloved brethren - The apostle now proceeds to show that the rich, as such, had no special claim on their favor, and that the poor in fact might be made more entitled to esteem than they were. For a view of the arguments by which he does this, compare the analysis of the chapter.<p>Hath not God chosen the poor of this world? - Those who are poor so far as this world is concerned, or those who have not wealth. This is the first argument which the apostle suggests why the poor should not be treated with neglect. It is, that God has had special reference to them in choosing those who should be his children. The meaning is not that he is not as willing to save the rich as the poor, for he has no partiality; but that there are circumstances in the condition of the poor which make it more likely that they will embrace the offers of the gospel than the rich; and that in fact the great mass of believers is taken from those who are in comparatively humble life. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</a>. The fact that God has chosen one to be an "heir of the kingdom" is as good a reason now why he should not be treated with neglect, as it was in the times of the apostles.<p>Rich in faith - Though poor in this world's goods, they are rich in a higher and more important sense. They have faith in God their Saviour; and in this world of trial and of sin, that is a more valuable possession than piles of hoarded silver or gold. A man who has that is sure that he will have all that is truly needful for him in this world and the next; a man who has it not, though he may have the wealth of Croesus, will be utterly without resources in respect to the great wants of his existence.<p>"Give what thou wilt, without thee we are poor;<p>And with thee rich, take what thou wilt away."<p>Faith in God the Saviour will answer more purposes, and accomplish more valuable ends for man, than the wealth of the Indies could: and this the poor may have as well as the rich.

As to a matter of importance, and worthy of attention and regard; being an instance of the divine conduct towards the poor, and carries in it a strong argument against respect of persons: <p>hath not God chosen the poor of this world? this interrogative is equal to a strong affirmative; and the sense is, that God has chosen the poor of this world; and which is to be understood, not of the choice of them to an office, either in church or state; though sometimes this has been the case, as the instances of David, and the apostles of Christ, show; nor merely to the Gospel, and the outward means of grace, though the poor have the Gospel preached unto them; nor of the effectual calling, though this is true; but of eternal election, which is the act of God the Father, and passed before the foundation of the world; and is an act of sovereign grace, and is irrespective of faith, holiness, and good works; and is the source of all grace, and remains immutable and irrevocable: now the objects of this are, "the poor of this world"; that is, who are poor with respect to the things of this world, but not with respect to the things of another world; for they are chosen to be heirs of a kingdom, and shall enjoy it; though these are not all chosen by God, nor are they the only persons that are chosen; there are some poor men that are not chosen, and are miserable here and hereafter; and there are some rich men that are chosen; but for the most part, or generally speaking, they are not many mighty, nor noble, but the poorer sort, which God has made choice of to partake both of grace and glory. It may be the apostle has some peculiar respect to the poor among the Gentiles, whom God had chosen; it was usual with the Jews to call the Gentiles the world, and they were Jews the apostle now writes to, and who were scattered abroad among the Gentiles; and therefore he might very aptly call them "this world", among whom they lived; and suggest to them, that God had chosen some of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews, and even some of the poorer sort of them; and it was usual with the Jews to distinguish between , "the poor of Israel", and , "the poor of the world", or   "the poor of the nations of the world" (u): the Alexandrian copy, and some others, leave out the word "this", and so the Syriac and Arabic versions, which makes the phrase more agreeable to the Jewish way of speaking. The Gentiles, in common, were despicable with the Jews, and especially the poor of them; and yet God chose these: <p>rich in faith; not that they were so, or were considered as such, when chosen, and so were chosen because of their faith; for then also they were, or were considered as heirs of the kingdom, which would be monstrously absurd; and yet there is as much reason, from the text, for the one, as for the other; but the sense is, that they were chosen "to be rich in faith"; and so the Syriac version supplies in the next clause, "that they might be heirs"; which if it had been placed before this clause also, would have been right; election to grace is signified in the one, and election to glory in the other: men are chosen, not because they do believe, or shall believe, but that they might believe; and which faith they have in consequence of election; and which when they have, they are rich: faith is a rich precious grace itself; it is a part of the riches of grace, and is more worth than thousands of gold and silver; and it is the means of receiving and enjoying much riches, as Christ the pearl of great price himself, and all spiritual blessings along with him; such as the rich robe of his righteousness, full pardon of sin, which is according to the riches of his grace, and adoption, which makes men heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, and even the eternal inheritance itself, both the promise of it, and a right unto it; all which are said to be received by faith; and therefore believers, how poor soever they may be, to this world's goods, are truly rich men: <p>and heirs of the kingdom; of glory, which is prepared for all the chosen ones, from the foundation of the world; and is freely given to them by their Father, and to which they are called in the effectual calling; and hence they are made kings and priests unto God, and have crowns and thrones provided for them: the Alexandrian copy reads, "heirs of the promise which he hath promised to them that love him"; that is, which God has promised them, as the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read; not that their love to God is the cause of this kingdom, or of their choice to it, or of the promise of it to them; all which flow from the love of God to them; but this is descriptive of the persons who shall enjoy it, and may expect to enjoy it, as in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>. <p>(u) T.

In the <span class="ital">Receptus</span> <span class="greekheb">πτωχοὺς τοῦ κόσμου</span> the genitive is to be understood as in the expression <span class="greekheb">τὰ μωρὰ τοῦ κόσμου</span>, etc., <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>; see Meyer <span class="ital">in loco</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πλουσίους ἐν πίστει</span>] is not in apposition with <span class="greekheb">τοὺς πτωχοὺς</span> (Luther, Baumgarten, Semler, Hottinger, Gebser, Bouman, Lange, and others),[114] but the completion of <span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο</span>, stating to what God has chosen the poor (Beza, Wolf, Morus, Knapp, Storr, Schneckenburger, Kern, Theile, de Wette, Wiesinger, and others); see <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span>, as in the expression <span class="greekheb">πλούσιος ἐν ἐλέει</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm" title="But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,">Ephesians 2:4</a> (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.">2 Corinthians 9:11</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1 Timothy 6:18</a>), the object is not stated wherein they are rich (Luther: “who are rich in the faith”), but the sphere within which riches is imparted to them; similarly Wiesinger explains it: “rich in their position as believers.” James wished primarily to mark the contrast that the <span class="ital">poor</span> are appointed to be <span class="ital">rich</span>, namely, so far as they are believers; the context gives the more exact statement of their riches: riches in the possessions of the heavenly kingdom is meant; this the following clause indicates.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Calvin: non qui fidei magnitudine abundant, sed quos Deus variis Spiritus sui donis locupletavit, quae fide percipimus.[115]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="greekheb">ἡ βασιλεία</span> occurs also elsewhere, without the addition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> or similar terms, as a designation of the kingdom of God, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/13-38.htm" title="The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;">Matthew 13:38</a>.

He accordingly (the article is not to be overlooked) divides men into these two classes, the poor and the rich, and designates, not the latter, but the former, as those whom God has chosen and appointed to be rich in faith,[116] namely, to be heirs of the kingdom; not as if <span class="ital">all</span> the poor received the <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span>, but his meaning is that those whom God has chosen belong to <span class="ital">this</span> class, whereas those belonging to the class of the rich had not been chosen. James did not require to point out the truth of this statement; the Christians, to whom he wrote, were a living testimony of it, for they all belonged to that class; and although some among them were <span class="greekheb">πλούσιοι</span>, yet, on the one hand, what Christ says in <a href="/context/matthew/19-23.htm" title="Then said Jesus to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 19:23-26</a> holds good, and, on the other hand, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:...">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</a> is to be compared.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With this divine choice the conduct of his readers stood in direct contradiction when they treated a poor man—thus one who belonged to the class of those chosen by God—contemptuously, and that on account of his poverty. What directly follows expresses this contradiction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[114] If <span class="greekheb">πλουσίους</span> is taken as in apposition, then here riches in faith forms the reason of the choice; but by this the keenness of the thought contained in the oxymorum is entirely blunted: it is also arbitrary to separate the two ideas <span class="greekheb">πλουσίους</span> and <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμους</span> united by <span class="greekheb">καί</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[115] Kern: <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span> indicates that it is faith itself which makes the Christian <span class="ital">inwardly</span> rich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[116] It is to be observed that <span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο</span> does not here refer only to <span class="greekheb">πλουσίους</span>, as if <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> were to be considered as the condition on which the <span class="greekheb">πτωχοί</span> were chosen to be <span class="ital">rich</span>, but to the combined expression <span class="greekheb">πλουσίους ἐν πίστει</span>, so that also <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> is to be considered as an effect of the divine choice. The same view lies at the foundation of what Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a> (see Meyer <span class="ital">in loco</span>) and elsewhere often expresses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/james/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">Jam 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀκούσατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί</span>: This expression, which one would expect to hear rather in a vigorous address, reveals the writer as one who was also an impassioned speaker; <span class="ital">cf.</span> in the same spirit, the frequent <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>, and especially, <span class="greekheb">ἄγε νῦν</span>, <a href="/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">Jam 4:13</a>, <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο</span>: a very significant term in the mouth of a Jew when addressing Jews; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead....">Deuteronomy 14:1-2</a>, <span class="greekheb">Υἱοί ἐστε Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὅτι λαὸς ἅγιος εἶ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ σὲ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ὁ θεός σου γενέσθαι σε αὐτῷ λαὸν περιούσιον</span> … <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/13-17.htm" title="The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelled as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.">Acts 13:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. There is an interesting saying in <span class="ital">Chag</span>. 9<span class="ital">b</span> where it is said that poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people.—<span class="greekheb">πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, poor in the estimation of the world; the reading <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κόσμου</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ τούτῳ</span> loses this point; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/10-9.htm" title="Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,">Matthew 10:9</a>; <a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πλουσίους ἐν πίστει</span>: “Oblique predicate” (Mayor). In the <span class="ital">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, Gad. vii. 6 we read: “For the poor man, if, free from envy, he pleaseth the Lord in all things, is blessed beyond all men” (the Greek text reads <span class="greekheb">πλουτεῖ</span> which Charles holds to be due to a corruption in the original Hebrew text which reads <span class="greekheb">יְאֻשַּׁר</span> = <span class="greekheb">μακαριστός ἐστι</span>). See, for the teaching of our Lord, <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>; <a href="/luke/12-21.htm" title="So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.">Luke 12:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πίστις</span> is used here rather in the sense of trust than in the way in which it is used in <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας</span>: the Kingdom must refer to that of the Messiah, see <a href="/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord.

It is of importance to remember that the Messianic Kingdom to which reference is made in this verse was originally, among the Jews, differentiated from the “future life” which is apparently referred to in <a href="/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">Jam 1:12</a>, … <span class="greekheb">λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν</span>. There was a distinction, fundamentally present, though later on confused, in Jewish theology, between the “Kingdom of Heaven” over which God reigns, and that of the Kingdom of Israel over which the Messiah should reign. An integral part of the Messianic hope was the doctrine of a resurrection (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/isaiah/24-10.htm" title="The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.">Isaiah 24:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>). This first assumed definite form, apparently, under the impulse of the idea that those who had suffered martyrdom for the Law (<span class="ital">Torah</span>) were worthy to share in the future glories of Israel. In the crudest form of the doctrine the resurrection was confined to the Holy Land—those buried elsewhere would have to burrow through the ground to Palestine—and to Israelites. And the trumpet-blast which was to be the signal for the ingathering of the exiles would also arouse the sleeping dead (<span class="ital">cf. Berachoth</span>, 15<span class="ital">b</span>, 4 <a href="/ezra/4-23.htm" title="Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.">Ezra 4:23</a> ff.; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). According to the older view, the Kingdom was to follow the resurrection and judgment; but the later and more widely held view was that a temporary Messianic Kingdom would be established on the earth, and that this would be followed by the Last Judgment and the Resurrection which would close the Messianic Era. This was to be followed by a new heaven and a new earth. In the eschatological development which took place during the first century B.C. Paradise came to be regarded as the abode of the righteous and elect in an intermediate state; from there they will pass to the Messianic Kingdom, and then, after the final judgment they enter heaven and eternal life. In our Epistle there are some reflections of these various conceptions and beliefs, but they have entered into a simpler and more spiritual phase. That the reference in the verse before us is to the Messianic Kingdom seems indubitable both on account of the mention of the “Lord Jesus Christ” (Messiah) with which the section opens, showing that the thought of our Lord was in the mind of the writer, and because of the mention of the “Kingdom,” and also on account of the direct mention of the coming of the Messiah as Judge, later on in <a href="/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain....">Jam 5:7-9</a>. And if this is so then we may perhaps see in the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς ἐξελέξατο</span> a reference to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/james/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Hath not God chosen</span> …] Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">did not God choose?</span> as referring to the special election of the poor by Christ as the heirs of blessings and the messengers of His Kingdom (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>; <a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the poor of this world</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">in this world</span>, i. e. “as far as this world is concerned.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rich in faith</span>] The construction of the words is (to use a technical phrase) that of a secondary predicate, “God had chosen the poor in this world as, i.e. to be, rich in faith, as in the region in which they lived and moved.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised</span> …] Here, as before (ch. <a href="/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>), it is scarcely possible to exclude a direct reference to the words of Christ, as in <a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>; <a href="/context/luke/12-31.htm" title="But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you....">Luke 12:31-32</a>, and so we get indirect proof of a current knowledge, at the early period at which St James wrote, of teaching that was afterwards recorded in the written Gospels. Some of the better MSS., however, give “heirs of the promise.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to them that love him</span>?] Care is taken not to lead men to suppose that poverty itself, apart from spiritual conditions, was a sufficient title to the inheritance. There must be the love of God which has its root in faith. What is pressed is that poverty and not wealth was the true object of respect; partly as predisposing men to the spiritual conditions, partly as having been singled out by Christ for special blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">Jam 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀκούσατε</span>, <span class="ital">hearken</span>) By this address he <span class="ital">brings to trial</span> and restrains rash <span class="ital">judges</span>, showing that the presumption ought to be in favour of the poor, rather than the rich.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς</span>, <span class="ital">God</span>) Our judgment ought to be in conformity with the judgment of God, even in ceremonies and outward gestures.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πτωχοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">chose the poor</span>) They who are chosen, are needy. This description does not include all the poor, nor is it confined to the poor only; for poverty and riches of themselves do not render any man good or evil; and yet the poor are in various places pronounced happy in preference to the rich: ch. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>. And the terms, <span class="ital">wicked and rich, righteous and poor</span>, are generally synonymous. <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm" title="And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.">Isaiah 53:9</a>; <a href="/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>. The rich man, if he is good, renounces his riches; the poor man, if he is wicked, neglects that which is the advantage of poverty. Many Christians were of the poor, few from among the rich; especially at Jerusalem, and among those to whom James writes. Comp. the notes on ch. <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a> and following verses. So also, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, <span class="ital">God hath chosen</span>, etc.—<span class="greekheb">πλουσίους ἐν πίστει</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ κληρονόμους</span>, <span class="ital">rich in faith, and heirs</span>) Beza thus explains it: <span class="ital">He chose the poor, that they might become rich in faith, and heirs</span>, etc. E. Schmid thus takes it: <span class="ital">He chose the poor, who are however rich in faith, to be also heirs</span>, etc. The latter puts asunder two points which are most intimately connected, <span class="ital">rich and heirs</span>. The former, contrary to the design of the apostle, places <span class="ital">faith and love</span> after <span class="ital">election</span>. For James treats concerning the order of election, faith, and love, just as that order becomes known to us: and moreover he thus furnishes us with a rule for forming a right judgment respecting the poor; in which point of view not only faith, but also love, precedes election in the order of our knowledge. The meaning of the apostle is this: <span class="ital">God chose the poor, who are rich in faith, and who are also heirs</span>, etc. Whence this argument is derived: “Whoever are rich in faith and heirs, them we ought to acknowledge and treat as chosen by God; but the poor are rich in faith,” etc. Thus election is so far from preceding faith, that even the inheritance precedes election; and if we duly consider the antithesis between <span class="ital">He chose</span>, and <span class="ital">ye have despised</span>, this conclusion presents itself. Both God highly esteems, and we ought to have highly esteemed, those who are rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span>, <span class="ital">in faith</span>) which has for its object the Lord of glory. To this <span class="ital">faith</span> are assigned as a consequence the <span class="ital">riches</span> of heaven and of the world to come, even as the <span class="ital">inheritance</span> is assigned to <span class="ital">love</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κληρονόμους</span>, <span class="ital">heirs</span>) because sons.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς βασιλείας</span>, <span class="ital">of the kingdom</span>) The highest dignity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Proof of the sinfulness of respect of persons.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>).

Faith is not the quality in which they are to be rich, but the sphere or element; rich in their position as believers. "Not the measure of faith, in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the writer's mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which every believer is rich" (Wiesinger, cited by Alford). </body></html>
