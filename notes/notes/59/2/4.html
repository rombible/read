Did you not lose the idea of brotherhood, and become contentious as to supremacy of self and place—serving yourselves while prepared for the service of Christ? The Lord Jesus thought not His equality with God a thing ever to be grasped at, if work for man could be done by self-humiliation. Therefore, although being ‘equal to the Father, as touching His Godhead,’ He became ‘inferior . . . as touching His Manhood.’ And none may turn unmoved from that picture of sublime condescension to the petty strifes of quality and position which profane the Christian sanctuary. Most sadly true is it that in making distinctions such as these between rich and poor, we ‘become of the number of those who doubt respecting their faith;’ for, while it abolishes such altogether in the presence of God, we set them up of our own arrogance and pride. ‘We draw nigh unto Him with our mouth, and honour Him with our lips, but our heart is far from Him; and our worship therefore vain.’” (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm" title="And they come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.">Ezekiel 33:31</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/15-8.htm" title="This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.">Matthew 15:8-9</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are ye not then partial in yourselves? - Among yourselves. Do you not show that you are partial?<p>And are become judges of evil thoughts - There has been considerable difference of opinion respecting this passage, yet the sense seems not to be difficult. There are two ideas in it: one is, that they showed by this conduct that they took it upon themselves to be judges, to pronounce on the character of men who were strangers, and on their claims to respect (Compare <a href="/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>); the other is, that in doing this, they were not guided by just rules, but that they did it under the influence of improper "thoughts." They did it not from benevolence; not from a desire to do justice to all according to their moral character; but from that improper feeling which leads us to show honor to men on account of their external appearance, rather than their real worth. The wrong in the case was in their presuming to "judge" these strangers at all, as they practically did by making this distinction, and then by doing it under the influence of such an unjust rule of judgment. The sense is, that we have no right to form a decisive judgment of men on their first appearance, as we do when we treat one with respect and the other not; and that when we make up our opinion in regard to them, it should be by some other means of judging than the question whether they can wear gold rings, and dress well, or not. Beza and Doddridge render this, "ye become judges who reason ill." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/james/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Are ye not &#8230; partial&#8212;literally, "Have ye not made distinctions" or "differences" (so as to prefer one to another)? So in Jude 22.<p>in yourselves&#8212;in your minds, that is, according to your carnal inclination [Grotius].<p>are become judges of evil thoughts&#8212;The Greek words for "judges" and for "partial," are akin in sound and meaning. A similar translation ought therefore to be given to both. Thus, either for "judges," &c. translate, "distinguishers of (that is, according to your) evil thoughts"; or, do ye not partially judge between men, and are become evilly-thinking judges (Mr 7:21)? The "evil thoughts" are in the judges themselves; as in Lu 18:6, the Greek, "judge of injustice," is translated, "unjust judge." Alford and Wahl translate, "Did ye not doubt" (respecting your faith, which is inconsistent with the distinctions made by you between rich and poor)? For the Greek constantly means "doubt" in all the New Testament. So in Jas 1:6, "wavering." Mt 21:21; Ac 10:20; Ro 4:20, "staggered not." The same play on the same kindred words occurs in the Greek of Ro 14:10, 23, "judge &#8230; doubteth." The same blame of being a judge, when one ought to be an obeyer, of the law is found in Jas 4:11.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/james/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Are ye not then partial in yourselves?</span> Either, are ye not judged in yourselves, convicted by your own consciences of partiality, and accepting men’s persons?

Expositors greatly differ in the explanation of this verse, according as they explain the verb <span class="greekheb">διεκρίθητε</span>, and understand <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> as a pure negation, or as an interrogative particle. It is best to take <span class="greekheb">διεκρίθητε</span>, in form indeed passive, in meaning as the aorist middle, as in <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>, <a href="/mark/11-23.htm" title="For truly I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he said.">Mark 11:23</a>, <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>, and to give to the verb here the same meaning which it has constantly in the usage of the N.

For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a>. But then the sentence must be taken as interrogative: <span class="ital">Did you not then doubt among yourselves? i.e.</span>, Have ye not fallen into a contradiction with your faith (<a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>), according to which external glory and riches are nothing, whilst ye by your conduct have attached a value to them?

James calls them <span class="greekheb">κριταί</span>, because in their conduct they expressed their judgment on the rich and poor. The genitive <span class="greekheb">διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν</span> is not the genitive of object,[113] but of quality. <span class="greekheb">διαλογισμοί</span> is here, as predominantly in the N.

(<span class="ital">a</span>) The verb <span class="ital">active</span>—(<span class="greekheb">α</span>) <span class="ital">interrogative:</span> nonne discrimen fecistis apud vos ipsos? (Laurentius, Grotius, Wolf, Hottinger, Knapp). In this explanation <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐαυτοῖς</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀλλήλοις</span>; Schneckenburger, however, explains <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</span> = in animis vestris; but then the meaning: discrimen facere, would pass into an act of the judgment, “<span class="ital">statuere.</span>” (<span class="greekheb">β</span>) <span class="ital">Negative:</span> “Then partly ye would not have distinguished (according to a sound judgment) among yourselves, and partly also ye would have judged after an evil manner of thinking (thus an error of the understanding and of the heart)” (Grashof).—(<span class="ital">b</span>) The verb <span class="ital">passive:</span> dupliciter peccatis, primo: inter vos ipsos non estis discriminati h. e. cessat piorum et impiorum differentia (Oeder).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> = judicare. (<span class="ital">a</span>) The verb <span class="ital">active</span>—(<span class="greekheb">α</span>) <span class="ital">interrogative:</span> nonne judicastis, deliberastis ipsi? “Are ye not yourselves persuaded how wrong this is?” (Augusti). (<span class="greekheb">β</span>) <span class="ital">Negative:</span> non discrevistis justa dubitatione, considerantia et aestimatione, quid tribuendum esset pauperi potius vel certe non minus, quam diviti (Bengel). Luther combines this rendering with that under James 2 : “And ye do not well consider, but ye become judges, and make an evil distinction.” Here also comes in the explanation of Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">τὸ διακριτικὸν ὑμῶν διφθείρατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">μηδεμίαν συζήτησιν ποιήσαντες πότερον τιμητέον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οὕτως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδιακρίτως</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν προοωποληψίᾳ τὸν μὲν ἐτιμήσατε</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὸν δὲ ἠτιμάσατε</span>.—(<span class="ital">b</span>) The verb <span class="ital">passive</span>—(<span class="greekheb">α</span>) <span class="ital">interrogative:</span> Nonne vos in conscientiis dijudicati h. e. convicti estis?

T. Besides, several require arbitrary completions, and many do not correspond to the context. Brückner, de Wette, and Wiesinger have also here correctly maintained the meaning <span class="ital">to doubt.</span> De Wette: “Have you not then become doubtful in your faith?” Wiesinger: “Have you not forsaken the law of faith, which recognises only one true riches?” With the reading of B (omitting <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>) the thought is the same; the interrogative (<span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>), however, serves for the heightening of the thought, the readers themselves being thereby charged to pronounce the judgment. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> of the <span class="ital">Receptus</span> stands as in <a href="/mark/10-26.htm" title="And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?">Mark 10:26</a>, <a href="/luke/10-29.htm" title="But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?">Luke 10:29</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>, with the question suddenly introduced.

It means accordingly, “<span class="bld">evil-thinking judges</span>.” In acting as they did, men made themselves judges between rich and poor, and with “base reasonings,” or better, perhaps, what we call “base calculations,” gave a preference to the former.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/james/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/james/2-4.htm" title="Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?">Jam 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ οὐ</span>, <span class="ital">nor</span>) <span class="ital">If</span>, of <a href="/james/2-2.htm" title="For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;">Jam 2:2</a>, has its Apodosis in this verse: <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, “<span class="ital">both</span> ye do <span class="ital">not</span> discriminate aright, <span class="ital">and</span>.”—<span class="greekheb">οὐ διακρίθητε</span>) Though you make that difference (<span class="ital">discrimination</span>) between the rich and the poor, “you do <span class="ital">not discriminate</span>” with just hesitation, consideration, and weighing, that which should have been given to the poor man, rather, or at any rate not less, than to the rich. <span class="greekheb">Διεκρίθη</span> occurs in an active sense also in <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διακρίνεσθαι</span> is used in this passage of James in a good sense. [But Engl. Vers. takes it in a bad sense, and with an interrogation, “Are ye not <span class="ital">partial?</span>”] To this compound word the simple <span class="greekheb">κριταὶ</span> is opposed, which word denotes those who <span class="ital">settle</span> any subject definitely. <span class="greekheb">Διάκρισις</span> (discrimination) ought to precede <span class="greekheb">κρίσις</span> (judgment); whereas you omit the former and exercise the latter.—<span class="greekheb">κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν</span>) <span class="ital">judges</span>, approvers <span class="ital">of evil thoughts:</span> that is, of the rich, who have outward splendour, but abound with evil thoughts. They who honour the rich man in preference to the poor, do not expressly desire to approve of his <span class="ital">evil thoughts</span>; but James puts this interpretation upon their conduct, and lays it to their charge, because the rich man in his pomp is full of evil thoughts. The more common sentiment is presupposed as well known.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The copula (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) of the Received Text is certainly spurious.

B also omits the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> (so Westcott and Herr margin). If this manuscript is followed, the sentence must be read as a direct statement, and not as interrogative. But if (with most manuscripts and editions) the interrogative be retained, the translation is still doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> may mean: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Are ye not divided in your own mind?" so the Syriac and R.V., which would imply that this respect of persons showed that they were halting between God and the world - in fact, double-minded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves?" R.V. margin; this gives an excellent sense, but is wanting in authority, as there appears to be no other instance forthcoming of the passive with this meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Did you not doubt among yourselves?" this (doubt) is the almost invariable meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the New Testament, and the word has already been used in this sense by St. James (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>). Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: "It shows <span class="accented">doubt to</span> act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and <span class="accented">wicked reasonings</span> to argue mentally that the poor <span class="accented">must</span> be less worthy of honor than the rich." Judges of evil thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">sc.</span> their own (thoughts), which caused them to respect persons. Thus the phrase is equivalent to "evil-thinking judges." (On the genitive, see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T. Greek,' p. 233; and cf. <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/james/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are ye not partial in yourselves?

The constant sense of the verb in the New Testament is doubt, except <a href="/acts/11-2.htm">Acts 11:2</a>; Jde 1:9, where it means dispute. Compare <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>. The meaning here is, therefore, that, in making a distinction between the rich and the poor, they expressed a doubt concerning the faith which they professed, and which abolished such distinctions. Hence, Rev., rightly, Are ye not divided in your own mind?<p>Judges of evil thoughts (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, as Rev., "judges with evil thoughts."

So <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, a hearer of forgetfulness. The word thoughts is, rather, reasonings. See on deceiving yourselves (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).
