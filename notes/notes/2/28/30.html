The expression used is identical with that employed in <a href="/exodus/25-15.htm" title="The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.">Exodus 25:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a> with respect to putting the Two Tables into the Ark of the Covenant, and can scarcely have any other meaning than the literal placing of one thing inside another. It has been already shown (see Note on <a href="/exodus/28-16.htm" title="Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.">Exodus 28:16</a>) that the breastplate was a bag, and so capable of being used as a receptacle. The words “Urim and Thummim” mean literally, “lights and perfections,” or, if the plural be one of dignity, “light and perfection” (Aquila and Symmachus translate by <span class= "greekheb">φωτισμοὶ καὶ τελειότητεϛ</span>; the LXX., by <span class= "greekheb">ἡ δήλωσιϛ καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια</span>; the Vulg. by doctrina et veritas). The question arises, what do these two words, as here used, designate? Do they designate material objects; if so, what objects? In favour of their designating material objects are (1) the expressions, “thou shalt put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim,” “they shall be upon Aaron’s heart,” “he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim” (<a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>); (2) the fact that the words are accompanied by the article, on this, the first mention of them, as if they were familiar objects, well known at the time to the people generally; and (3) the explanations of Philo and Josephus, which, while they differ in all other respects, agree in this, that material objects are intended. But, if so, what objects? The two sides of the breastplate, says Philo (<span class= "ital">De Monarch., </span>ii. 5). But these were not “put in” the breastplate after it was complete, as implied in <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>. The twelve jewels, says Josephus; but the present passage, taken in conjunction with <a href="/context/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17-21</a>, distinguishes the Urim and Thummim from them. Some small objects which the bag of the breastplate could hold, and with which the people had long been familiar, can alone answer the requirements of the case. Most modern critics are thus far agreed; but when the further question is asked, what were these objects? The greatest difference appears. Diamonds, cut and uncut; slips of metal, marked with “yes” and “no”; lots, of some kind or other; and small images, like the <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>(<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>), are among the suggestions. A very slight examination of the arguments by which these various views are supported is sufficient to show that certainty on the subject is unattainable. Probability, however, seems on the whole to be in favour of a connection between divination by <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>and consultation of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-14.htm" title="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.">Judges 18:14</a>; <a href="/judges/18-17.htm" title="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.">Judges 18:17</a>; <a href="/judges/18-20.htm" title="And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.">Judges 18:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>), whence it is reasonable to conclude that the Urim and Thummim were small images, by which God had been consulted in the past, and by which Moses was now authorised to state that He would be consulted in the future. How the consultation was made, and the decision given, is a question still more obscure than that which has been just considered, and one which seems to the present writer to admit of no solution. The reader who is curious upon the point may be referred to Dean Plumptre’s article on “Urim and Thummim,” in Dr. W. Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>where the views propounded are ingenious, if not altogether satisfactory.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Urim and Thummim — </span>By which the will of God was made known in doubtful cases, was put in this breast-plate, which is therefore called the breast-plate of judgment. <span class="ital">Urim </span>and <span class="ital">Thummim </span>signify <span class="ital">light </span>and <span class="ital">integrity, </span>or lights and perfections: many conjectures there are among the learned what they were: we have no reason to think they were any thing that Moses was to make, more than what was before ordered; so that either God made them himself, and gave them to Moses, for him to put into the breast-plate when other things were prepared; or, as is most probable, no more is meant but a declaration of the further use of what was already ordered to be made. The words may be read thus: <span class="ital">And thou shalt give, </span>or add, <span class="ital">to the breast-plate of judgment, the illuminations and perfections, and they shall be upon the heart of Aaron — </span>That is, he shall be endued with a power of knowing and making known the mind of God in all difficult cases, relative either to the civil or ecclesiastical state. Their government was a theocracy; God was their king, the high-priest was, under God, their ruler, this <span class="ital">Urim </span>and <span class="ital">Thummim </span>were his cabinet council: probably Moses wrote upon the breast-plate, or wove into it, these words, <span class="ital">Urim </span>and <span class="ital">Thummim, </span>to signify that the high-priest, having on him this breast-plate, and asking counsel of God in any emergency, should be directed to those measures which God would own. If he were standing before the ark, probably he received instructions from off the mercy-seat, as Moses did, <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>. If he were at a distance from the ark, as Abiathar was when he inquired of the Lord for David, (<a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1 Samuel 23:6</a>,) then the answer was given either by a voice from heaven, or by an impulse upon the mind of the high-priest, which last is perhaps intimated in that expression, He shall <span class="ital">bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart. </span>This oracle was of great use to Israel. Joshua consulted it, (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>,) and it is likely, the judges after him. It was lost in the captivity, and never retrieved after. Indeed, according to the Jewish doctors, as Calmet observes, the custom of consulting God by <span class="ital">Urim </span>and <span class="ital">Thummim </span>continued no longer than under the tabernacle; for under the first temple, they say, (the temple of Solomon,) God spake by the prophets, and under the second temple, or after the captivity of Babylon, by <span class="ital">bath koll, </span>or the daughter of the voice, by which they mean a voice sent from heaven, as that which was heard at the baptism of Christ, at his transfiguration, and that mentioned <a href="/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This <span class="ital">Urim and Thummim, </span>whatever they were, and in whatever way the will of God was made known by them, were no more than a shadow of good things to come, and the substance is Christ. He is our oracle; by him God in these last days makes known himself and his mind to us. Divine revelation centres in him, and comes to us through him; he is the light, the true light, the faithful witness; and from him we receive the Spirit of truth, who leads us into all truth. The joining of the breast-plate to the ephod signifies, that his prophetical office was founded on his priesthood; and it was by the merit of his death that he purchased this honour for himself, and this favour for us. It was the <span class="ital">Lamb that had been slain </span>that was worthy to <span class="ital">take the book, </span>and to <span class="ital">open the seals, </span><a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:15-30 The chief ornament of the high priest, was the breastplate, a rich piece of cloth, curiously worked. The name of each tribe was graven in a precious stone, fixed in the breastplate, to signify how precious, in God's sight, believers are, and how honourable. How small and poor soever the tribe was, it was as a precious stone in the breastplate of the high priest; thus are all the saints dear to Christ, however men esteem them. The high priest had the names of the tribes, both on his shoulders and on his breast, which reminds us of the power and the love with which our Lord Jesus pleads for those that are his. He not only bears them up in his arms with almighty strength, but he carries them in his bosom with tender affection. What comfort is this to us in all our addresses to God! The Urim and Thummim, by which the will of God was made known in doubtful cases, were put in this breastplate. Urim and Thummim signify light and integrity. There are many conjectures what these were; the most probable opinion seems to be, that they were the twelve precious stones in the high priest's breastplate. Now, Christ is our Oracle. By him God, in these last days, makes known himself and his mind to us, Heb 1:1,2; Joh 1:18. He is the true Light, the faithful Witness, the Truth itself, and from him we receive the Spirit of Truth, who leads into all truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Urim and the Thummim - "The Light and the Truth, or perfection."<p>From the way in which they are spoken of here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>, compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15-21</a>, it would appear that the Urim and the Thummim were some material things, previously existing and familiarly known, that they were separate from the breastplate itself, as well as from the gems that were set upon it, and were kept in the bag of the breastplate <a href="/exodus/28-16.htm">Exodus 28:16</a>.<p>By means of them the will of Yahweh, especially in what related to the wars in which His people were engaged, was made known.

They received the name because the bearing of them qualified the high priest to consult the divine oracle on all public or national emergencies, by going into the holy place&#8212;standing close before the veil and putting his hand upon the Urim and Thummim, he conveyed a petition from the people and asked counsel of God, who, as the Sovereign of Israel, gave response from the midst of His glory. Little, however, is known about them. But it may be remarked that Egyptian judges wore on the breast of their official robes a representation of Justice, and the high priest in Israel long officiated also as a judge; so that some think the Urim and Thummim had a reference to his judicial functions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words <span class="bld">Urim and Thummim</span> confessedly signify <span class="ital">light</span>, or <span class="ital">illuminations and perfections</span>, which may be understood either of two differing things, the one noting the knowledge, the other the perfection, to wit, of virtues and graces, which were required in the high priest, and which were in Christ in an eminent degree, and from him alone communicated to his people; or of one and the same thing, noting perfect light or illumination, by a figure called <span class="ital">hendyadis</span>, oft used in Scripture, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deu 16:18</a> <a href="/matthew/4-16.htm" title="The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.">Matthew 4:16</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/10-21.htm" title="Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;">Job 10:21</a> <a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a> <a href="/acts/17-25.htm" title="Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;">Acts 17:25</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a></span>. Which may seem probable, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the great use of this instrument was to give light and direction in dubious and difficult cases, and not to confer any other perfection upon any person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because sometimes both these words and things are expressed only by one of them, and that is by <span class="ital">Urim</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a> <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1 Samuel 28:6</a></span>, which signifies <span class="ital">lights</span>. And the name seems to be given from the effect, because hence the Israelites had clear light, and perfect or certain direction in dark and doubtful matters. But the great question is, what this Urim and Thummim was, and in what manner God answered by it; which God having on purpose concealed from us, and not set down the matter or form of it, as he hath done of all the other particulars, it may seem curiosity and presumption for men solicitously to inquire, and positively to determine. Many conceive it was nothing else but the twelve precious stones, wherein the names of the twelve tribes were engraven, and that the answer of God was composed out of those letters which either show more brightly, or thrust themselves further outward, than the rest did; which seems a frivolous and ungrounded conjecture, both because all the letters of the alphabet were not there, and so all answers could not be given by them; and because it was shut up within the duplicature of the breastplate, and therefore could not be seen by the high priest; and there is not a word to signify that he was to take it out thence, and look upon it, but rather the contrary is evident. And that this Urim and Thummim are not the same thing with those twelve stones may be easily proved: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the stones were <span class="ital">set and engraven</span> in the breastplate, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17</a>,21</span>, this was only <span class="ital">put</span> into it, which is a word of quite different and more loose and large signification, and therefore probably doth not design the same thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It is not likely that in such a brief account of the sacred utensils the same command would be repeated again, especially in more dark and general words than it was mentioned before. And how could Moses now put it in, when the workmen had fastened it there before? or why should he be required to put it in the breastplate, when it was fastened to it already, and could not without violence be taken from it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because the stones were put in by the workmen, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/39-10.htm" title="And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.">Exodus 39:10</a></span>, the Urim and Thummim by Moses himself, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a></span>. It is objected, that where the stones are mentioned there is no mention of Urim and Thummim, as <span class="bld"> Exo 29</span>, and that where the Urim and Thummim are mentioned there is no mention of the stones, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a></span>, which shows they were one and the same thing. But that is not necessary, and there is an evident reason of both those omissions; of the former, <span class="bld"> Exo 39</span>, because he mentions only those things which were made by the workmen, whereas the Urium and Thummim seems to have been made immediately by God, or by Moses with God’s direction; of the latter, <span class="bld"> Le 8</span>, because the stones are implied in the breastplate as a part of it, and being fastened to it, whereas there he only mentions what was put in by Moses himself. There are other conjectures, as that it; as the name Jehovah, or some visible representations, &c. But such conjectures are as easily denied as affirmed. It is therefore more modest and reasonable to be silent where God is silent, than to indulge ourselves in boundless and groundless fancies. It may suffice us to know that this was a singular piece of Divine workmanship, which the high priest was obliged to wear upon solemn occasions, as one of the conditions upon which God engaged to give him answers; which answers God might give to him either by inward suggestion to his mind, or by a vocal expression to his ear. But which of those ways, or whether by any other way, it is needless now to search, and impossible certainly to discover. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The judgment of the children of Israel</span>.

What these interpreters are at a loss about, both Jewish and Christian; some have confessed their ignorance of them, have conjectured they were only these two words and put in the duplicature of the breastplate; that the name of Jehovah, with other divine were put there and so called; and some have that they were little images, the same with the teraphim, the high priest carried in the folds of breastplate, by which consultation was made; others have thought them to be a work purely divine, of Jehovah's putting there; for my own part I am to follow Josephus (x), who takes them to be the same with the twelve stones; and it is observable that where the stones are mentioned nothing is said of the Urim and Thummim, and where the Urim and Thummim are observed, no notice is taken of the stones, see <a href="/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a> the use of these was to have the names of the children of Israel engraven upon them, and so be borne on the heart of Aaron when he went into the holy place, as is here said of the Urim and Thummim; and that consultation might be made by them in matters of moment and difficulty, as appears from various other passages of the Scripture, <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a> and but in what manner this was done, and in what way the answer was given and understood, are not easily accounted for: some say, by the brightness or protuberance of the letters on the stones; others, by the shining and splendour of the stones, which is more probable; others, by an inward impression on the mind of the priest; and others, by an articulate voice, which seems best of all: the Septuagint render these two words "manifestation and truth"; and Aelianus (y) reports, that the chief and oldest among the Egyptian priests and judges wore an image of a sapphire stone about his neck, which they called "truth": and, according to Diodorus Siculus (z), this image was of more precious stones than one; for he says, the president in the Egyptian courts of judicature had on his neck, hanging on a golden chain, an image of precious stones, which they called truth: but there is no reason to believe that this custom was as ancient as the times of the Israelites in Egypt, or that they borrowed this from them; but rather, that the Egyptians did this in imitation of what the high priest among the Jews wore, which they might learn from the Jews in Solomon's time, or in later ages; the words Urim and Thummim signify "lights and perfections", agreeably to which is the paraphrase of Jonathan;"Urim, which enlighten their words, and manifest the hidden things of the house of Israel, and Thummim, which perfect their works, by the high priest, who seeks instruction from the Lord by them:''they were typical of Christ, in whom all lights and perfections are; all light is in him; the light of nature and reason is from him, as the Creator, and is given to every man that comes into the world; the light of grace is with him, and communicated to all his people at conversion, and in all the after degrees and supplies of it; all light and knowledge in divine things is from him, the knowledge of God, of himself, and of the Gospel, and the truths of it; and the light of glory will be from him: all the perfections of deity, the whole fulness of the Godhead, all human perfections, which make him as man in all things like unto us, but far exceeding us; as Mediator, all the blessings and promises of the covenant are in him; all the gifts of the Spirit, and a fulness of all grace; there are in him perfect righteousness, perfect holiness, all light, life, strength, wisdom, joy, and comfort (a): and these stones, or Urim and Thummim, may be an emblem also of the saints, being made light and perfect righteousness in Christ, from whom they have both: <p>and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the Lord; either into the holy or into the most holy place, just as the names of the children of Israel on the stones are said to be; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29</a>, <p>and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually; not only bear their names and remember their cases, make intercession for them, and represent their persons, in all which he was a type of Christ, but bear their judgment, have that at heart, and administer it unto them; and in all doubtful and difficult cases inquire of God what was fit and right to do for them, or for them to do: so Christ has the government of his people both at heart and in his hands; all judgment is committed to him, and he is the righteousness of his people now, and will be their Judge hereafter. <p>(x) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 7. sect. 5.

And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.">1 Samuel 14:41</a>, presupposed by the LXX. which throws the greatest light upon the manner in which they were used, ‘And Saul said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If the iniquity be in me or in Jonathan my son, <span class="ital">give Urim</span>; and if it be in thy people Israel, <span class="ital">give Thummim</span>. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the people escaped.’ (The Heb. words rendered in RVm. = A.V. ‘Give a perfect (lot)’ are a mutilated fragment of the longer text preserved in LXX., <span class="ital">thâmim</span>, ‘perfect,’ differing from ‘Thummim’ only in vocalization.) The priest who cast the lots on this occasion was evidently Ahijah, who just before (<span class="ital">vv.</span> 3, 18 RVm.) is mentioned as ‘bearing’ (above, p. 313) an ephod; and a comparison of the other passages in 1 Sam. in which the priest asks for a Divine decision with the help of the ephod, makes it probable that on these occasions also the Urim and Thummim, though not actually mentioned, were in fact employed: see <a href="/1_samuel/14-18.htm" title="And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.">1 Samuel 14:18</a> (read as RVm.), 19, 37, <a href="/context/exodus/23-10.htm" title="And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:...">Exodus 23:10-12</a> (see <span class="ital">v.</span> 6), <a href="/context/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it....">Exodus 30:7-8</a>. After David’s time the Urim and Thummim are not mentioned in the history; and though we are naturally not in a position to say that they were never resorted to, yet the increasing importance of the prophets as announcers of the Divine will, and the more spiritual conceptions of God which their teaching brought with it, make it probable that their use fell more and more into abeyance. But the possession of the sacred lots was an ancient and prized prerogative of the priestly caste (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>); the right of using them was doubtless jealously maintained by the chief priest till—through whatever cause—they were lost (<a href="/ezra/2-63.htm" title="And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.">Ezra 2:63</a>); and so they naturally found a place in P’s description of the high priest’s official dress, and their original institution was referred back to Moses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The etymological meaning of ‘Urim and Thummim’ is uncertain. Regarded as two Heb. words, they would naturally signify <span class="ital">Lights and Perfections</span>; but as giving the original sense of the expression, this explanation is anything but satisfactory. It is possible that the words are the Hebraized forms of two originally Babylonian technical terms. The LXX. usually express <span class="ital">Urim</span> by either <span class="greekheb">δῆλοι</span> (sc. <span class="greekheb">λίθοι</span>), i.e. ‘visible, manifest (stones),’—and so in the Greek text of <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/33-3.htm" title="A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle.">Sir 33:3</a> (codd. <span class="greekheb">א</span> A and RV.), <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-10.htm" title="With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work of the embroiderer, with a breastplate of judgment, and with Urim and Thummim;">Sir 45:10</a>,—or <span class="greekheb">δήλωσις</span>, ‘manifestation, declaration’; and <span class="ital">Thummim</span> by <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>, ‘truth’ (cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-10.htm" title="With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work of the embroiderer, with a breastplate of judgment, and with Urim and Thummim;">Sir 45:10</a>): the former rend is a paraphrase of ‘Lights’: the latter—as the translators lived in Egypt—may have been suggested to them by the fact that in Egypt the judge presiding at a trial wore, suspended from his neck, an image of Tme, the Egyptian goddess of truth (Wilk.-B. i. 296, iii. 183 f.; Diod. i. 48, 75).

What exactly the two words represented is doubtful in the extreme. It has been supposed by some that they were not material objects, but a method by which God communicated his will; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, a miraculous light, or a miraculous voice. But such things as these could not have been put by Moses either "in," or "on the breastplate of judgment." Modern critics are generally agreed that the Urim and Thummim must have been material objects of one kind or another. The objects suggested are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The engraved stones of the breast-plate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Two small images, like the <span class="accented">teraphim</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A gold plate, engraved with the name of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Three plates or slips; one blank, one engraved with "yes," and one with "no." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Diamonds, cut and uncut, with marks engraved on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against the first of these views it is urged with very great force that the present passage shows the Urim and Thummim to be something quite distinct from the breast-plate - something which was to be added to the breast-plate after all the stones had been set in it; and which Aaron was to bear upon his breast in addition to the breast-plate and its jewels (compare ver. 29 with ver. 30). Against the fourth and fifth, it is sufficient to observe that they are pure conjectures, without any basis of authority, either in Scripture or tradition. The second and the third remain. The third has important Jewish names in its favour, but is open to the objection that it makes a single object correspond to both words. The second alone seems to have any basis in Scripture, which certainly connects the use of <span class="accented">teraphim</span> with the use of an ephod (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14, 17, 20</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). On the whole, while admitting that there is no sufficient evidence to determine the question, we incline to regard the Urim and Thummim as small images, kept in the bag of the "breast-plate" (ver. 16), by means of which the high priest gave a decision when he was consulted. How the decision was arrived at, is an even more difficult problem than the one which we have attempted to solve. Some suppose the two images to have been used as lots, one giving an affirmative and the other a negative answer. Others imagine, that by gazing attentively upon them, and fixing his thoughts on the qualities which they symbolised - illumination and perfection - the high priest was thrown into an ecstatic state which enabled him to prophesy aright. The notion has even been started, that an angel spoke by their lips, and answered any question that was put to them. The truth seems to be that no theory on the subject can be more than a theory - quite arbitrary and conjectural - neither Scripture nor tradition furnishing any hint on the matter. If we knew how men divined from teraphim (<a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>;  <a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), we might thence obtain some inkling of the truth, since there is much probability in the view, that the teraphim were employed as an unauthorised substitute for the Urim and Thummim. (See <a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 6, 14-20</a>.) But the method of this divination is wholly unknown. It is not however likely to have been a mere casting of lots, which is a very simple process, and requires no images; nor can this explanation of the decision by Urim and Thummim be regarded as having probability m its favour. Perhaps, of all the theories, that which supposes the Urim and Thummim to have been objects gazed at by the high priest until he entered the ecstatic state, is the least objectionable. It must not, however, be considered an essential part of this theory, that the material objects were derived from the religion of Egypt (Plumptre). The objects must have been well known to Moses and to those for whom he wrote; otherwise, they could not have been introduced, without any account of their nature, as," The Urim" and "The Thummim." They had probably been long possessed and consulted by the nation, which was accustomed to believe that it received enlightenment from them. Perhaps they were a sort of teraphim, but unconnected with any idolatrous worship. It is quite conceivable that an old usage, hitherto un-authorised, but not debased by any flagrant corruption, should have been adopted by Divine command into the Mosaic ritual, purified of any evil that attached to it, and consecrated to an important purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:31-35 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To bind the choshen to the ephod there were to be two close, corded chains of pure gold, which are described here in precisely the same manner as in <a href="/exodus/28-14.htm">Exodus 28:14</a>; so that <a href="/exodus/28-22.htm">Exodus 28:22</a> is to be regarded as a simple repetition of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-14.htm">Exodus 28:14</a>, not merely because these chains are only mentioned once in the account of the execution of the work (<a href="/exodus/39-15.htm">Exodus 39:15</a>), but because, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-25.htm">Exodus 28:25</a>, these chains were to be fastened upon the rosettes notice in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-14.htm">Exodus 28:14</a>, exactly like those described in <a href="/exodus/28-13.htm">Exodus 28:13</a>.
