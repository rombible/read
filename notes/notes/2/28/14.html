It was a short coat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. The shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the children of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his people before the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but was woven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The golden bells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, well represent the good profession that the saints make, and the pomegranates the fruit they bring forth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, two chains of pure gold shalt thou make of wreathen work, twisted like cords.

It was short&#8212;reaching from the breast to a little below the loins&#8212;and though destitute of sleeves, retained its position by the support of straps thrown over each shoulder. These straps or braces, connecting the one with the back, the other with the front piece of which the tunic was composed, were united on the shoulder by two onyx stones, serving as buttons, and on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved, and set in golden encasements. The symbolical design of this was, that the high priest, who bore the names along with him in all his ministrations before the Lord, might be kept in remembrance of his duty to plead their cause, and supplicate the accomplishment of the divine promises in their favor. The ephod was fastened by a girdle of the same costly materials, that is, dyed, embroidered, and wrought with threads of gold. It was about a handbreadth wide and wound twice round the upper part of the waist; it fastened in front, the ends hanging down at great length (Re 1:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At the ends</span>, or, <span class="ital">with ends</span>; i.e. not like chains that are fastened about one’s neck or arm, which seem to have no end; but two distinct chains, with two several ends, both hanging downward: compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/28-22.htm" title="And you shall make on the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold.">Exodus 28:22</a></span>.

Jarchi and Rosemuller approve of the rendering of our translators. Geddes, Boothroyd, and Dathe render "chains of equal length." Gesenius, Kalisch, Canon Cook, and others, believe the true meaning to be "wreathed," or "of wreathen work," so that the next clause, "after the manner of a rope," would be simply exegetic. <span class="cmt_word">Of wreathen work</span>. Literally, "after the manner of a rope." Cords of twisted gold wire were frequently used, instead of chains, by the Egyptians. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the girdle of its putting on which (is) upon it, shall be of it, like its work, gold, etc." There was to be a girdle upon the ephod, of the same material and the same artistic work as the ephod, and joined to it, not separated from it. The &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; mentioned along with the ephod cannot mean &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, textura (lxx, Cler., etc.), but is to be traced to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;  equals  &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; to bind, to fasten, and to be understood in the sense of cingulum, a girdle (compare <a href="/exodus/29-5.htm">Exodus 29:5</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a>, "he girded him with the girdle of the ephod"). &#1488;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is no doubt to be derived from &#1488;&#1508;&#1491;, and signifies the putting on of the ephod. In <a href="/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a> it is applied to the covering of a statue; at the same time, this does not warrant us in attributing to the verb, as used in <a href="/exodus/9-5.htm">Exodus 9:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a>, the meaning, to put on or clothe. This girdle, by which the two parts of the ephod were fastened tightly to the body, so as not to hang loose, was attached to the lower part or extremity of the ephod, so that it was fastened round the body below the breastplate (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-27.htm">Exodus 28:27</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-28.htm">Exodus 28:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-20.htm">Exodus 39:20-21</a>).</body></html>
