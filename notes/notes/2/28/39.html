THE INNER TUNIC OR “COAT.”</span><p>(39) The garments hitherto described have been the outer garments. To these are now added the inner ones, of which there was but little to be said. They consisted of linen drawers (<a href="/context/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42-43</a>), a linen tunic or shirt, woven in a peculiar way, and, to confine the tunic, a girdle, which was to be of many colours (<a href="/exodus/39-29.htm" title="And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:29</a>), and ornamented with embroidery.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt embroider.</span>—It is generally agreed that this is a wrong rendering. Kalisch translates, “thou shalt weave.” Gesenius, “thou shalt work in chequer.” Canon Cook, “thou shalt weave in diaper work.” The word used, which is a rare one, probably designates some peculiar kind of weaving.<p><span class= "bld">The coat.</span>—“Coat” is an unfortunate translation. The <span class= "ital">ketôneth </span>(comp. Gr. <span class= "greekheb">χιτών</span>) was a long white linen tunic or shirt, having tight-fitting sleeves, and reaching nearly to the feet. The sleeves must certainly have shown, as they were the only covering of the priest’s arms; and the lower part of the tunic probably showed below the “robe of the ephod.”<p><span class= "bld">6. THE INNER GIRDLE.</span><p>It appears from <a href="/exodus/39-29.htm" title="And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:29</a> that the girdle was to be “of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,” like the ephod (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6</a>). It was not, however, to be woven of these colours, but to have them worked into it with the needle. As it was worn immediately above the tunic and underneath the robe of the ephod (<a href="/leviticus/8-7.htm" title="And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.">Leviticus 8:7</a>), little, if any, of it could have been seen. Perhaps, however, the ends may have depended below the robe of the ephod.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a></span>.

Aaron must minister in the garments appointed. We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserve to die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with Holiness to the Lord. Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, and that his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear in their forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must be engraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not painted so as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness to the Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgiven to us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The coat of fine linen - A long tunic, or cassock. Josephus says that it was worn next the skin, that it reached to the feet, and that it had closely fitting sleeves. The verb translated "embroider" appears rather to mean weave in diaper work.

Which was a distinct garment from the ephod, and from the robe of the ephod, and was the innermost of all; it was made of fine linen, curiously wrought in the weaving of it: according to some, it was full of a sort of eyelet holes; but as the word is that, from whence comes that for ouches, <a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>. Jarchi thinks it was full of holes, like those ouches or sockets, in which the stones were set; and so this coat was decked and adorned with gems and precious stones stuck in those holes or ouches: but rather it was figured with such little cornered holes as are in the stomach of animals that chew the cud, called the "reticulum"; being in the form of network, as Maimonides (i) observes, and which is approved by Braunius (k): this was an emblem of the righteousness of Christ, comparable to fine linen richly embroidered, decked and adorned with jewels, and curiously wrought, see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, <p>and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen: which was a wrap of linen sixteen cubits long, as Maimonides (l) says, both for the high priest, and for common priests, which only differed in the manner of wrapping them; that for the high priest was wrapped fold upon fold, as a roller for a plaster, and so the mitre was flat upon the head, and was like a turban, and did not rise up into a point; but those of the common priests were so wrapped, as that they arose up like a night cap, or a high crowned hat. The mitre, hat, or cap, though a token of honour, yet also of servitude; and may denote, that the people of the Jews were in a state of servitude, and point at the obscurity and darkness of that dispensation; they not clearly discerning divine mysteries, and wanting boldness and freedom to look up to God; or it may denote that the priests under the law were servants, and that Christ, our great High Priest, should appear in the form of one; and may also point at the intenseness of the mind in them and him on business, being deaf to everything else. The Targum of Jonathan says, the coat of fine linen was to atone for the shedding of innocent blood, and the mitre to atone for those who have elated thoughts, are puffed up with pride and vain conceit: <p>and thou shall make the girdle of needlework; to gird about the embroidered coat, which Josephus (m) says was four fingers broad; but, according to Maimonides (n), it was about three fingers broad, and thirty two cubits long, which they wound about and about; and though we translate it "needlework", it should rather be the "work of the embroiderer", as Ainsworth renders it: and this was not wrought by the needle, but in weaving; for, as Maimonides (o) observes,"they did not make any of the priests' garments with needlework, but the work of the weaver, according to <a href="/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>.''This girdle may denote the strength, readiness, faithfulness, and integrity of Christ in the performance of his priestly office; see <a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>. <p>(i) Cele Hamikdash, c. 8. sect. 16.

Ges. <span class="ital">Thes.</span> 1356; Kennedy, <span class="ital">EB.</span> iv. 5288). The tunic was only the ‘work of the (ordinary) weaver’ (<a href="/exodus/39-27.htm" title="And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,">Exodus 39:27</a>), which was not as elaborate as the two other kinds described on <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a>; but it was something more than perfectly plain weaving.

From the outer garments, which were the most important and distinctive, a transition is now made to the inner ones, in which there was nothing very remarkable. The linen drawers are for the present omitted, as not peculiar to the high priest. Directions are given for the tunic and the girdle. The former is to be woven in some peculiar way - so as to be diapered, as some think - and the latter is to be "the work of the embroiderer." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt embroider</span>.

The girdle was worn directly over the linen shirt, and under "the robe of the ephod." It would seem that it was not seen at all, unless its ends hung down below "the robe of the ephod."
