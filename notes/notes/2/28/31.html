THE ROBE OF THE EPHOD.</span><p>(31-35) The “robe of the ephod” was a frock or tunic, reaching from the neck to below the knees. It was put on over the head, for which a hole was left (<a href="/exodus/28-32.htm" title="And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the middle thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.">Exodus 28:32</a>). Josephus says that it had no sleeves; and it would seem that the upper portion, above the waist, was wholly, or almost wholly, concealed by the ephod and breastplate; but the lower portion, from the waist downwards, formed the outer dress of the high priest, and was conspicuous. The plain blue contrasted well with the variegated ephod and the sparkling breastplate. The robe had no ornament excepting round the bottom, where it was fringed with alternate bells and pomegranates. The pomegranates were a decoration, and nothing more; but the bells served a purpose, which is explained in <a href="/exodus/28-35.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.">Exodus 28:35</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">The robe of the ephod — </span>This was next under the <span class="ital">ephod, </span>and reached down to the knees, without sleeves, and was put on over the head, having holes on the sides to put the arms through, or, as Maimonides describes it, was not sewed together on the sides at all. The hole on the top, through which the head was put, was carefully bound about that it might not tear in the putting on. The bells gave notice to the people in the outer court when he went into the holy place to burn incense, that they might then apply themselves to their devotions at the same time, (<a href="/luke/1-10.htm" title="And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.">Luke 1:10</a>,) in token of their concurrence with him, and their hopes of the ascent of their prayers to God in the virtue of the incense he offered.

Aaron must minister in the garments appointed. We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserve to die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with Holiness to the Lord. Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, and that his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear in their forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must be engraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not painted so as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness to the Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgiven to us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The robe of the ephod - <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22-26</a>. A frock or robe of the simplest form, woven without seam, wholly of blue. It was put on by being drawn over the head. It appears to have had no sleeves. It probably reached a little below the knees.

It had a hole through which the head was thrust, and was formed carefully of one piece, such as was the robe of Christ (Joh 19:23). The high priest's was of a sky-blue color. The binding at the neck was strongly woven, and it terminated below in a fringe, made of blue, purple, and scarlet tassels, in the form of a pomegranate, interspersed with small bells of gold, which tinkled as the wearer was in motion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not the ephod itself, for that was prescribed before, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6</a></span>, but a long and loose robe called the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">robe of the ephod</span>, because it was worn next under it, and was girded about the high priest’s body with the curious girdle of the ephod. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
