Eaten bread must not be forgotten. God's miracles and mercies are to be had in remembrance. The word of God is the manna by which our souls are nourished, Mt 4:4. The comforts of the Spirit are hidden manna, Re 2:17. These come from heaven, as the manna did, and are the support and comfort of the Divine life in the soul, while we are in the wilderness of this world. Christ in the word is to be applied to the soul, and the means of grace are to be used. We must every one of us gather for ourselves, and gather in the morning of our days, the morning of our opportunities; which if we let slip, it may be too late to gather. The manna must not be hoarded up, but eaten; those who have received Christ, must by faith live upon him, and not receive his grace in vain. There was manna enough for all, enough for each, and none had too much; so in Christ there is enough, but not more than we need. But those who ate manna, hungered again, died at last, and with many of them God was not well pleased; whereas they that feed on Christ by faith, shall never hunger, and shall die no more, and with them God will be for ever well pleased. Let us seek earnestly for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to turn all our knowledge of the doctrine of Christ crucified, into the spiritual nourishment of our souls by faith and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Did eat manna forty years - This does not necessarily imply that the Israelites were fed exclusively on manna, or that the supply was continuous during forty years: but that whenever it might be needed, owing to the total or partial failure of other food, it was given until they entered the promised land. They had numerous flocks and herds, which were not slaughtered (see <a href="/numbers/11-22.htm">Numbers 11:22</a>), but which gave them milk, cheese and of course a limited supply of flesh: nor is there any reason to suppose that during a considerable part of that time they may not have cultivated some spots of fertile ground in the wilderness. We may assume, as in most cases of miracle, that the supernatural supply was commensurate with their actual necessity. The manna was not withheld in fact until the Israelites had passed the Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32-36.

Frequent mention being made of this measure in the above relation, as containing the quantity of each man's share of the manna daily, during the forty years' stay in the wilderness; an account is given by the historian how much it contained, by which it may appear what a sufficient provision was made: an ephah, according to Jarchi, contained three seahs (or pecks); a scab, six kabs; a kab, four logs; a log, six egg shells; and the tenth part of an ephah was forty three egg shells, and the fifth part of one: but Dr. Cumberland (b) has reduced this to our measure, and has given it more clearly and distinctly; an ephah, according to him, contained, in wine measure, seven gallons, two quarts, and about half a pint; in corn measure, six gallons, three pints, and three solid inches; and an omer three quarts; which being made into bread, must be more than any ordinary man could well eat; for, as Ainsworth observes, an omer was twice as much as the choenix, (a measure mentioned in <a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>.) which was wont to be a man's allowance of bread corn for a day; and what a vast quantity must fall every day to supply so large a number of people with such a measure; some have reckoned it at 94,466 bushels every day, and that there must be consumed in forty years 1,379,203,600 bushels (c). <p>(b) Of Scripture Weights and Measures, ch. 3. p. 64, 86, 87. ch. 4. p. 137.

An explanatory note: cf. on <span class="ital">v.</span> 16.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The manna of the Peninsula of Sinai is the sweet juice of the <span class="ital">Ṭarfa</span>, a species of Tamarisk. It exudes in summer by night from the trunk and branches, and forms small round white grains, which (as observed by Seetzen in 1809) partly adhere to the twigs of the trees, and partly drop to the ground: in the early morning it is of the consistency of wax, but the sun’s rays soon melt it (cf. <span class="ital">v.</span> 21, above), and later in the day it disappears, being absorbed in the earth. A fresh supply appears each night during its season (June and July). The Arabs gather it in the early morning, boil it down, strain it through coarse stuff, and keep it in leather skins: they ‘pour it like honey over their unleavened bread; its taste is agreeable, somewhat aromatic, and as sweet as honey’ (Burckh., p. 600). In a cool place it keeps for long: the monks of the Sinai monastery store samples of it, which they sell or give to travellers and pilgrims (Rob. i. 115; Ebers, p. 225), as their predecessors did, 13 centuries ago, to Antoninus (<span class="ital">Itin.</span> § 39). According to Ehrenberg (Rob. i. 590) it is produced by the puncture of an insect (now called <span class="ital">Gossyparia mannifera</span>). It softens in the heat of the hand, and consists almost entirely of sugar; so it cannot be ‘ground,’ or made into ‘cakes’ (<a href="/numbers/11-8.htm" title="And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.">Numbers 11:8</a>). It is not found in all parts of the Peninsula; W. Gharandel, W. Ṭaiyibeh, W. Feiran, W. Sheikh (leading round on the N. from J. Serbâl to J. Mûsâ: see on <a href="/exodus/19-1.htm" title="In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.">Exodus 19:1</a>), and W. Naṣb (8–10 miles SE. of J. Mûsâ), are named as parts in which it is abundant. It is found only after a rainy spring, and hence frequently fails altogether. The quantity yielded by the Peninsula in modern times is small—according to Burckhardt (in 1816), 500–600 pounds annually1[156].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[156] See further Knob. <span class="ital">ap.</span> Di., and McLean in <span class="ital">EB.</span>, from whom the above particulars are mostly taken; also Ebers, p. 224 ff. The note in the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Comm.</span> p. 321a is translated almost verbally from Knob, without acknowledgement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The manna described in the Pentateuch thus <span class="ital">resembles</span> the manna produced naturally in the Peninsula, in, approximately, the place (El Markhâ, between Wâdy Ṭaiyibeh and Wâdy Feiran,—if this was really the ‘wilderness of Sin’) of at least its <span class="ital">first</span> appearance; in colour, appearance, and taste (<span class="ital">vv.</span> 14, 31, <a href="/numbers/11-8.htm" title="And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.">Numbers 11:8</a>); in being found and gathered in the early morning; in melting in the sun; and in being called by the same name which is still used in Arabic: it <span class="ital">differs</span> from it in being represented as found not under the tamarisk trees, but on the surface of the wilderness generally, after the disappearance of the dew; as falling in sufficient quantity to feed daily an immense multitude of people; as adjusting itself automatically to the household needs of each person who gathered it; as not falling on the sabbath, the needs of that day being supplied by a double amount being provided on the previous day; as being not confined to wet years, or to the districts on the W. of the Peninsula, but as lasting, apparently continuously, for forty years, throughout the whole journeyings of the Israelites to the border of Canaan; as being capable of being ‘ground’ and made into ‘cakes,’ like meal; and as putrefying if kept (except on the 6th day of the week) till the next morning. It is evident that the Biblical manna, while on the one hand (like the Plagues) it has definite points of contact with a natural phaenomenon or product of the country, differs from the natural manna in the many praeternatural or miraculous features attributed to it. According to Dillmann, ‘the intention of the story (<span class="ital">Sage</span>) followed by the writer was to explain how the Hebrews, during their long journey through the wilderness, where there is no corn, obtained their most important means of life. The question was solved by the supposition that God, in His infinite power, had sent them bread from heaven, in the shape of manna, which was of such a nature that it could be used as earthly corn.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The narrative is to be taken as a signal and beautiful symbolical illustration of the great truth of God’s <span class="ital">ever-sustaining providence</span>: He supplies His people with food, He cares for them in their needs, and He makes the food which He gives them the vehicle of spiritual lessons. The writer of Deuteronomy (<a href="/exodus/8-3.htm" title="And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:">Exodus 8:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:16</a> f.) points to the manna as illustrating the discipline of the wilderness; Israel was ‘humbled’ by being suffered to feel a want, and then by its being taught how, for its relief, and for its own very existence, it was dependent upon the (creative) word of God; it was further ‘proved,’ by the opportunity thus afforded it of shewing whether or not it would accommodate itself, trustfully and contentedly (contrast <a href="/numbers/11-6.htm" title="But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.">Numbers 11:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-5.htm" title="And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.">Numbers 21:5</a>), to this state of continued dependence upon an ordinance of God. In St John (<a href="/john/6-31.htm" title="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.">John 6:31</a> ff.), our Lord, after the reference made by the Jews to the manna eaten by the fathers in the wilderness, uses imagery suggested by the manna to denote Himself as the ‘bread of life,’ which ‘cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.’ For other later allusions, see <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/16-20.htm" title="Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels' food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste.">Wis 16:20</a> (with the last words here, ‘agreeing to every taste,’ of. the Rabb. legend that the manna adapted itself to the taste of every individual, tasting like what he himself desired it to be: set <span class="ital">Jewish Encycl</span>. s.v.), <a href="/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;">1 Corinthians 10:3</a> (<span class="greekheb">πνευματικὸν βρῶμα</span>); and Taylor, <span class="ital">Sayings of the Jewish Fathers</span>, ed. 2, p. 178 f.
