If God had only showed Moses a fountain of water in the wilderness, as he did to Hagar, not far from hence, (<a href="/genesis/21-19.htm" title="And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.">Genesis 21:19</a>,) that had been a great favour; but that he might show his power as well as his pity, and make it a <span class="ital">miracle of mercy, </span>he gave them <span class="ital">water out of a rock. </span>He directed Moses whither to go, appointed him to take of the <span class="ital">elders of Israel with him, </span>to be witnesses of what was done, ordered him to <span class="ital">smite the rock, </span>which he did, and immediately water came out of it in great abundance, which ran throughout the camp in <span class="ital">streams and rivers, </span><a href="/context/psalms/78-15.htm" title="He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths....">Psalm 78:15-16</a>.

It is probable that the people digged canals for the conveyance of it, and pools for the reception of it.

These flow from Christ. And nothing will supply the needs and satisfy the desires of a soul but water out of this rock. A new name was, upon this occasion, given to the place, preserving the remembrance of their murmuring; <span class="ital">Massah — Temptation, </span>because they tempted God; <span class="ital">Meribah — Strife, </span>because they chid with Moses. Several commentators have here quoted the following passage from Shaw’s Travels, as a wonderful confirmation of this great miracle: “Here (in the plain of Rephidim) we still see that extraordinary antiquity, the rock of Meribah, which hath continued down to this day, without the least injury from time or accident. It is a block of granite marble, about six yards square, lying tottering as it were, and loose in the middle of the valley, and seems to have formerly belonged to mount Sinai, which hangs in a variety of precipices all over this plain. <span class="ital">The waters which gushed out, and the stream which followed, </span>(<a href="/psalms/78-20.htm" title="Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?">Psalm 78:20</a>,) have hollowed, across one corner of this rock, a channel about two inches deep and twenty wide, appearing to be incrustated all over, like the inside of a teakettle that had been long in use. Besides several mossy productions that are still preserved by the dew, we see all over the channel a great number of holes, some of them four or five inches deep, and one or two in diameter, the lively and demonstrative tokens of their having been formerly so many fountains. It likewise may be further observed, that art or chance could by no means be concerned in the contrivance; for every circumstance points out to us a miracle; and, in the same manner with the rent in the rock of mount Calvary, at Jerusalem, never fails to produce a religious surprise in all who see it. The Arabs, who were our guard, were ready to stone me for attempting to break off a corner of it.” — Shaw’s <span class="ital">Travels, </span>pp. 252, 253.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 The children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of the Lord, led by the pillar of cloud and fire, yet they came to a place where there was no water for them to drink. We may be in the way of duty, yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into, for the trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief. They began to question whether God was with them or not. This is called their tempting God, which signifies distrust of him after they had received such proofs of his power and goodness. Moses mildly answered them. It is folly to answer passion with passion; that makes bad worse. God graciously appeared to help them. How wonderful the patience and forbearance of God toward provoking sinners! That he might show his power as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave them water out of a rock. God can open fountains for us where we least expect them. Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, may trust him to provide for them. Also, let this direct us to depend on Christ's grace. The apostle says, that Rock was Christ, 1Co 10:4, it was a type of him. While the curse of God might justly have been executed upon our guilty souls, behold the Son of God is smitten for us. Let us ask and receive. There was a constant, abundant supply of this water. Numerous as believers are, the supply of the Spirit of Christ is enough for all. The water flowed from the rock in streams to refresh the wilderness, and attended them on their way towards Canaan; and this water flows from Christ, through the ordinances, in the barren wilderness of this world, to refresh our souls, until we come to glory. A new name was given to the place, in remembrance, not of the mercy of their supply, but of the sin of their murmuring: Massah, Temptation, because they tempted God; Meribah, Strife, because they chid with Moses.

The cloud rested on a particular rock, just as the star rested on the house where the infant Saviour was lodged [Mt 2:9]. And from the rod-smitten rock there forthwith gushed a current of pure and refreshing water. It was perhaps the greatest miracle performed by Moses, and in many respects bore a resemblance to the greatest of Christ's: being done without ostentation and in the presence of a few chosen witnesses (1Co 10:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take with thee of the elders of Israel, </span> that they may be eye-witnesses of this glorious work, and may report it to the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The river; </span> either the Red Sea, for an arm of the sea is sometimes called a river; or the river Nilus. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses,....

These were taken, because they were the principal men among the people, who, as they were men of years, so of prudence and probity, and whose veracity might be depended upon; and since so great a multitude could not all of them see the miracle, the rock being smote, and the water only flowing in one part of it, and perhaps the road to it but narrow, it was proper some persons should be singled out as witnesses of it, and who so proper as the elders of the people? <p>and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand and go; wherewith the river Nile was smitten, and the water became blood, when Moses and Aaron first went to Pharaoh; and which, though smitten by Aaron, yet being with the rod of Moses, and by his order, is attributed to him; or else with which the Red sea was smitten by Moses, and divided; which being but a narrow channel, or an arm of the sea, might be called a river: and this circumstance is observed, as the afore mentioned writer thinks, to let the Israelites know, that the rod was not, as they thought, only designed for inflicting punishment, as on Pharaoh and the Egyptians, but also for bringing good unto them; and when they saw this in his hand, by which so many miracles had been wrought, they might be encouraged to hope that something was going to be done in their favour, and that water would be produced for them to drink. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the elders</span>] to witness what takes place, and be able to certify it to the people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy rod</span>, &c.] see <a href="/exodus/7-17.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.">Exodus 7:17</a> b, 20b.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the river</span>] the <span class="bld">Nile</span>: see on <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm" title="And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.">Exodus 1:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> <span class="cmt_word">on before the people.</span> "Leave the people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "where they are, in Rephidim, and go on in front of them, with some of the elders as witnesses, that the miracle may be sufficiently attested."
