Also to convince them of their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgment before God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discovers what he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns the nature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy. Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is the rule of his obedience and faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Touch it - Rather "touch him."

The Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come &#8230; in a thick cloud, &c.&#8212;The deepest impressions are made on the mind through the medium of the senses; and so He who knew what was in man signalized His descent at the inauguration of the ancient church, by all the sensible tokens of august majesty that were fitted to produce the conviction that He is the great and terrible God. The whole multitude must have anticipated the event with feelings of intense solemnity and awe. The extraordinary preparations enjoined, the ablutions and rigid abstinence they were required to observe, the barriers erected all round the base of the mount, and the stern penalties annexed to the breach of any of the conditions, all tended to create an earnest and solemn expectation which increased as the appointed day drew near.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Abstain from the use of the marriage-bed, partly because your wives may haply have their uncleanness upon them, though unknown to themselves, at least to you, whereby you may be legally defiled; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm" title="The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:18</a></span>; and partly that your minds may be abstracted from all sensual delights, and wholly employed about this great and holy work and service.

A similar obligation lay on the Egyptian priests (Porphyr. <span class="accented">De Abstin</span>. 4:7); and the idea which underlies it was widespread in the ancient world (See Herod. 1:198; Hesiod. <span class="accented">Op. et Di</span>. 733-4; Tibul. <span class="accented">Carm</span>. 2:1; 51:11, 12.) The subject is well treated, from a Christian point of view, by Pope Gregory the First, in his answers to S. Augustine's questions (Bode, <span class="accented">Hist</span>. <span class="accented">Eccl</span>. 2.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 19:16-20 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses communicated to the people through their elders this incomparable promise of the Lord, they promised unanimously (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;) to do all that Jehovah said; and when Moses reported to the Lord what the people had answered, He said to Moses, "I will come to thee in the darkness of the cloud, that the people may listen to My speaking to thee (&#1489;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>, etc.), and also believe thee for ever." As God knew the weakness of the sinful nation, and could not, as the Holy One, come into direct intercourse with it on account of its unholiness, but was about to conclude the covenant with it through the mediation of Moses, it was necessary, in order to accomplish the design of God, that the chosen mediator should receive special credentials; and these were to consists in the fact that Jehovah spoke to Moses in the sight and hearing of the people, that is to say, that He solemnly proclaimed the fundamental law of the covenant in the presence of the whole nation (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-20:18</a>), and showed by this fact that Moses was the recipient and mediator of the revelation of God, in order that the people might believe him "for ever," as the law was to possess everlasting validity (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). </body></html>
