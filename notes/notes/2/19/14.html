Also to convince them of their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgment before God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discovers what he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns the nature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy. Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is the rule of his obedience and faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Touch it - Rather "touch him."

The Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come &#8230; in a thick cloud, &c.&#8212;The deepest impressions are made on the mind through the medium of the senses; and so He who knew what was in man signalized His descent at the inauguration of the ancient church, by all the sensible tokens of august majesty that were fitted to produce the conviction that He is the great and terrible God. The whole multitude must have anticipated the event with feelings of intense solemnity and awe. The extraordinary preparations enjoined, the ablutions and rigid abstinence they were required to observe, the barriers erected all round the base of the mount, and the stern penalties annexed to the breach of any of the conditions, all tended to create an earnest and solemn expectation which increased as the appointed day drew near.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Moses sanctified the people, </span> by commanding them to sanctify themselves, and directing them how to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses went down from the mount unto the people,....

As God knew the weakness of the sinful nation, and could not, as the Holy One, come into direct intercourse with it on account of its unholiness, but was about to conclude the covenant with it through the mediation of Moses, it was necessary, in order to accomplish the design of God, that the chosen mediator should receive special credentials; and these were to consists in the fact that Jehovah spoke to Moses in the sight and hearing of the people, that is to say, that He solemnly proclaimed the fundamental law of the covenant in the presence of the whole nation (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-20:18</a>), and showed by this fact that Moses was the recipient and mediator of the revelation of God, in order that the people might believe him "for ever," as the law was to possess everlasting validity (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). </body></html>
