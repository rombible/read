We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12.

When an animal was killed by a wild beast, the keeper had to produce the mangled carcass, not only in proof of the fact, but to show that he had, by his vigilance and courage, deprived the wild beast of its prey. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

By some wild beast, at least as pretended: <p>then let him bring it for witness; part of that which is torn, that it may be witness for him that it was torn, as in <a href="/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a> as Aben Ezra observes; and so the Jerusalem Targurn,"let him bring of the members of it a witness,''which would make it a clear case that it had been so used; but it is possible that the whole carcass might be carried off, and nothing remain to be brought as a proof of it; wherefore the Targum of Jonathan is,"let him bring witnesses;''and so some versions render it (z); and to this agrees Jarchi, whose note is,"let him bring witnesses of its being torn by violence, and he is free,''such who saw it done; but it is before supposed, that such cattle may be hurt, broken, or maimed, no man seeing it, <a href="/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10</a> and therefore in such a case no witnesses could be brought, wherefore the first sense seems best: <p>and he shall not make good that which was torn; or shall not pay for it, pay the price of it, as much as it is worth. Here Jarchi distinguishes,"there is that which is torn, for which a man pays, and there is that which is torn, for which he does not pay; that which is torn by a cat, or a fox, or a marten (a kind of weasel), he pays for, but that which is torn by a wolf, a lion, or a bear, he does not pay for:''the reason of which is, because it is thought the keeper might have preserved and delivered from the former, and therefore was culpable, when it was not in his power to save from the latter; and the Misnic doctors observe, that one wolf is not violence, but two are; so that what is torn by one, the keeper is bound to pay for, but not what is torn by more. But two dogs are not violence, unless they come from two different quarters, and then they are: a single thief is violence, and so is a lion, a bear, a leopard, a basilisk, and a serpent, and this only when they come willingly, and of themselves; but if they (the cattle) are brought to places where there are troops of wild beasts, and thieves, it is no violence (a), and in such a case the keepers are liable to pay; and so unless he makes use of staves, and calls in other shepherds to his assistance, as Maimonides (b) observes, when it is in his power to do it; and so at least might make an attempt to save or rescue the cattle. <p>(z)  "adducet eum testem", Pagninus, Montanus; "adducat ille testem", Munster, Fagius.

If the animal be torn by wild beasts, the man entrusted with it has only to produce its torn flesh as evidence of the fact, and he need make no compensation. No reasonable precautions could guard against this most common misfortune to cattle in the East (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-39.htm" title="That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.">Genesis 31:39</a>); and the fact that the remains of the flesh could be produced would show that the shepherd had been watchful, and had even driven off the wild beast before it had completely consumed the carcase (<a href="/1_samuel/17-35.htm" title="And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.">1 Samuel 17:35</a>, <a href="/amos/3-12.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.">Amos 3:12</a>).

A similar proviso is found in the laws of the Gentoos (Rosenmuller, <span class="accented">Orient</span>. vol. 1. p. 148). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 22:14, 15 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In cases of dishonesty, or the loss of property entrusted, the following was to be the recognised right: If money or articles (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, not merely tools and furniture, but clothes and ornaments, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>) given to a neighbour to keep should be stolen out of his house, the thief was to restore double if he could be found; but if he could not be discovered, the master of the house was to go before the judicial court (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;, see <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; to draw near to), to see "whether he has not stretched out his hand to his neighbour's goods." &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;: lit., employment, then something earned by employment, a possession. Before the judicial court he was to cleanse himself of the suspicion of having fraudulently appropriated what had been entrusted to him; and in most cases this could probably be only done by an oath of purification. The Sept. and Vulg. both point to this by interpolating &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, et jurabit ("and he shall swear"), though we are not warranted in supplying &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; in consequence. For, apart from the fact that &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is not to be regarded as a particle of adjuration here, as Rosenmller supposes, since this particle signifies "truly" when employed in an oath, and therefore would make the declaration affirmative, whereas the oath was unquestionably to be taken as a release from the suspicion of fraudulent appropriation, and in case of confession an oath was not requisite at all; - apart from all this, if the lawgiver had intended to prescribe an oath for such a case, he would have introduced it here, just as he has done in <a href="/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>. If the man could free himself before the court from the suspicion of unfaithfulness, he would of course not have to make compensation for what was lost, but the owner would have to bear the damage. This legal process is still further extended in <a href="/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a> : &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, "upon every matter of trespass" (by which we are to understand, according to the context, unfaithfulness with regard to, or unjust appropriation of, the property of another man, not only when it had been entrusted, but also if it had been found), "for ox, for ass, etc., or for any manner of lost thing, of which one says that it is this ("this," viz., the matter of trespass), the cause of both (the parties contending about the right of possession) shall come to the judicial court; and he whom the court (Elohim) shall pronounce guilty (of unjust appropriation) shall give double compensation to his neighbour: only double as in <a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>, not four or fivefold as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>, because the object in dispute had not been consumed. </body></html>
