We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The law regarding pledges is expanded, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27.

The suffix in &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="/exodus/22-23.htm">Exodus 22:23</a>) refers to both &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, according to the rule that when there are two or more subjects of different genders, the masculine is employed (Ges. 148, 2). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1488;&#1501; expresses a strong assurance: "yea, if he cries to Me, I will hearken to him" (see Ewald, 330b). "Killing with the sword" points to wars, in which men and fathers of families perish, and their wives and children are made widows and orphans. </body></html>
