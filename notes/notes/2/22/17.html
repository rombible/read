We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12.

This case differs from the previous one, not only in the fact that the animal had either become useless to the owner or was altogether lost, but also in the fact that the keeper, if his statement were true, had not been at all to blame in the matter. The only way in which this could be decided, if there was &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., no other eye-witness present than the keeper himself at the time when the fact occurred, was by the keeper taking an oath before Jehovah, that is to say, before the judicial court. And if he took the oath, the master (owner) of it (the animal that had perished, or been lost or injured) was to accept (sc., the oath), and he (the accused) was not to make reparation. "But if it had been stolen &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; from with him (i.e., from his house or stable), he was to make it good," because he might have prevented this with proper care (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>). On the other hand, if it had been torn in pieces (viz., by a beast of prey, while it was out at grass), he was not to make any compensation, but only to furnish a proof that he had not been wanting in proper care. &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; "let him bring it as a witness," viz., the animal that had been torn in pieces, or a portion of it, from which it might be seen that he had chased the wild beast to recover its prey (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>; <a href="/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>). </body></html>
