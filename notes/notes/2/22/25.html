He that does these things shall never be moved.">Psalm 15:5</a> (as what the model Israelite would not do). The same feeling against taking interest on money lent was entertained by Greek thinkers (see Plato, <span class="ital">Legg.</span> v. 742; Arist. <span class="ital">Polit.</span> i. 10. 5): it was also shared largely in the early Christian Church. Many good Christians, however, now put out their money on interest: what, then, is the cause of the change of feeling? The cause is to be found in the different purpose for which money is now lent. In modern times money is commonly lent for <span class="ital">commercial</span> purposes, to enable the borrower to increase his capital and develope his business: and it is as natural and proper that a reasonable payment should be made for the accommodation, as that it should be made for this loan (i.e. the hire) of a house, or any other commodity. But this use of loans is a modern development: in ancient times money was commonly lent for the relief of poverty brought about by misfortune or debt; it partook thus of the nature of a <span class="ital">charity</span>; and to take interest on money thus lent was felt to be making gain out of a neighbour’s need. The interest which ancient feeling condemned was thus not the interest taken on a <span class="ital">commercial</span> loan such as is taken habitually in the modern world, but the interest taken on a <span class="ital">charitable</span> loan, which only increases the borrower’s distress. Be the feeling with which the ancients regarded <span class="ital">all</span> interest is of course still rightly maintained against <span class="ital">usurious</span> interest, such as ‘money-lenders’ often exact from those whom need drives into their hands. Cf. the remarks of Grote, <span class="ital">Hist. of Greece</span>, Part II., ch. xi., in connexion with the measures adopted by Solon at Athens for the relief of those who had borrowed money on the security of their own persons (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2 Kings 4:1</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The law of lending money and borrowing</span>. It is peculiar to the Jewish law to forbid the lending of money at interest by citizen to citizen. In the present passage, and in some others (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>), it might seem that interest was only forbidden in the case of a loan to one who was poor; but the general execration of usury (<a href="/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), and the description of the righteous man as "he that hath not given his money upon usury" (<a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), seem rather to imply that the practice, so far as Israelites were concerned, was forbidden altogether. On the other hand, it was distinctly declared (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>) that interest might be taken from strangers. There does not seem to have been any rate of interest which was regarded as excessive, and "usurious," in the modern sense. In Scripture usury means simply interest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The laws which follow, from <a href="/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a> onwards, differ both in form and subject-matter from the determinations of right which we have been studying hitherto: in form, through the omission of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; with which the others were almost invariably introduced; in subject-matter, inasmuch as they make demands upon Israel on the ground of its election to be the holy nation of Jehovah, which go beyond the sphere of natural right, not only prohibiting every inversion of the natural order of things, but requiring the manifestation of love to the infirm and needy out of regard to Jehovah. The transition from the former series to the present one is made by the command in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live;" witchcraft being, on the one hand, "the vilest way of injuring a neighbour in his property, or even in his body and life" (Ranke), whilst, on the other hand, employment of powers of darkness for the purpose of injuring a neighbour was a practical denial of the divine vocation of Israel, as well as of Jehovah the Holy One of Israel. The witch is mentioned instead of the wizard, "not because witchcraft was not to be punished in the case of men, but because the female sex was more addicted to this crime" (Calovius). &#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; (shalt not suffer to live) is chosen instead of the ordinary &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (shall surely die), which is used in <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a> of wizards also, not "because the lawgiver intended that the Hebrew witch should be put to death in any case, and the foreigner only if she would not go when she was banished" (Knobel), but because every Hebrew witch was not to be put to death, but regard was to be had to the fact that witchcraft is often nothing but jugglery, and only those witches were to be put to death who would not give up their witchcraft when it was forbidden. Witchcraft is followed in <a href="/exodus/22-19.htm">Exodus 22:19</a> by the unnatural crime of lying with a beast; and this is also threatened with the punishment of death (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15-16</a>). </body></html>
