With the stranger are naturally placed the widow and orphan; like him, weak and defenceless; like him, special objects of God's care. The negative precept here given was followed up by numerous positive enactments in favour of the widow and the orphan, which much ameliorated their sad lot. (See <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9, 10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12, 13</a>.) On the whole, these laws appear to have been fairly well observed by the Israelites; but there were times when, in spite of them, poor widows suffered much oppression. (See <a href="/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>.)

Whoever persuaded a girl to let him lie with her, was to obtain her for a wife by the payment of a dowry (&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; see <a href="/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a>); and if her father refused to give her to him, he was to weigh (pay) money equivalent to the dowry of maidens, i.e., to pay the father just as much for the disgrace brought upon him by the seduction of his daughter, as maidens would receive for a dowry upon their marriage. The seduction of a girl who was betrothed, was punished much more severely (see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>). </body></html>
