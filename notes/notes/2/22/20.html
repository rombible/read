"For either he would see that it could not have been averted by any human care; or if it could, seeing that he, the owner himself, was present, and did not avert it, it would only be right that he should suffer the consequence of his own neglect to afford assistance" (Calovius).

The suggestion which Knobel makes with a "perhaps," that &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; refers to a hired labourer, to whom the word is applied in other places, and that the meaning is this, "if it is a labourer for hire, he goes into his hire, - i.e., if the hirer is a daily labourer who has nothing with which to make compensation, he is to enter into the service of the person who let him the animal, for a sufficiently long time to make up for the loss," - is not only opposed to the grammar (the perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; for which &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; should be used), but is also at variance with the context, "not make it good." </body></html>
