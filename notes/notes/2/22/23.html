We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12.

The seduction of a girl who was betrothed, was punished much more severely (see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>). </body></html>
