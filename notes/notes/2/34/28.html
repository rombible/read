Serious godliness puts a lustre upon a man's countenance, such as commands esteem and affection. The vail which Moses put on, marked the obscurity of that dispensation, compared with the gospel dispensation of the New Testament. It was also an emblem of the natural vail on the hearts of men respecting spiritual things. Also the vail that was and is upon the nation of Israel, which can only be taken away by the Spirit of the Lord showing to them Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. Fear and unbelief would put the vail before us, they would hinder our free approach to the mercy-seat above. We should spread our wants, temporal and spiritual, fully before our heavenly Father; we should tell him our hinderances, struggles, trails, and temptations; we should acknowledge our offences.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He wrote - i. e.

These were other forty days and nights, besides those he had been with the Lord, when he came down and broke the two tables in his hand, on sight of the idolatry of the people; yea, not only the Jewish writers think that he was on the mount three times forty days and forty nights, but also several learned Christian writers, as Dr. Lightfoot (p) and others; and it seems plain that he went up to the mountain three times, <a href="/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15</a> and it is not improbable that he was each time so long there; about the first and third times there can be no doubt, see <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a> and the text before us; and at the second time, when he went up to make reconciliation for the people, <a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a> he says, that he fell down before the Lord, as at the first forty days and forty nights, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a> and from the seventh day of the month Sivan, the day after the giving of the law, to the tenth of Tisri, on which day he now descended, are just so many days: <p>he did neither eat bread nor drink water: and it is very likely slept not, he being supported without either of these by the power of God; and having such nearness of communion with God, and his mind taken up with what he heard and saw, he had no thoughts of, nor desires and cravings after such things, as well as he stood in no need of them; all which must be ascribed to the miraculous interposition of God in the support of him; see Gill on <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>. <p>and he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments; not Moses, for these were tables of stone, which he could not write or engrave upon without proper instruments, which it does not appear he had with him on the mount; but it was God that wrote them, who, in <a href="/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a> says he would write them, and from <a href="/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Deuteronomy 10:2</a> we are assured he did. <p>(p) Works, vol. 1. p. 715, 716. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he was there with the LORD <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water.

As on the former occasion (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). The patience and faith of the people was tested by this second long delay. Happily, they stood the test; and on Moses' final descent from Sinai the Israelites were found expectant and obedient (vers. 30-32). <span class="cmt_word">He did neither eat bread nor drink water</span>. This was so also on the former occasion (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. The near presence of God sustained the vital powers and made food unnecessary. Moses, Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and our Lord have alone accomplished a fast of this duration. Modern parodies are not held by scientific men to belong to the category of established facts. <span class="cmt_word">He wrote upon the tables</span>. It has been argued from this expression that Moses wrote the words on the second tables; and it would be natural so to understand the passage, had nothing else been said on the subject. But in ver. 1 we are told that "God said, I will write upon these tables;" and the same is repeated in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>. Moreover in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, it is distinctly declared "He" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) "wrote on the tables according to the first writing." We must therefore regard "he" in this passage as meaning "the Lord," which is quite possible according to the Hebrew idiom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The true way to worship Jehovah is then pointed out, first of all negatively, in the prohibition against making molten images, with an allusion to the worship of the golden calf, as evinced by the use of the expression &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a>, instead of the phrase "gods of silver and gold" (<a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a>); and then positively, by a command to observe the feast of Mazzoth and the consecration of the first-born connected with the Passover (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-11.htm">Exodus 13:11</a>, and <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>), also the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>), the feasts of Weeks and Ingathering, the appearance of the male members of the nation three times a year before the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>), together with all the other instructions connected with them (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-25.htm">Exodus 34:25</a>, <a href="/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>). Before the last, however, the promise is introduced, that after the expulsion of the Canaanites, Jehovah would enlarge the borders of Israel (cf. <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>), and make their land so secure, that when they went up to the Lord three times in the year, no one should desire their land, sc., because of the universal dread of the might of their God (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>). </body></html>
