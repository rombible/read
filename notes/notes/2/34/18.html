All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest work will prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbath day in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion with God, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest. Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy; yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desires against God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of duty is the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him. Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of the deliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast of Pentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast of in-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write these words, that the people might know them better. We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant with Israel, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with believers through Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An expansion of <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>.

These were, first, the warning against every kind of league with the Canaanites, who were to be driven out before the Israelites (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11-16</a>); and, secondly, the instructions concerning the true worship of Jehovah (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-17.htm">Exodus 34:17-26</a>). The warning against friendship with the idolatrous Canaanites (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11-16</a>) is more fully developed and more strongly enforced than in <a href="/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>. The Israelites, when received into the covenant with Jehovah, were not only to beware of forming any covenant with the inhabitants of Canaan (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>), but were to destroy all the signs of their idolatrous worship, such as altars, monuments (see <a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>), and asherim, the idols of Astarte, the Canaanitish goddess of nature, which consisted for the most part of wooden pillars (see my Comm. on <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), and to worship no other god, because Jehovah was called jealous, i.e., had revealed Himself as jealous (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), and was a jealous God. This was commanded, that the Israelites might not suffer themselves to be led astray by such an alliance; to go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice to them, to take part in their sacrificial festivals, or to marry their sons to the daughters of the Canaanites, by whom they would be persuaded to join in the worship of idols. The use of the expression "go a whoring" in a spiritual sense, in relation to idolatry, is to be accounted for on the ground, that the religious fellowship of Israel with Jehovah was a covenant resembling the marriage tie; and we meet with it for the first time, here, immediately after the formation of this covenant between Israel and Jehovah. The phrase is all the more expressive on account of the literal prostitution that was frequently associated with the worship of Baal and Astarte (cf. <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5-6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>, etc.). We may see from <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>. how Israel was led astray by this temptation in the wilderness. </body></html>
