It is true the Lord had already promised that His face should go with them (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>); but as Moses had asked for a sign of the glory of the Lord as a seal to the promise, it was perfectly natural that, when this petition was granted, he should lay hold of the grace that had been revealed to him as it never had been before, and endeavour to give even greater stability to the covenant. To this end he repeated his former intercession on behalf of the nation, at the same time making this confession, "For it is a stiff-necked people; therefore forgive our iniquity and our sin, and make us the inheritance." Moses spoke collectively, including himself in the nation in the presence of God. The reason which he assigned pointed to the deep root of corruption that had broken out in the worship of the golden calf, and was appropriately pleaded as a motive for asking forgiveness, inasmuch as God Himself had assigned the natural corruption of the human race as a reason why He would not destroy it again with a flood (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). Wrath was mitigated by a regard to the natural condition. - &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; in the Kal, with an accusative of the person, does not mean to lead a person into the inheritance, but to make a person into an inheritance; here, therefore, to make Israel the possession of Jehovah (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>, cf. <a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>). Jehovah at once declared (<a href="/exodus/34-10.htm">Exodus 34:10</a>) that He would conclude a covenant, i.e., restore the broken covenant, and do marvels before the whole nation, such as had not been done in all the earth or in any nation, and thus by these His works distinguish Israel before all nations as His own property (<a href="/exodus/33-16.htm">Exodus 33:16</a>). The nation was to see this, because it would be terrible; terrible, namely, through the overthrow of the powers that resisted the kingdom of God, every one of whom would be laid prostrate and destroyed by the majesty of the Almighty. </body></html>
