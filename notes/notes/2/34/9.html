The Lord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve the needy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits. Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, only punishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth; even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though they abuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is in faithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercy to sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end of time. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy and goodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by no means clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of his goodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings, the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin is made known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting, sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsake the allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse, neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, and worshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, the believer may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the making holy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This yearning struggle after assurance is like the often-repeated utterance of the heart, when it receives a blessing beyond its hopes, "can this be real?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us&#8212;On this proclamation, he, in the overflowing benevolence of s heart, founded an earnest petition for the Divine Presence being continued with the people; and God was pleased to give His favorable answer to Moses' intercession by a renewal of His promise under the form of a covenant, repeating the leading points that formed the conditions of the former national compact.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is a stiff-necked people</span>, and therefore need thy glorious and powerful presence to rule them.

Dazed, as it would seem, by the splendour of the vision which he had beheld, Moses forgot that God had already pledged himself to renew the covenant, and lead the people in person to Canaan. In his forgetfulness, he once more set himself to intercede with God on their behalf, and besought him - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That  he would go up with them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pardon them; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he would once more take them as his inheritance (ver. 9). Without replying separately to these requests, God formally renews the covenant; promises not only to go up with the people, but to work miracles for them (ver. 10), and to drive out the nations before them when they have arrived (ver. 11); and makes a brief summary of the chief points of positive observance, which he requires of them in addition to the moral law. These points may be reduced to twelve: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That no treaty of peace should be made with the Canaanite nations (ver. 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That all their images, altars, and groves should be destroyed (ver. 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That no molten image should be made to represent God (ver. 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That the Passover festival should be observed as previously commanded (ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That the first-born should be dedicated, or redeemed (vers. 19, 20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> That the Sabbath rest should be observed at all times of the year (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> That the feast of Pentecost (weeks) should be observed regularly (ver. 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> That the feast of tabernacles should also be observed (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> That at all the three great festivals all the males should appear before God (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> That no leaven should be used with any sacrifice (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> That first-fruits of all things should be offered to God (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> That no kid should be seethed in her mother's milk (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If now I have found grace in thy sight</span>. The vision vouchsafed him makes Moses feel that he has indeed been received into favour with God. The first use which it occurs to him to make of his position is to intercede anew for his people, he, apparently, forgets that God has already promised to go with them (<a href="/exodus/33-17.htm">Exodus 33:17</a>), and prefers exactly the same request which he had made on the preceding day, and which had been granted. To this he adds a prayer for <span class="cmt_word">pardon</span>, and a request that God would take Israel <span class="cmt_word">for his inheritance</span>. The last phrase is a new one, but expresses perhaps no more than has been implied in such phrases as "thy people, which thou hast purchased" (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>) - "ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me" (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses had restored the covenant bond through his intercession (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>), he was directed by Jehovah to hew out two stones, like the former ones which he had broken, and to come with them the next morning up the mountain, and Jehovah would write upon them the same words as upon the first, <p>(Note: Namely, the ten words in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-17</a>, not the laws contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-26</a> of this chapter, as Gthe and Hitzig suppose. See Hengstenberg, Dissertations ii. p. 319, and Kurtz on the Old Covenant iii.182ff.)<p>and thus restore the covenant record. It was also commanded, as in the former case (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>), that no one should go up the mountain with him, or be seen upon it, and that not even cattle should feed against the mountain, i.e., in the immediate neighbourhood (<a href="/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>). The first tables of the covenant were called "tables of stone" (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>); the second, on the other hand, which were hewn by Moses, are called "tables of stones" (<a href="/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a> and <a href="/exodus/34-4.htm">Exodus 34:4</a>); and the latter expression is applied indiscriminately to both of them in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-4</a>. This difference does not indicate a diversity in the records, but may be explained very simply from the fact, that the tables prepared by Moses were hewn from two stones, and not both from the same block; whereas all that could be said of the former, which had been made by God Himself, was that they were of stone, since no one knew whether God had used one stone or two for the purpose. There is apparently far more importance in the following distinction, that the second tables were delivered by Moses and only written upon by God, whereas in the case of the former both the writing and the materials came from God. This cannot have been intended either as a punishment for the nation (Hengstenberg), or as "the sign of a higher stage of the covenant, inasmuch as the further the reciprocity extended, the firmer was the covenant" (Baumgarten). It is much more natural to seek for the cause, as Rashi does, in the fact, that Moses had broken the first in pieces; only we must not regard it as a sign that God disapproved of the manifestation of anger on the part of Moses, but rather as a recognition of his zealous exertions for the restoration of the covenant which had been broken by the sin of the nation. As Moses had restored the covenant through his energetic intercession, he should also provide the materials for the renewal of the covenant record, and bring them to God, for Him to complete and confirm the record by writing the covenant words upon the tables.<p>On the following morning, when Moses ascended the mountain, Jehovah granted him the promised manifestation of His glory (<a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>.). The description of this unparalleled occurrence is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and majestic character of the revelation. "Jehovah descended (from heaven) in the cloud, and stood by him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah; and Jehovah passed by in his sight, and proclaimed Jehovah, Jehovah God, merciful and gracious," etc. What Moses saw we are not told, but simply the words in which Jehovah proclaimed all the glory of His being; whilst it is recorded of Moses, that he bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped. This "sermon on the name of the Lord," as Luther calls it, disclosed to Moses the most hidden nature of Jehovah. It proclaimed that God is love, but that kind of love in which mercy, grace, long-suffering, goodness, and truth are united with holiness and justice. As the merciful One, who is great in goodness and truth, Jehovah shows mercy to the thousandth, forgiving sin and iniquity in long-suffering and grace; but He does not leave sin altogether unpunished, and in His justice visits the sin of the fathers upon the children and the children's children even unto the fourth generation. The Lord had already revealed Himself to the whole nation from Mount Sinai as visiting sin and showing mercy (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.). But whereas on that occasion the burning zeal of Jehovah which visits sin stood in the foreground, and mercy only followed afterwards, here grace, mercy, and goodness are placed in the front. And accordingly all the words which the language contained to express the idea of grace in its varied manifestations to the sinner, are crowded together here, to reveal the fact that in His inmost being God is love. But in order that grace may not be perverted by sinners into a ground of wantonness, justice is not wanting even here with its solemn threatenings, although it only follows mercy, to show that mercy is mightier than wrath, and that holy love does not punish til sinners despise the riches of the goodness, patience, and long-suffering of God. As Jehovah here proclaimed His name, so did He continue to bear witness of it to the Israelites, from their departure from Sinai till their entrance into Canaan, and from that time forward till their dispersion among the heathen, and even now in their exile showing mercy to the thousandth, when they turn to the Redeemer who has come out of Zion. </body></html>
