For this purpose an ordinary cloth of goats’-hair was requisite, and accordingly Moses was instructed to make a second covering, which was to be of this material, and to extend over the whole of the first, thus externally concealing it. This second covering was, like the first, to be in two portions (<a href="/context/exodus/26-9.htm" title="And you shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shall double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:9-11</a>), each of them made up of several “breadths,” but the two portions were not to be of the same size. Both were to be thirty cubits in length, but the hinder portion was to contain five “breadths,” while the portion in front was to contain six. Thus the outer covering was six feet broader than the inner one. The object was the protection of the inner covering, which was overlapped at both ends by the outer one (<a href="/exodus/26-9.htm" title="And you shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shall double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-12.htm" title="And the remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:12</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">To be a covering.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">to be a tent. </span>(See the first Note on the chapter.)<p><span class= "bld">Eleven curtains</span>—i.e., eleven breadths.

Curtains of goats' hair, such as the Arabs still use, as the ordinary covering of their tents (Layard, <span class="accented">Nin. and Bab</span>., p. 171), were to form a true "tent" (<span class="accented">ohel</span>) above the  tabernacle, being supported by tent-poles, and kept taut by means of cords and pegs (<a href="/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-18.htm">Exodus 35:18</a>).

The Dwelling-Place. - This was to be formed of a framework of wood, and of tapestry and curtains. The description commences with the tapestry or tent-cloth (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1-14</a>), which made the framework (vv. 15-30) into a dwelling. The inner lining is mentioned first (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1-6</a>), because this made the dwelling into a tent (tabernacle). This inner tent-cloth was to consist of ten curtains (&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), or, as Luther has more aptly rendered it, Teppiche, pieces of tapestry, i.e., of cloth composed of byssus yarn, hyacinth, purple, and scarlet. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1494;&#1512; twisted, signifies yarn composed of various colours twisted together, from which the finer kinds of byssus, for which the Egyptians were so celebrated, were made (vid., Hengstenberg, Egypt, pp. 139ff.). The byssus yarn was of a clear white, and this was woven into mixed cloth by combination with dark blue, and dark and fiery red. It was not to be in simple stripes or checks, however; but the variegated yarn was to be woven (embroidered) into the white byssus, so as to form artistic figures of cherubim ("cherubim, work of the artistic weaver, shalt thou make it"). &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (lit., work or labour of the thinker) is applied to artistic weaving, in which either figures or gold threads (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15</a>) are worked into the cloth, and which is to be distinguished from &#1512;&#1511;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; variegated weaving (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>). </body></html>
