In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The board would therefore be about 15 ft. long, and 27 in. broad.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-30. thou shalt make boards &#8230; rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion &#8230; which was showed thee&#8212;The tabernacle, from its name as well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent, probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as for the protection of its precious furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ten cubits shall be the length of a board,....
