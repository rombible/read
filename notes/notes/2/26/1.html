It is called <span class= "ital">ham-mishkân, “</span>the dwelling,” and <span class= "ital">ha-’ohel, </span>“the tent” (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>)—the former from its purpose, as being the place where God “dwelt” in a peculiar manner (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>); the latter from its shape and general construction, which resembled those of other tents of the period. The necessary foundation was a framework of wood. This consisted of five “pillars,” or tent-poles, in front (<a href="/exodus/26-37.htm" title="And you shall make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and you shall cast five sockets of brass for them.">Exodus 26:37</a>), graduated in height to suit the slope of the roof, and doubtless five similar ones at the back, though these are not mentioned. A ridge-pole must have connected the two central tent-poles, and over this ridge-pole the covering of the tent, which was of goats’-hair (<a href="/exodus/26-7.htm" title="And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering on the tabernacle: eleven curtains shall you make.">Exodus 26:7</a>), was no doubt strained in the ordinary way by means of cords and “pins,” or tent-pegs (<a href="/exodus/35-18.htm" title="The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,">Exodus 35:18</a>). Thus an oblong square space was roofed over, which seems to have been sixty feet long by thirty broad. Within this “tent” (‘<span class= "ital">ohel</span>) was placed the “dwelling” (<span class= "ital">mishkân</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The “dwelling” was a space forty-five feet long by fifteen broad, enclosed on three sides by walls of boards (<a href="/context/exodus/26-18.htm" title="And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.">Exodus 26:18-25</a>), and opening in front into a sort of porch formed by the projection of the “tent” beyond the “dwelling.” Towards the open air this porch was closed, wholly or partially, by a curtain (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>). The “dwelling” was roofed over by another “curtain,” or “hanging,” of bright colours and rich materials (<a href="/context/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1-6</a>). It was divided into two portions, called respectively “the Holy Place,” and “the Holy of Holies”—the former towards the porch, the latter away from it. These two places were separated by a “vail” hung upon four pillars (<a href="/context/exodus/26-31.htm" title="And you shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubim shall it be made:">Exodus 26:31-32</a>). Their relative size is uncertain; but it may be suspected that the Holy of Holies was the smaller of the two, and conjectured that the proportion was as one to two, the Holy of Holies being a square of fifteen feet, and the Holy Place an oblong, thirty feet long by fifteen. The whole structure was placed within an area called “the Court of the Tabernacle,” which is described in the next chapter.<p><span class= "bld">1.

This last circumstance was not only intended to signify that the angels joined in the worship of the God of Israel; but also that they attend continually upon him in his holy habitation as “his ministers to do his pleasure,” <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm" title="Bless you the LORD, all you his hosts; you ministers of his, that do his pleasure.">Psalm 103:21</a>; that they encamp around his church, <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm" title="The angel of the LORD encamps round about them that fear him, and delivers them.">Psalm 34:7</a>; and are always in waiting, so to speak, and ready to minister to the heirs of salvation, <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>.

The tabernacle itself was to consist of curtains of fine linen woven with colored figures of cherubim, and a structure of boards which was to contain the holy place and the most holy place; the tent was to be a true tent of goats' hair cloth to contain and shelter the tabernacle: the covering was to be of red rams' skins and "tachash" skins <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>, and was spread over the goats' hair tent as an additional protection against the weather.

Here Jehovah dwells, grants his presence to his people, and comes and blesses them; here he is worshipped, and spiritual sacrifices are offered up to him with acceptance: the tabernacle of Moses was made  <p>with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet; the ground of these curtains was fine linen, twined or doubled: and the Jewish writers, as Maimonides, Ben Gersom, and others, say it was six times doubled, the word "Shesh", here used, signifying six; and this was interwoven with threads of yarn dyed blue, purple, and scarlet; according to Jarchi, the threads of which this tapestry was made were twenty four times doubled: he observes,"there were four sorts in every thread, one thread of fine linen, and three of wool, and every thread was doubled six times; lo, the four sorts, when they were twined together, there were twenty four double to a thread;''which if so, must make a stuff of a very great consistence and stiffness. This, as applied to the human nature of Christ, the fine linen may denote the purity of it; the various colours the different graces of the Spirit, with which it is adorned; or else the wounds, bruises, bloodshed, sufferings and death he endured in it: as applied to the church, may signify the clothing of the saints with the righteousness of Christ, that fine linen clean and white, and their being washed in his precious blood, and beautified with the graces of his Spirit: <p>with cherubim of cunning work shall thou make them; that is, with figures like those of the cherubim on the mercy seat, so disposed by the curious art and contrivance of the weaver, as to appear on both sides of this tapestry; for this was not wrought by a needle, which only shows the figure on one side, but by weaving, as Jarchi observes; and who says, that there was one figure on one side, and another on another; as, for instance, a lion on one side, and an eagle on the other; or, which is more likely, the same figure was seen on both sides, as Maimonides affirms, who says (e), the work called Chosheb (which is what is here spoken of) is that whose figures appear on both sides, before and behind: this in the mystical sense may point either to the ministration of angels to Christ in his human nature, and to his people the heirs of salvation; or else to the service of Gospel ministers, done for the honour and glory of Christ, and the good of his church and people: Josephus (f) thinks these curtains had a mystical meaning in them, and represent the nature of the elements, and so Philo (g). <p>(e) Hilchot Cele Hamikdash, c. 8. sect. 15.

The sacred furniture which the tabernacle was to contain having been described, with the exception of the "altar of incense" the description of which is reserved for ch 30.

These "ten curtains" are explained in the verses which follow to be ten "breadths," so fastened together as to form practically a single curtain or awning, which constituted the cieling or inner covering of the tabernacle. The mode of its arrangement is not quite certain. Some suppose that it was really a part of the "tent," being laid over the same framework as the goats' hair curtain (Fergusson, Cook); others believe it to have been strained across the <span class="accented">mishkan</span> and fastened to the top of the boards on either side, thence depending, either inside or outside (Bahr, Keil).
