THE WALLS OF THE TABERNACLE.</span><p>(15-30) The various coverings which have been described had it for their object to roof over and protect an oblong chamber or “dwelling,” within which God was to manifest Himself and to be worshipped. The directions which follow (<a href="/context/exodus/26-15.htm" title="And you shall make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up.">Exodus 26:15-33</a>) are for the construction of this chamber. It was to be enclosed by boards of shittim wood, fifteen feet high by two feet three inches wide, which were to be plated with gold, and made to stand upright by being inserted into solid sockets of silver. The two sides were to contain, each of them, twenty such boards, and thus to be forty-five feet long, while the connecting wall was to be composed of six such boards, together with two corner posts (<a href="/exodus/26-23.htm" title="And two boards shall you make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.">Exodus 26:23</a>), giving it a length, probably, of ten cubits, or fifteen feet.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Boards . . . of shittim wood.</span>—On the possibility of boards fifteen feet long by two feet three inches wide being cut from the <span class= "ital">Acacia seyal, </span>see the last Note on <a href="/exodus/25-5.htm" title="And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,">Exodus 25:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/26-15.htm" title="And you shall make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up.">Exodus 26:15</a></span>. Very particular directions are here given about the <span class="ital">boards of the tabernacle, </span>which were to bear up the curtains. These had tenons which fell into the mortises that were made for them in silver bases. The boards were coupled together with gold rings at top and bottom, and kept firm with bars that ran through golden staples in every board. Thus every thing in the tabernacle was very splendid, agreeable to that infant state of the church, when such things were proper to possess the minds of the worshippers with a reverence of the divine glory. In allusion to this, the new Jerusalem is said to be of <span class="ital">pure gold, </span><a href="/revelation/21-18.htm" title="And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like to clear glass.">Revelation 21:18</a>. But the builders of the gospel church said, <span class="ital">silver and gold have we none; </span>and yet the glory of their building far exceeded that of the tabernacle. St. Paul, probably, alludes to this tabernacle, with its pillars and sockets, when he terms the church <span class="ital">the pillar and ground </span>(<span class="greekheb">εδραιωμα</span>, <span class="ital">seat </span>rather) <span class="ital">of the truth, </span><a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>. As beauty and strength were united in the tabernacle, so they are in the church of Christ: “beauty, which renders it the admiration of angels; and strength, which defies all the malice of devils.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:15-30 The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placed in rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The measure of the entire tabernacle-cloth was about 60 ft. by 42; that of the tent-cloth was about 67 ft. by 45.

(the "half-curtain," <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-9.htm">Exodus 26:9</a>, <a href="/exodus/26-12.htm">Exodus 26:12</a>) and at the sides 18 inches.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-30. thou shalt make boards &#8230; rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion &#8230; which was showed thee&#8212;The tabernacle, from its name as well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent, probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as for the protection of its precious furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle,....

The Heb. <span class="ital">ḳéresh</span>, except in the present connexion (50 times), occurs only <a href="/ezekiel/27-6.htm" title="Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars; the company of the Ashurites have made your benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, of some part of a ship, described there as made up of ivory, inlaid in boxwood (RV. <span class="ital">benches</span>, RVm. <span class="ital">deck</span>); and its exact sense is uncertain. Here it has commonly been rendered <span class="ital">boards</span>: but to this rend. Kennedy (p. 659b) makes the pertinent objections that, if these ‘boards’ are to support the curtains, the latter must hang down outside them: the boards, however, standing, as they are described, close to each other, would form, on the two sides and back of the Tabernacle, three solid wooden walls; if, then, the Dwelling on three, of its sides was formed of these wooden walls, it is difficult to understand how it can be consistently spoken of as formed by the <span class="ital">curtains</span> (<span class="ital">v.</span> 1, &c.): and, moreover, if the sides of the Dwelling were thus solid, these richly worked curtains would be hidden from view, not only on the outside, as they would be in any case, by the curtain of goats’ hair and the two skin coverings, but also on the inside (except on the roof). Hence Kennedy argues, with much force, that the <span class="ital">ḳĕrâshim</span> were pictured, not as solid boards, but as wooden <span class="ital">frames</span> (as shewn in the illustr.), which, while affording sufficient support for the curtains and skin coverings, would allow the richly coloured tapestry curtains with their cherubim figures to appear inside the sanctuary. Kennedy’s view undoubtedly brings a very great improvement into the idea of the Tabernacle: but the sense attached to <span class="ital">ḳéresh</span> being hypothetical, it is difficult to accept it quite unreservedly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A ‘Frame,’ with its bases.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Reduced from Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, iv. 660.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">thickness</span> of the <span class="ital">ḳĕrâshim</span> is not specified.
