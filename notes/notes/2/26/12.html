As the Dwelling Isaiah 30 cubits long and 10 cubits high, it follows that, according to the usual view of <span class="ital">v.</span> 9b, 12 cubits will hang down behind, according to Kennedy’s view, 10 cubits will hang down behind. The ‘half-curtain’ (= 2 cubits) overhanging a the back can thus, upon the usual view, be only the 2 cubits in excess of the 10 (so Di.), the whole 12, we may suppose, being stretched out, and pegged to the ground in the manner of a tent: it is not, however, very natural to speak of only the 2 cubits as hanging down loosely behind: we should rather expect the whole 12 to be so spoken of. The difficulty would be removed, if we might suppose the words, ‘the half-curtain that remaineth,’ in <span class="ital">v.</span> 12 to be a mistaken gloss, arising out of a hasty reading of <span class="ital">v.</span> 9b: if these words are omitted, the length of the part hanging down behind is not specified, and it might, of course, be either the 12 cubits required by the ordinary view of <span class="ital">v.</span> 9b, or the 10 cubits required by Kennedy’s view. The latter view does better justice to <span class="ital">v.</span> 9b, and also has the advantage of making the goats’ hair curtain hang down symmetrically on the two sides and the back, viz. so a exactly to touch the ground in each case.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The remnant which remaineth</span>, etc. Both this and the next verse presume a very close connection between the fine linen covering of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span> and the goats hair tent-cloth which protected it. "The remnant that remaineth" is the half-breadth by which the tent-cloth would overlap the linen covering at the back of the tent, when at the front half of the eleventh breadth had been turned back upon the other half (see comment on ver. 9). This "remnant" was to be 'allowed to hang down over the back part of the tabernacle. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fifty golden clasps were also to be made, to fasten the pieces of drapery (the two halves of the tent-cloth) together, "that it might be a dwelling-place." This necessarily leads to Bhr's conclusion, that the tent-cloth, which consisted of two halves fastened together with the loops and clasps, answering to the two compartments of the dwelling-place (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>), enclosed the whole of the interior, not only covering the open framework above, but the side walls also, and therefore that it hung down inside the walls, and that it was not spread out upon the wooden framework so as to form the ceiling, but hung down on the walls on the outside of the wooden beams, so that the gilded beams were left uncovered in the inside. For if this splendid tent-cloth had been intended for the ceiling only, and therefore only 30 cubits had been visible out of the 40 cubits of its breadth, and only 10 out of the 28 of its length-that is to say, if not much more than a third of the whole had been seen and used for the inner lining of the dwelling, - that is to say, if not much more than a third of the whole had been seen and used for the inner lining of the dwelling, - it would not have been called "the dwelling" so constantly as it is (cf. <a href="/exodus/36-8.htm">Exodus 36:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-18.htm">Exodus 40:18</a>), nor would the goats'-hair covering which was placed above it have been just as constantly called the "tent above the dwelling" (<a href="/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-19.htm">Exodus 40:19</a>). This inner tent-cloth was so spread out, that whilst it was fastened to the upper ends of the beams in a way that is not explained in the text, it formed the ceiling of the whole, and the joining came just above the curtain which divided the dwelling into two compartments. One half therefore, viz., the front half, formed the ceiling of the holy place with its entire breadth of 20 cubits and 10 cubits of its length, and the remaining 18 cubits of its length hung down over the two side walls, 9 cubits down each wall, - the planks that formed the walls being left uncovered, therefore, to the height of 1 cubit from the ground. In a similar manner the other half covered the holy of holies, 10 cubits of both length and breadth forming the ceiling, and the 10 cubits that remained of the entire length covering the end wall; whilst the folds in the corners that arose from the 9 cubits that hung down on either side, were no doubt so adjusted that the walls appeared to be perfectly smooth. (For further remarks, see <a href="/exodus/39-33.htm">Exodus 39:33</a>.) </body></html>
