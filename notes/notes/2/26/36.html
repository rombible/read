THE HANGING FOR THE DOOR.</span><p>(36, 37) It is essential in the East to shut out light and heat, whence tents have always doors. These are usually made of a piece of cloth, which is raised for a man to enter, and falls behind him. But for a tent of the size described, which seems to have been above twenty-two feet high in the centre, something more was required. The “hanging” spoken of appears to have been a beautifully embroidered curtain, which could be either drawn up or let down, and which was attached by golden “hooks” to five pillars plated with gold, thus dividing the entrance into four equal spaces.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a></span>. <span class="ital">Make a hanging for the door of the tent — </span>It is plain from the former part of this description, (<a href="/context/exodus/26-12.htm" title="And the remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle....">Exodus 26:12-23</a>,) that the <span class="ital">ark </span>and <span class="ital">mercy-seat </span>were in the west end of the tabernacle, that is, the door or entrance fronted the east: so that the Israelites, in worshipping Jehovah, turned their faces toward the west, where the ark was; it being thus contrived, says Theodoret, that the sun might pay a kind of symbolical adoration to Jehovah, by darting his first rays into the sanctuary, and that the Israelites might be thus figuratively, taught to turn from the worship of that luminary, the great idol of the nations, and to adore the God who made him.

It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The door of the tent - The entrance to the tent, closed by the "hanging" or curtain <a href="/exodus/27-16.htm">Exodus 27:16</a>.<p>Wrought with needlework. - The work of the embroiderer.

In a similar style of elegance was the hanging finished which was to cover the door of this tabernacle&#8212;the chosen habitation of the God and King of Israel. It appears from Ex 26:12, 22, 23, that the ark and mercy seat were placed in the west end of the tabernacle, and consequently the door or entrance fronted the east, so that the Israelites in worshipping Jehovah, turned their faces towards the west; that they might be thus figuratively taught to turn from the worship of that luminary which was the great idol of the nations, and to adore the God who made it and them [Hewlett].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the door of the tent</span>, i.e. of the holy place, where it was divided from the court of the people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent,....

Even the setting up and position of the dwelling were not left to human judgment, but were to be carried out &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;, i.e., according to the direction corresponding to its meaning and purpose. From the description which is given of the separate portions, it is evident that the dwelling was to be set up in the direction of the four quarters of the heavens, the back being towards the west, and the entrance to the east; whilst the whole of the dwelling formed an oblong of thirty cubits long, ten broad, and ten high. The length we obtain from the twenty boards of a cubit and a half in breadth; and the breadth, by adding to the nine cubits covered by the six boards at the back, half a cubit as the inner thickness of each of the corner beams. The thickness of the corner beams is not given, but we may conjecture that on the outside which formed part of the back they were three-quarters of a cubit thick, and that half a cubit is to be taken as the thickness towards the side. In this case, on the supposition that the side beams were a quarter of a cubit thick, the inner space would be exactly ten cubits broad and thirty and a quarter long; but the surplus quarter would be taken up by the thickness of the pillars upon which the inner curtain was hung, so that the room at the back would form a perfect cube, and the one at the front an oblong of exactly twenty cubits in length, ten in breadth, and ten in height. </body></html>
