They were fifteen in number, five for each of the three sides of the boarded space. The “middle bar” on each side was to extend from end to end of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-28.htm" title="And the middle bar in the middle of the boards shall reach from end to end.">Exodus 26:28</a>), the four bars above and below being shorter, each coupling together probably one-half of the boards of its side.

In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The corner boards appear to have been of such width, and so placed, as to add 18 in. to the width of the structure, making up with the six boards of full width <a href="/exodus/26-22.htm">Exodus 26:22</a> about 15 ft. in the clear (see <a href="/exodus/26-18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>).

Several rows or orders of bars, one bar beginning at the end of the other, and each containing four cubits in length, and altogether twenty cubits, which was the length of the tabernacle; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Single bars, which seem truer, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the word signifies <span class="ital">bars</span>, not <span class="ital">rows of bars</span>; and why should we go from the proper signification of the word without cause? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. If <span class="ital">bars</span> be put for rows of bars, there must be five rows of bars on a side, there being so many bars said to be on a side. But the abettors of that opinion allow only four rows of bars on a side; and it is apparent the middle bar, which is one of the five, is but one single bar, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/26-28.htm" title="And the middle bar in the middle of the boards shall reach from end to end.">Exodus 26:28</a></span>, and therefore it may be presumed the rest were so too. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The name of the middle bar implies, that of the other four bars, two were above it, and two below it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object</span>. But if they were each single bars, reaching the whole length of the building, why is it said peculiarly of the middle bar, that it should <span class="ital">reach from end to end</span>, or <span class="ital">from extremity to extremity</span>? <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/26-28.htm" title="And the middle bar in the middle of the boards shall reach from end to end.">Exodus 26:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ</span>. This may be peculiarly said of this, either because the other four might want something of the just length of the building, or because the middle bar might stand out beyond the two ends of it, for conveniency of the carriage of the building. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood,  Which being put into rings or staples of gold, kept the boards tight, close, and firm together: <p>five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle: for instance, the south side; four of these were placed, two at the upper end of the boards, and two at the lower end, and the fifth in the middle, particularly taken notice of, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-28.htm">Exodus 26:28</a>, how long these bars were it is not said, but it is reasonable to conclude that they reached the length of the tabernacle, which was thirty cubits; and as it was not easy to get bars of such a length, the notion of Josephus (u) perhaps, may be right, that each two consisted of divers parts which joined one another, the head of one entering into the hollow of the other and as he supposes they were five cubits long, a row of them must have six parts, which went along the sides, north and south, and the west end two, which was but ten cubits. <p>(u) Ut supra.

Five gilt bars of acacia wood, attached to the frames by gold rings, are to run horizontally along the two sides and the back of the Dwelling, to keep the frames in their places.

To give greater stability to the structure, to keep the boards in their places, and to prevent there being any aperture between them, five bars were to be made for each side, and the same number for the end, of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>, which were to be passed through rings attached to the boards - one at least to each - and thus to hold the boards firmly together. The middle bar in each case was to extend the whole length of the enclosure (ver. 28), and thus in two cases to be thirty cubits, or forty-five feet long. The exact length, and the disposition of the other bars is not indicated; but it is with reason conjectured that two were above and two below the "middle bar" that all were horizontal - and that each coupled together one half of the boards of each side. The length of each was probably fifteen cubits; and the ends which reached the two comer posts at the back ran into the corner rings, which were shaped so as to receive the two bars (see ver. 24). It is not said whether the bars were inside or outside the mishkan; but the best authorities suppose them to have been outside. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Twenty of these boards were to be prepared for the side of the dwelling that was turned towards the south, and forty sockets (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; foundations, <a href="/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>) or bases for the pegs, i.e., to put the pegs of the boards into, that the boards might stand upright; and the same number of boards and sockets for the north side. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, "southward," is added to &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1488;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>, to give a clearer definition of negeb, which primarily means the dry, and then the country to the south; an evident proof that at that time negeb was not established as a geographical term for the south, and therefore that it was not written here by a Palestinian, as Knobel supposes, but by Moses in the desert.<p>The form of the "sockets" is not explained, and even in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27</a>, in the summing up of the gifts presented for the work, it is merely stated that a talent of silver (about 93 lb.) was applied to every socket. </body></html>
