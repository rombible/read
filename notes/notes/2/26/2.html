God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, Ps 34:7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/36-8.htm">Exodus 36:8-33</a>.) The tabernacle was to comprise three main parts, the tabernacle <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1-6</a>, more strictly so-called, its tent <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7-13</a>, and its covering <a href="/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a> (Compare <a href="/exodus/35-11.htm">Exodus 35:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-33.htm">Exodus 39:33-34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-19.htm">Exodus 40:19</a>, <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25</a>, etc.). These parts are very clearly distinguished in the Hebrew, but they are confounded in many places of the English Version (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-9.htm">Exodus 26:9</a>, etc.). The tabernacle itself was to consist of curtains of fine linen woven with colored figures of cherubim, and a structure of boards which was to contain the holy place and the most holy place; the tent was to be a true tent of goats' hair cloth to contain and shelter the tabernacle: the covering was to be of red rams' skins and "tachash" skins <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>, and was spread over the goats' hair tent as an additional protection against the weather. On the external form of the tabernacle and the arrangement of its parts, see cuts at the end of the chapter.<p><a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a><p>The tabernacle - The &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;  m&#305;&#770;shka&#770;n, i. e. the dwelling-place; the definite article regularly accompanies the Hebrew word when the dwelling-place of Yahweh is denoted. But in this place the word is not used in its full sense as denoting the dwelling-place of Yahweh: it denotes only the tabernacle-cloth <a href="/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a>. The word is, in fact, employed with three distinct ranges of meaning,<p>(1) in its strict sense, comprising the cloth of the tabernacle with its woodwork (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-13.htm">Exodus 36:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-18.htm">Exodus 40:18</a>, etc.);<p>(2) in a narrower sense, for the tabernacle-cloth only (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-11.htm">Exodus 35:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-33.htm">Exodus 39:33-34</a>, etc.);<p>(3) in a wider sense, for the tabernacle with its tent and covering (<a href="/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-18.htm">Exodus 35:18</a>, etc.).<p>With ten curtains - Rather, of ten breadths. Five of these breadths were united so as to form what, in common usage, we should call a large curtain <a href="/exodus/26-3.htm">Exodus 26:3</a>.

The colored figures of cherubim (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>, <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a>) were to be worked in the loom, as in the manufacture of tapestry and carpets (see <a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a> note).

This is the exact length required for a rectangular tented roof over such a space, which should descend (as tent roofs usually do) within about seven feet of the ground. The comparison made in vers. 12, 13, between the fine linen covering of the mishkan and the goats' hair covering of the "tent," implies that the one was directly under the other, and that both were arranged in the same way<span class="cmt_word">. The breadth of four cubits</span>. This gives for the entire length of the curtain (4 by 10), 40 cubits, or ten cubits more than the length of the boarded space. The roof must thus have been advanced some distance in front of the tabernacle proper, or rectangular boarded space. <span class="cmt_word">Every one of the curtains shall have one measure</span>. They shall all, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, have the same measure. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Their knobs and their pipes (i.e., the knobs and pipes of the three pairs of arms) shall be of it (the candlestick, i.e., combined with it so as to form one whole), all one (one kind of) beaten work, pure gold." From all this we get the following idea of the candlestick: Upon the vase there rose an upright central pipe, from which three side pies branched out one above another on either side, and curved upwards in the form of a quadrant to the level of the central stem. On this stem a calix and a knob and blossom were introduced four separate times, and in such a manner that there was a knob wherever the side pipes branched off from the main stem, evidently immediately below the branches; and the fourth knob, we may suppose, was higher up between the top branches and the end of the stem. As there were thus four calices with a knob and blossom in the main stem, so again there were three in each of the branches, which were no doubt placed at equal distances from one another. With regard to the relative position of the calix, the knob, and the blossom, we may suppose that the spherical knob was underneath the calix, and that the blossom sprang from the upper edge of the latter, as if bursting out of it. The candlestick had thus seven arms, and seven lights or lamps were to be made and placed upon them (&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;). "And they (all the lamps) are to give light upon the opposite side of its front" (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>): i.e., the lamp was to throw its light upon the side that was opposite to the front of the candlestick. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; of the candlestick (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a> and <a href="/numbers/8-2.htm">Numbers 8:2</a>) was the front shown by the seven arms, as they formed a straight line with their seven points; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; does not mean the side, but the opposite side, as is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-2.htm">Numbers 8:2</a>, where we find &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500; instead. As the place assigned to the candlestick was on the south side of the dwelling-place, we are to understand by this opposite side the north, and imagine the lamp to be so placed that the line of lamps formed by the seven arms ran from front to back, by which arrangement the holy place would be better lighted, than if the candlestick had stood with the line of lamps from south to north, and so had turned all its seven lamps towards the person entering the holy place. The lamps were the receptacles for the wick and oil, which were placed on the top of the arms, and could be taken down to be cleaned. The hole from which the wick projected was not made in the middle, but at the edge, so that the light was thrown upon one side.</body></html>
