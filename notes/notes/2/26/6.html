God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, Ps 34:7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taches of gold - Each "tache," or clasp, was to unite two opposite loops.<p>Couple the curtains - i. e. couple the two outside breadths mentioned in <a href="/exodus/26-4.htm">Exodus 26:4</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. taches&#8212;clasps; supposed in shape, as well as in use, to be the same as hooks and eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">The taches, or hooks or buttons</span>, which were put into the loops to unite and fasten the curtains. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold,....

The two curtains, each composed of five "breadths," were to be united by means of one hundred loops, fifty on each curtain, which were to be coupled together by fifty "taches" or clasps. The loops were to be of the "blue" material used generally in the textile fabrics of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 31, 36</a>), and the "taches" or clasps were to be of gold. In this way the covering of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span> was to be completed. <span class="accented">The goat's skin tent-cloth</span> (vers. 7-13). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Of a talent of pure gold (i.e., 822,000 Parisian grains) shall he make it (the candlestick) and all these vessels," i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/37-24.htm">Exodus 37:24</a>, all the vessels belonging to the candlestick. From this quantity of gold it was possible to make a candlestick of very considerable size. The size is not given anywhere in the Old Testament, but, according to Bhr's conjecture, it corresponded to the height of the table of shew-bread, namely, a cubit and a half in height and the same in breadth, or a cubit and a half between the two outside lamps.<p>The signification of the seven-armed candlestick is apparent from its purpose, viz., to carry seven lamps, which were trimmed and filled with oil every morning, and lighted every evening, and were to burn throughout the night (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3-4</a>). As the Israelites were to prepare spiritual food in the shew-bread in the presence of Jehovah, and to offer continually the fruit of their labour in the field of the kingdom of God, as a spiritual offering to the Lord; so also were they to present themselves continually to Jehovah in the burning lamps, as the vehicles and media of light, as a nation letting its light shine in the darkness of this world (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The oil, through which the lamps burned and shone, was, according to its peculiar virtue in imparting strength to the body and restoring vital power, a representation of the Godlike spirit, the source of all the vital power of man; whilst the oil, as offered by the congregation of Israel, and devoted to sacred purposes according to the command of God, is throughout the Scriptures a symbol of the Spirit of God, by which the congregation of God was tilled with higher light and life. By the power of this Spirit, Israel, in covenant with the Lord, was to let its light shine, the light of its knowledge of God and spiritual illumination, before all the nations of the earth. In its seven arms the stamp of the covenant relationship was impressed upon the candlestick; and the almond-blossom with which it was ornamented represented the seasonable offering of the flowers and fruits of the Spirit, the almond-tree deriving its name &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; from the fact that it is the earliest of all the trees in both its blossom and its fruit (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>). The symbolical character of the candlestick is clearly indicated in the Scriptures. The prophet Zechariah (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1-14</a>) sees a golden candlestick with seven lamps and two olive-trees, one on either side, from which the oil-vessel is supplied; and the angel who is talking with him informs him that the olive-trees are the two sons of oil, that is to say, the representatives of the kingdom and priesthood, the divinely appointed organs through which the Spirit of God was communicated to the covenant nation. And in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>, the seven churches, which represent the new people of God, i.e., the Christian Church, are shown to the holy seer in the form of seven candlesticks standing before the throne of God. - On <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>, see at <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>. </body></html>
