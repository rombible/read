From this quantity of gold it was possible to make a candlestick of very considerable size. The size is not given anywhere in the Old Testament, but, according to Bhr's conjecture, it corresponded to the height of the table of shew-bread, namely, a cubit and a half in height and the same in breadth, or a cubit and a half between the two outside lamps.<p>The signification of the seven-armed candlestick is apparent from its purpose, viz., to carry seven lamps, which were trimmed and filled with oil every morning, and lighted every evening, and were to burn throughout the night (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3-4</a>). As the Israelites were to prepare spiritual food in the shew-bread in the presence of Jehovah, and to offer continually the fruit of their labour in the field of the kingdom of God, as a spiritual offering to the Lord; so also were they to present themselves continually to Jehovah in the burning lamps, as the vehicles and media of light, as a nation letting its light shine in the darkness of this world (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The oil, through which the lamps burned and shone, was, according to its peculiar virtue in imparting strength to the body and restoring vital power, a representation of the Godlike spirit, the source of all the vital power of man; whilst the oil, as offered by the congregation of Israel, and devoted to sacred purposes according to the command of God, is throughout the Scriptures a symbol of the Spirit of God, by which the congregation of God was tilled with higher light and life. By the power of this Spirit, Israel, in covenant with the Lord, was to let its light shine, the light of its knowledge of God and spiritual illumination, before all the nations of the earth. In its seven arms the stamp of the covenant relationship was impressed upon the candlestick; and the almond-blossom with which it was ornamented represented the seasonable offering of the flowers and fruits of the Spirit, the almond-tree deriving its name &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; from the fact that it is the earliest of all the trees in both its blossom and its fruit (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>). The symbolical character of the candlestick is clearly indicated in the Scriptures. The prophet Zechariah (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1-14</a>) sees a golden candlestick with seven lamps and two olive-trees, one on either side, from which the oil-vessel is supplied; and the angel who is talking with him informs him that the olive-trees are the two sons of oil, that is to say, the representatives of the kingdom and priesthood, the divinely appointed organs through which the Spirit of God was communicated to the covenant nation. And in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>, the seven churches, which represent the new people of God, i.e., the Christian Church, are shown to the holy seer in the form of seven candlesticks standing before the throne of God. - On <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>, see at <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>. </body></html>
