The lesser of these rooms, thus parted from the other so as none could look into it, was to be called <span class="ital">the most holy place, </span>or place of extraordinary worship, to be entered by the high-priest alone, and that but once a year.

But by leaving it thus exposed, 1st, The priests and Levites would be so much the more obliged to keep a strict watch upon it: and, 2d, God would show his care of his church on earth, though it be weak and defenceless, and continually exposed.

It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Vail - Literally, separation (see <a href="/exodus/35-12.htm">Exodus 35:12</a> note).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-30. thou shalt make boards &#8230; rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion &#8230; which was showed thee&#8212;The tabernacle, from its name as well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent, probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as for the protection of its precious furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt make a veil</span>, which was thick and strong that none could see through it, called the <span class="ital">second veil</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hebrews/9-3.htm" title="And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;">Hebrews 9:3</a></span>, whereby the holy of holies, which represented the highest heaven, was divided from the holy place, where the church militant, or its representatives, met and served God, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/26-33.htm" title="And you shall hang up the veil under the clasps, that you may bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony: and the veil shall divide to you between the holy place and the most holy.">Exodus 26:33</a></span>.

The use of this, as follows, was to divide the holy place from the most holy place in the tabernacle; it has its name from hardness, it being very stiff and strong, for it was made of thread six times doubled, and was four fingers thick, as the Jewish writers say: this vail may represent the sin of man, which separates between God and man, was removed by the death of Christ when the vail was rent, and so the way to heaven opened; or the obscurity of the legal dispensation, the Gospel being veiled under the shadows of the law, and the way into the holiest of all then not so manifest, and particularly the ceremonial law, which separated between Jew and Gentile, and is now abolished by the death of Christ; or rather it was typical of the human nature of Christ, his flesh, called in allusion to it the vail of his flesh, <a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>.

It being made of "fine linen" denotes the purity of Christ, of his nature, life, and righteousness; of "twined linen", his strength, courage and steadiness; "of blue, purple, and scarlet", the several graces of the Spirit, with which his human nature was adorned, his flaming zeal for his Father's glory and the good of his people, his bloody wounds, sufferings, and death, the preciousness of his blood, the dignity of his person, and his glorious exaltation, purple and scarlet being the colours wore by kings: <p>with cherubim shall it be made; signifying either the ministration of angels to him in his incarnate state, or the mission of Gospel ministers by him, see <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>. <p>(x) Vid.
