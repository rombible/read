In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the midst of the boards - If we suppose the boards to have been of ordinary thickness <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-16.htm">Exodus 26:16</a>, the bar was visible and passed through an entire row of rings.

These corner boards (<a href="/exodus/26-24.htm">Exodus 26:24</a>) were to be "doubled (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1501;) from below, and whole (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, integri, forming a whole) at its head (or towards its head, cf. &#1488;&#1500; <a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a>) with regard to the one ring, so shall it be to both of them (so shall they both be made); to the two corners shall they be" (i.e., designed for the two hinder corners). The meaning of these words, which are very obscure in some points, can only be the following: the two corner beams at the tack were to consist of two pieces joined together at a right angle, so as to form as double boards one single whole from the bottom to the top. The expressions "from below" and "up to its head" are divided between the two predicates "doubled" (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;) and "whole" (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), but they belong to both of them. Each of the corner beams was to be double from the bottom to the top, and still to form one whole. There is more difficulty in the words &#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; in <a href="/exodus/26-24.htm">Exodus 26:24</a>. It is impossible to attach any intelligible meaning to the rendering "to the first ring," so that even Knobel, who proposed it, has left it unexplained. There is hardly any other way of explaining it, than to take the word &#1488;&#1500; in the sense of "having regard to a thing," and to understand the words as meaning, that the corner beams were to form one whole, from the face that each received only one ring, probably at the corner, and not two, viz., one on each side. This one ring was placed half-way up the upright beam in the corner or angle, in such a manner that the central bolt, which stretched along the entire length of the walls (<a href="/exodus/26-28.htm">Exodus 26:28</a>), might fasten into it from both the side and back. </body></html>
