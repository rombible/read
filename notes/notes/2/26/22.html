The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sides of the tabernacle westward - Rather, the back of the tabernacle toward the west.

Here there were to be six boards only, which would give the abnormal and improbable width of nine cubits. The additional cubit required was no doubt obtained from the corner boards, or posts, each of which added to the (internal) width half a cubit (see ver. 23). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The wooden framework. - <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15</a>, <a href="/exodus/26-16.htm">Exodus 26:16</a>. The boards for the dwelling were to be made "of acacia-wood standing," i.e., so that they could stand upright; each ten cubits long and one and a half broad. The thickness is not given; and if, on the one hand, we are not to imagine them too thin, as Josephus does, for example, who says they were only four fingers thick (Ant. iii. 6, 3), we have still less reason for following Rashi, Lund, Bhr and others, who suppose them to have been a cubit in thickness, thus making simple boards into colossal blocks, such as could neither have been cut from acacia-trees, nor carried upon desert roads.<p>(Note: Kamphausen (Stud. und Krit. 1859, p. 117) appeals to Bhr's Symbolik 1, p. 261-2, and Knobel, Exod. p. 261, in support of the opinion, that at any rate formerly there were genuine acacias of such size and strength, that beams could have been cut from them a cubit and a half broad and a cubit thick; but we look in vain to either of these writings for such authority as will establish this fact. Expressions like those of Jerome and Hasselquist, viz., grandes arbores and arbos ingens ramosissima, are far too indefinite. It is true that, according to Abdullatif, the Sont is "a very large tree," but he gives a quotation from Dinuri, in which it is merely spoken of as "a tree of the size of a nut-tree." See the passages cited in Rosenmller's bibl. Althk. iv. 1, p. 278, Not. 7, where we find the following remark of Wesling on Prosper. Alpin. de plantis Aeg.: Caudicem non raro ampliorem deprehendi, quam ut brachio meo circumdari possit. Even the statement of Theophrast (hist. plant. 4, 3), to the effect that rafters are cut from these trees 12 cubits long (&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;), is no proof that they were beams a cubit and a half broad and a cubit thick. And even if there had been trees of this size in the peninsula of Sinai in Moses' time, a beam of such dimensions, according to Kamphausen's calculation, which is by no means too high, would have weighed more than twelve cwt. And certainly the Israelites could never have carried beams of this weight with them through the desert; for the waggons needed would have been such as could never be used where there are no beaten roads.)<p>To obtain boards of the required breadth, to or three planks were no doubt joined together according to the size of the trees. </body></html>
