It was twice as high as it was broad, being twenty-one inches broad and three feet six inches high. It had "horns"; its top or flat surface was surmounted by an ornamental ledge or rim, called a crown, and it was furnished at the sides with rings for carriage. Its only accompanying piece of furniture was a golden censer or pan, in which the incense was set fire to upon the altar. Hence it was called the altar of incense, or the "golden altar" [Ex 39:38; 40:26], from the profuse degree in which it was gilded or overlaid with the precious metal. This splendor was adapted to the early age of the church, but in later times, when the worship was to be more spiritual, the altar of incense is prophetically described as not of gold but of wood, and double the size of that in the tabernacle, because the church should be vastly extended (Mal 1:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm" title="And you shall make the horns of it on the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and you shall overlay it with brass.">Exodus 27:2</a></span>.

The daily morning and evening sacrifices were to be "for a sweet savour, a firing unto Jehovah" (see at <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). In these Israel was to consecrate its life daily unto the Lord (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> and 2). In order that the whole of the daily life might be included, it was to be offered continually every morning and evening for all future time ("throughout your generations" as at <a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>) at the door of the tabernacle, i.e., upon the altar erected there, before Jehovah, who would meet with the people and commune with them there (see <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). This promise is carried out still further in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43-46</a>. First of all, for the purpose of elucidating and strengthening the words, "I will meet with you there" (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>), the presence and communion of God, which are attached to the ark of the covenant in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>, are ensured to the whole nation in the words, "And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and it (Israel) shall be sanctified through My glory." As the people were not allowed to approach the ark of the covenant, but only to draw near to the altar of burnt-offering in the sanctuary, it was important to declare that the Lord would manifest Himself to them even there, and sanctify them by His glory. Most of the commentators have taken the altar to be the subject of "shall be sanctified;" but this is certainly an error, not only because the altar is not mentioned in the previous clause, and only slightly hinted at in the &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-41.htm">Exodus 29:41</a>, but principally because the sanctification of the altar is noticed by itself afterwards in <a href="/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>. The correct exegesis is that adopted by Baumgarten and others, who supply the word Israel (viz., regarded as a nation), which they take from the expression "children of Israel" in the previous clause. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>, the sanctification of the tabernacle and altar on the part of God is promised, also that of His servants, and finally, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-46.htm">Exodus 29:46</a>, the abode of God in the midst of the children of Israel, with an allusion to the blessings that would follow from Jehovah's dwelling in the midst of them as their God (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). </body></html>
