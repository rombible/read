The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every Israelite stood in one and the same relation to Yahweh.

When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;Moses did so twice, and doubtless observed the law here prescribed. The tax was not levied from women, minors, old men (Nu 1:42, 45), and the Levites (Nu 1:47), they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost that was exacted from our Lord (Mt 17:24-27), and it was usually devoted to repairs and other purposes connected with the services of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was partly to teach them that all souls are of equal worth in themselves and price with God; that there is no respect of persons with God, and in God’s worship and service, but gospel graces, ordinances, and privileges are common and equal to all, <span class="bld"> Exo 12 16:18 <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a> <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a></span>; that all persons are alike obnoxious to Divine justice, and are redeemed by one and the same price: partly to check the arrogance and vanity of the rich, who are very apt to despise the poor; and partly that by this means the number of the people might be exactly known when occasion required it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel,.... Which shows that the Israelites were alike in the esteem of God, their worldly circumstances making no difference; their souls being alike, the same ransom price was given for them; and that they were all to have an equal share in the service and sanctuary of God, and the price was set so low, that the poorest man might be able to pay it: and even Maimonides (y) says, if he lived on alms, he was to beg it of others, or sell his clothes from off his back to pay it. This shows the equality of the redeemed and ransomed of the Lord; for though some sins and sinners are greater than others, and some are redeemed from more sins than others, yet all sins being infinite, as committed against an infinite God, but one price is paid for all, and that is the precious blood of Christ, the Son of God, an infinite and divine Person; hence all the ransomed ones have the same faith, righteousness, salvation, and eternal life: <p>when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make atonement for your souls; which have sinned, are liable to death for it, are the more excellent part of men, and require a great price for the redemption and ransom of them; and hence it is so great a blessing to be ransomed, because it is the ransom of the soul: and such is the efficacy of Christ's ransom, that it is a full atonement for the souls of men, and their sins, and completely delivers from sin, Satan, the law, death, and hell. <p>(y) Hilchot Shekalim, c. 1. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when <i>they</i> give an offering unto the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> to make an atonement for your souls.</span><p>(i) That God should be merciful to you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

The payment was "the ransom of a soul" (ver. 12) - an acknowledgment of God's mercy in sparing those whose life was justly forfeit. As each soul that he has created is equally precious in his sight, and as he designs equally the salvation of all  - it was fitting that the same exact sum should be paid in every case. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Upon this altar Aaron was to burn fragrant incense, the preparation of which is described in <a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>., every morning and evening before Jehovah, at the time when he trimmed the lamps. No "strange incense" was to be offered upon it, - i.e., incense which Jehovah had not appointed (cf. <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>), that is to say, which had not been prepared according to His instructions-nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat-offering; and no drink-offering was to be poured upon it. As the altar of incense was not only marked as a place of sacrifice by its name &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "place of slain-offering," but was put on a par with the altar of sacrifice by its square shape and its horns, it was important to describe minutely what sacrifices were to be offered upon it. For the burning of fragrant incense is shown to be a sacrifice, by the fact that it was offered upon a place of sacrifice, or altar. Moreover the word &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;, to cause to ascend in smoke and steam, from &#1511;&#1496;&#1512; to smoke or steam, is not only applied to the lighting of incense, but also to the lighting and burning of the bleeding and bloodless sacrifices upon the altar of incense. Lastly, the connection between the incense-offering and the burnt-offering is indicated by the rule that they were to be offered at the same time. Both offerings shadowed forth the devotion of Israel to its God, whilst the fact that they were offered every day exhibited this devotion as constant and uninterrupted. But the distinction between them consisted in this, that in the burnt or whole offering Israel consecrated and sanctified its whole life and action in both body and soul to the Lord, whilst in the incense-offering its prayer was embodied as the exaltation of the spiritual man to God (cf. <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>); and with this there was associated the still further distinction, that the devotion was completed in the burnt-offering solely upon the basis of the atoning sprinkling of blood, whereas the incense-offering presupposed reconciliation with God, and on the basis of this the soul rose to God in this embodiment of its prayer, and was thus absorbed into His Spirit. In this respect, the incense-offering was not only a spiritualizing and transfiguring of the burnt-offering, but a completion of that offering also.</body></html>
