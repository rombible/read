Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet at this laver, every time they went in to minister. This was to teach them purity in all their services, and to dread the pollution of sin. They must not only wash and be made clean, when first made priests, but must wash and be kept clean, whenever they went to minister. It teaches us daily to attend upon God, daily to renew our repentance for sin, and our looking to the blood of Christ for remission; for in many things we daily offend.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>. The bronze for the "Laver of brass" and its foot was supplied from the bronze mirrors of the women who voluntarily gave up these articles of luxury. Bronze mirrors were much used by the ancient Egyptians. No hint is given as to the form of the laver. The brazen sea and the ten lavers that served the same purpose in the temple of Solomon, were elaborately worked in artistic designs and are minutely described <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-29</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-16. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;Moses did so twice, and doubtless observed the law here prescribed. The tax was not levied from women, minors, old men (Nu 1:42, 45), and the Levites (Nu 1:47), they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost that was exacted from our Lord (Mt 17:24-27), and it was usually devoted to repairs and other purposes connected with the services of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The frequent repetition of this phrase, and the shortness of these discourses, in comparison of the length of the forty days, show that God did not deliver all these laws and prescriptions at one time, but successively at several times, possibly upon the sabbath days. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

This was for the priests to wash their hands and feet in, before entering into the Tent of Meeting, or offering sacrifice: it was to stand in the court, in front of the Tent of Meeting, between it and the (bronze) altar. The shape and dimensions of this laver are not prescribed. In Solomon’s Temple there were ten lavers, each of large size, for the same purpose (<a href="/1_kings/7-38.htm" title="Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and on every one of the ten bases one laver.">1 Kings 7:38</a> f.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-21.</span> - THE BRAZEN LAVER. That the tabernacle was to have an ample supply of water had been implied in the directions given for the washing of Aaron and his sons at its outer door (<a href="/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>). That it would contain some provision of the kind is further indicated by the command to "wash the inwards" of victims (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 17). We have now, in this place, the special directions given to Moses on the subject. He was to provide a brazen, or rather a bronze laver, which was to stand on a separate "foot," or base, of bronze, in the court of the tabernacle, between the entrance to the tabernacle and the "brazen  altar." This was to be kept constantly supplied with water, and was to furnish whatever might be needed for the various ceremonies. Among its other uses, it was to supply liquid for the constant ablution of the priests, who were to wash both their hands and their feet on every occasion of their entering the sacred tent, and even on every occasion of their ministering at the brazen altar (ver. 20). This law was to be "a statute for ever" (ver. 21), and its violation was to be punished by death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Atonement-Money, which every Israelite had to pay at the numbering of the people, has the first place among the supplementary instructions concerning the erection and furnishing of the sanctuary, and serves to complete the demand for freewill-offerings for the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1-9</a>).</body></html>
