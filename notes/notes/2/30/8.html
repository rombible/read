The continual intercession of Christ was represented by the daily burning of incense thereon, morning and evening.

Moses was directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered, two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), and to plate it with pure gold, the roof (&#1490;&#1468;&#1490;) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface, which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns; so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, <a href="/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>).
