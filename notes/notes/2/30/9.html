Moses was directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered, two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), and to plate it with pure gold, the roof (&#1490;&#1468;&#1490;) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface, which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns; so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, <a href="/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>).
