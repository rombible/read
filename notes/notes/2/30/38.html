To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-38. the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices&#8212;These were:<p>stacte&#8212;the finest myrrh;<p>onycha&#8212;supposed to be an odoriferous shell;<p>galbanum&#8212;a gum resin from an umbelliferous plant.<p>frankincense&#8212;a dry, resinous, aromatic gum, of a yellow color, which comes from a tree in Arabia, and is obtained by incision of the bark. This incense was placed within the sanctuary, to be at hand when the priest required to burn on the altar. The art of compounding unguents and perfumes was well known in Egypt, where sweet-scented spices were extensively used not only in common life, but in the ritual of the temples. Most of the ingredients here mentioned have been found on minute examination of mummies and other Egyptian relics; and the Israelites, therefore, would have the best opportunities of acquiring in that country the skill in pounding and mixing them which they were called to exercise in the service of the tabernacle. But the recipe for the incense as well as for the oil in the tabernacle, though it receives illustration from the customs of Egypt, was peculiar, and being prescribed by divine authority, was to be applied to no common or inferior purpose.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto,....

Brit.</span> ed. 9, xii. 718). On Egyptian monuments the references to incense are numerous (Wilk.-B. iii. 398 f., with illustr. of censers,—bronze cups supported by long handles); large quantities of it were consumed in the temples (Erman, 300 f.,—with fabulous figures); and expeditions were constantly sent to the land of ‘Punt’ (Somali) to procure fragrant gums (<span class="ital">ibid.</span> 505–514). Plutarch (<span class="ital">de Isid. et Osir.</span> p. 383) describes the Eg. perfume called <span class="ital">kyphi</span>, which was used both for the toilet and as incense, consisting of sixteen ingredients (Erm. 232; Wilk.-B. iii. 398). There are also many references to incense (<span class="ital">ḳuṭrinnu</span>; cf. Heb. <span class="ital">ḳeṭôreth</span>) in Ass. and Bab. inscriptions. The use is also often alluded to by the classical writers. See further Incense in <span class="ital">EB.</span>; or, most fully, Atchley, <span class="ital">Hist. of the use of Incense in Divine worship</span> (1909), pp. 1–77 (on the pre- and non-Christian use of it).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The origin of this use of incense is uncertain. The Oriental has a partiality for aromatic odours: he enjoys them himself; he perfumes his person, his garments, and his house with them; and he offers them to guests and rulers whom he desires to honour (<span class="ital">DB.</span> ii. 468a; Lane, <span class="ital">Mod. Eg.</span> i. 175, 256: cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-17.htm" title="I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.">Proverbs 7:17</a>, <a href="/songs/3-6.htm" title="Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm" title="Kings' daughters were among your honorable women: on your right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.">Psalm 45:9</a>). Men naturally believe that what is grateful to themselves is also pleasing to the deity. If, however, the use of incense originated in a primitive, or semi-primitive people, another motive may have contributed to its adoption: it may have been regarded as a means of driving away evil spirits (cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/6-7.htm" title="And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.">Tob 6:7</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/8-2.htm" title="And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.">Tob 8:2</a> f.) from the precincts of a sanctuary. Cf. Atchley, pp. 61–77. In <a href="/numbers/16-46.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.">Numbers 16:46</a> P (cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-21.htm" title="For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant.">Wis 18:21</a>) an atoning efficacy is attributed to the burning of incense. And in later times incense, rising heavenwards in a cloud, came to be regarded as a spiritual symbol of prayer (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a> f., <a href="/exodus/5-8.htm" title="And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.">Exodus 5:8</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(see at <a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>.). This anointing oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>), and forbade for all time, on pain of death (<a href="/exodus/30-31.htm">Exodus 30:31</a>), not only the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body (<a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>).
