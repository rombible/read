Incense, as commonly used in the ancient world, was not a composition, but some single spice, most frequently frankincense. That, however, employed by the Hebrews was always a compound. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Bell. Jud., </span>v. 5, § 5), the incense burnt in the later temple contained thirteen ingredients.<p><span class= "bld">Stacte </span>is probably the gum storax, which is the produce of the <span class= "ital">styrax officinalis, </span>a tree common in Syria and Palestine. It burns readily, and emits much smoke (Herod. iii. 107).<p><span class= "bld">Onycha </span>is thought to be the “claw” or <span class= "ital">operculum </span>of the <span class= "ital">unguis odoratus, </span>or <span class= "ital">blatta Byzantina, </span>a sort of shell-fish common in the Red Sea. This “claw” produces, when burnt, a strong odour.<p><span class= "bld">Galbanum </span>is a gum well known to modern chemists. It may be procured from various plants, as the <span class= "ital">opoidia galbanifera, </span>the <span class= "ital">galbanum Persicum, </span>and others. When burnt, this gum has a strong pungent odour, which is said to be disagreeable in itself, but to bring out and prolong the scent of other spices (Plin. <span class= "ital">H. N., xii.</span> 54).<p><span class= "bld">Frankincense </span>was probably the main element of the “holy incense,” as it is of such incense as is burnt in modern times. It is a gum or resin obtained from incisions in the bark of the <span class= "ital">arbor thuris, </span>or frankincense-tree, which grows abundantly in India, and in the islands of the Indian archipelago. Anciently, the tree appears to have grown also in Arabia, whence the Egyptians (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. x., pp. 14-17), the Phœnicians, the Hebrews (<a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>), and the Greeks obtained it in large quantities. The odour is very peculiar, and to most persons very agreeable. In England it is best known as the scent given out by the pastilles which are burnt in sick rooms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/30-34.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take to you sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:">Exodus 30:34</a></span>. The incense which was burned upon the golden altar was prepared of <span class="ital">sweet spices </span>likewise, though not so rare and rich as those which the anointing oil was compounded of. This was prepared once a year, (the Jews say,) a pound for each day of the year, and three pounds over for the day of atonement.

To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="/exodus/37-29.htm">Exodus 37:29</a>. The incense, like the anointing oil, consisted of four aromatic ingredients.<p>Stacte - supposed to be either the gum of the Storax tree (Styrax officinale) found in Syria and the neighboring countries, or the gum known as Benzoin, or Gum Benjamin, which is an important ingredient in the incense now used in churches and mosques, and is the produce of another storax tree (Styrax benzoin) that grows in Java and Sumatra.<p>Onycha - , a perfume perhaps made from the cap of the strombus, or wing-shell, which abounds in the Red Sea.<p>Galbanum - , a gum of a yellowish brown color, in the form of either grains or masses. It is imported from India, Persia, and Africa; but the plant from which it comes is not yet certainly known.<p>Pure frankincense - This was the most important of the aromatic gums. Like myrrh, it was regarded by itself as a precious perfume Sol 3:6; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>, and it was used unmixed with other substances in some of the rites of the law. The tree from which it is obtained is not found in Arabia, and it was most likely imported from India by the Sabaeans, like Cinnamon, Cassia, and Calamus (see <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>). The tree is now known as the Boswellia serrata, or B. thurifera, and grows abundantly in the highlands of India. The frankincense of commerce is a different substance, the resin of the spruce and of some other kinds of fir.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-38. the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices&#8212;These were:<p>stacte&#8212;the finest myrrh;<p>onycha&#8212;supposed to be an odoriferous shell;<p>galbanum&#8212;a gum resin from an umbelliferous plant.<p>frankincense&#8212;a dry, resinous, aromatic gum, of a yellow color, which comes from a tree in Arabia, and is obtained by incision of the bark. This incense was placed within the sanctuary, to be at hand when the priest required to burn on the altar. The art of compounding unguents and perfumes was well known in Egypt, where sweet-scented spices were extensively used not only in common life, but in the ritual of the temples. Most of the ingredients here mentioned have been found on minute examination of mummies and other Egyptian relics; and the Israelites, therefore, would have the best opportunities of acquiring in that country the skill in pounding and mixing them which they were called to exercise in the service of the tabernacle. But the recipe for the incense as well as for the oil in the tabernacle, though it receives illustration from the customs of Egypt, was peculiar, and being prescribed by divine authority, was to be applied to no common or inferior purpose.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stacte, and onycha, and galbanum</span>: the Jews themselves are not agreed what these were, and it concerns not Christians much to know, the use of them being abolished.

In a continued discourse, or some time after the former, though more probably at the same time; since it concerns the incense to be offered on the altar of incense, about which directions are given in the former part of the chapter: <p>take unto thee sweet spices: which are as follow, "stacte", "onycha", and "galbanum"; the former of these has its name from dropping; and of the same signification is the Hebrew word "Nataph", here used. Pancirollus says (a), myrrh is a drop or tear distilling from a tree in Arabia Felix; and stacte is a drop of myrrh, which is extracted from it, and yields a most precious liquor: and so Pliny (b) relates, that myrrh trees sweat out of their own accord, before they are cut, what is called stacte, to which nothing is preferable: though some naturalists, as Theophrastus and Dioscorides (c) speak of this as flowing from it when it is cut; however, all agree it is a liquor that drops from myrrh; though the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem interpret it "balsam" or "rosin"; as does Jarchi on the place, and Maimonides (d): the second of these, "onycha", has its name from being of the colour of a man's nail, as the onyx stone is, and is the same with the "unguis odorata" or "blatta byzantia". Jarchi says it is the root of a spice, smooth and shining like a man's nail. It is by some"understood of "laudanum" or "balellium"; but the greatest part of commentators explain it by the "onyx", or the odoriferous shell, which is a shell like to that of the shell fish called "purpura": the onyx is fished for in watery places of the Indies, where grows the "spica nardi", which is the food of this fish, and what makes its shell so aromatic: they go to gather these shells when the heat has dried up the marshes. The best onyx is found in the Red sea, and is white and large, the Babylonian is black and smaller; this is what Dioscorides says of it (e).''And the best being found in the Red sea, it may be reasonably supposed it was what Moses was bid to take. In all India, it is the principal thing in all perfumes, as the aloe is in pills (f); the Targum of Jonathan interprets it by "costus"; and the Jerusalem Targum by spike of myrrh, meaning perhaps spikenard. The last of these, "galbanum", what now goes by that name, is of a very ill smell, and therefore cannot be thought to be one of these sweet spices; but another is meant, and which, by its name "Chelbanah", was of a fat and unctuous nature; though Jarchi says, galbanum, whose smell is ill, is put among the spices; and Maimonides (g) and Kimchi (h) describe it like black honey, and of an offensive smell; but it must be something odoriferous, and therefore most likely to be the galbanum Pliny (i) speaks of as growing on Mount Areanus in Syria, which he mentions along with several sorts of balsams, and as a sort of frankincense; and the Vulgate Latin version, to distinguish it, calls it "galbanum" of a "good smell": <p>these sweet spices with pure frankincense; for which Sabaea in Arabia Felix was very famous, and was called the thuriferous country, as Pliny (k) says; who observes that there were in it two times of gathering the frankincense, the one in autumn, that which was white, and the purest, the other in the spring, which was reddish, and not to be compared with the former: <p>of each shall there be a like weight; just as much of one as of the other: in the Hebrew text it is, "alone by alone"; and the sense may be, that each spice was beaten alone, and after that mixed, as Aben Ezra, or weighed alone, and then put together. <p>(a) Rer.

Some fragrant oil or resin is evidently meant; it is uncertain what. ‘Stacté’ is a transliteration of LXX. <span class="greekheb">στακτη</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">stacte</span>, meaning also something that <span class="ital">drips</span> or <span class="ital">trickles</span>. Stacte was the Gk. and Lat. name of a very fragrant and costly kind of myrrh (<span class="greekheb">σμύρνα</span>), variously described by the ancients as an oil ‘dripping’ from crushed myrrh, either alone (Theophr. <span class="ital">Odor.</span> 29; on the text, see Schneider’s note: cf. Diosc. i. 77) or mixed with a little water (Diosc. i. 73), or as prepared from crushed myrrh dissolved in oil (Theophr. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>), or as exuding spontaneously from the tree (Plin. <span class="ital">H.N.</span> xii. 15, § 68). <span class="bld">Myrrh-oil</span> would be a clearer rend. Lucr. (ii. 847) mentions the ‘blandum stactaeque liquorem’; and Plautus (<span class="ital">Truc.</span> ii. 5, 23) speaks of it as burnt on the altar to Lucina. This rend, of LXX. seems probable: still we do not <span class="ital">know</span> that it is right: it may be founded merely on the agreement of meaning between <span class="ital">nâṭâph</span> and ‘stacte.’ Ges. (<span class="ital">Thes.</span>) identified <span class="ital">nâṭâph</span> with the gum of the storax tree (<span class="ital">NHB.</span> 395 f.), a beautiful perfumed shrub, abundant on the lower hills of Palestine, the gum of which (Diosc. i. 79) is still used in Syria as a perfume. The Rabbis identified it with <span class="ital">ẓŏri</span> (EVV. ‘balm’), and said that it was so called because it ‘dripped’ from the tree called <span class="ital">ḳeṭâph</span>, i.e. (Kimchi, <span class="ital">Book of Roots</span>, s.v.) the <span class="ital">balsam</span>-tree: hence, no doubt, RVm. <span class="ital">opobalsamum</span> (‘juice-balsam,’ as opposed to <span class="ital">xylobalsamum</span>, ‘wood-balsam,’ the scented <span class="ital">twigs</span> of the balsam-tree), an aromatic gum obtained (Diosc. i. 18; Plin. <span class="ital">H.N.</span> xii. 25, § 116, cf. § 118) from the Judaean balsam-tree by incisions in the bark. If however the <span class="ital">môr</span> of <span class="ital">v.</span> 23 (see the note there) was really the juice or gum of the balsam-tree, it is hardly likely to have been called here by a different name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">onycha</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">sheḥçleth</span>†; LXX. <span class="greekheb">ὄνυξ</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">onyx</span>, whence EVV. <span class="ital">onycha</span> (cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/24-15.htm" title="I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.">Sir 24:15</a>); i.e. <span class="ital">unguis odoratus</span>, the ‘operculum,’ or closing flap, called <span class="greekheb">ὄνυξ</span> from its resemblance to the <span class="ital">nail</span>, of certain molluscs, which, when burnt, emits a strong aromatic odour1[214]. Onycha is still gathered along the coasts of the Red Sea; and is largely used as an ingredient in the perfumery of Arab women (<span class="ital">EB.</span> s.v.); it is also said to be the principal component of incense in India and elsewhere (Kn.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[214] Cf.

The epithet <span class="ital">pure</span>, or better, <span class="bld">clear</span> (<span class="ital">zakkâh</span>; LXX. <span class="greekheb">διαφανῆ</span>), is meant probably to denote the superior kind called by Theophr. (ix. 4) <span class="greekheb">καθαρὸν καὶ διαφανῆ</span>, ‘pure and transparent,’ and said by Pliny (xii. 32) to be that gathered in autumn. Knobel states that he had some incense prepared according to this receipt in the laboratory of a colleague at Giessen, and that its odour was ‘strong, refreshing, and very agreeable.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">34–38</span>.

Incense of the same composition to be used for no other purpose.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-38.</span> - THE HOLY INCENSE. It remained to give directions concerning the composition of the incense, which, according to verse 7, was to be burnt upon the altar of gold. That it was to be of one and one only peculiar kind had been already implied in the prohibition to burn "strange incense" (ver. 9). Moses is now told exactly how it was to be composed. As the oil was to contain four spices, so was the incense to be made of a like number - stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense - of each the same quantity (ver. 34). The art of the apothecary was to be called in for making it up (ver. 35). A portion of it was to be "beaten very small," and placed in front of the ark of the covenant, probably on the golden altar outside the vail (ver. 36). A prohibition is added, similar to that given with respect to the holy oil: no one is to make any like it for private use, under pain of being "cut off from his people" (vers. 37, 38). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take unto thee sweet spices.</span> Rather, "Take unto thee spices," or "perfumes." The word has no epithet. <span class="cmt_word">Stacte.</span> The Hebrew word used means simply "a drop" (Job 32:27), and might be applied to any gum or resin which exuded from a tree. We have no clue to the gum here intended but that which is furnished by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, which our translators have followed. Now the Greeks seem to have called two gums by this name - one, the natural exudation from the myrrh tree, called above (ver. 23) "pure myrrh," or "the myrrh that flows freely;" and the other gum storax. As it is not likely that the same substance has been given two  names within the space of ten verses, we must suppose the latter to be meant. Gum storax is the produce of a tree allied to the poplar, and known as <span class="accented">Styrax officinalis</span>, which grows abundantly in Syria and Palestine. It was frequently used as a perfume by the ancients (Herod. 3:107; Plin. <span class="accented">H</span>. <span class="accented">N</span>. 12:17, &sect;40). <span class="cmt_word">Onycha</span>. The Hebrew word, <span class="accented">she-kheleth</span>, seems to mean a "shell" of some kind or other. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, Lat. onycha, was applied to the <span class="accented">operculum</span> - the "nail" or "claw" - of certain shell-fish of the genus Strombidae, which were common in the lied Sea, and elsewhere. The particular <span class="accented">strombus</span> which furnishes the onycha of the ancients is thought to have been the <span class="accented">Unguis odoratus</span> or <span class="accented">Blatta Byzantina</span>. The <span class="accented">opercula</span> of these shell-fish have, when burnt, a strong odour, "something like castoreum." The onycha is, again coupled with galbanum and gum storax in Ecclesiates 24:15. Galbanum. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">khelb'nah</span>, is so near the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">galbanum</span> that it has with good reason been assumed to designate the same substance. Galbanum is a gum well known both to ancients and moderns. It is admitted into the pharmacopeia. Several plants seem to produce it, as the <span class="accented">Opoidia galbanifera</span>, the <span class="accented">Galbanum Persicum</span>, and a plant which grows in Northern Persia, very like the Ferula erubeseens. When burnt, <span class="accented">galbanum</span> has a strong pungent odour, which is said to be disagreeable by itself, but to improve and preserve other odours (Plin. <span class="accented">H</span>. <span class="accented">N</span>. 12:54). <span class="cmt_word">Frankincense</span>. On the wide use of frankincense, see the comment on ver. 1. It was the produce of a tree which anciently flourished in Arabia, but which appears to have degenerated, and now produces only an inferior quality. The best frankincense comes now from the high lands of India. It exudes from a tree called salai (the <span class="accented">Boswellia setrata</span> or <span class="accented">thurifera</span> of botanists). Some think that the frankincense exported largely from Arabia to the neighbouring nations was in part the produce of this tree imported by the Arab merchants from Hindustan. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(see at <a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>.). This anointing oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>), and forbade for all time, on pain of death (<a href="/exodus/30-31.htm">Exodus 30:31</a>), not only the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body (<a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>). "Man," i.e., the ordinary man in distinction from the priests. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; according to its measure, i.e., according to the proportions prescribed for its manufacture. &#1494;&#1512; (<a href="/exodus/30-33.htm">Exodus 30:33</a>) a stranger, is not only the non-Israelite, but laymen or non-priests in general. On the expression, "cut off from his people," see at <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>. </body></html>
