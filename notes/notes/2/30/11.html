The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Ransom of Souls. - <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25-28</a>. On comparing these words with those of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-3</a>, we may perhaps infer that the first passage relates to a mere counting of the adult Israelites at the time when the money was taken from each, and that what the latter passage enjoins was a formal enrolment of them according to their genealogies and their order of military service.<p>A ransom for his soul - What the sincere worshipper thus paid was at once the fruit and the sign of his faith in the goodness of Yahweh, who had redeemed him and brought him into the covenant. Hence, the payment is rightly called a ransom inasmuch as it involved a personal appropriation of the fact of his redemption.

When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;Moses did so twice, and doubtless observed the law here prescribed. The tax was not levied from women, minors, old men (Nu 1:42, 45), and the Levites (Nu 1:47), they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost that was exacted from our Lord (Mt 17:24-27), and it was usually devoted to repairs and other purposes connected with the services of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

The various commands given with respect to the tabernacle and its furniture would necessarily involve a very considerable outlay; and it was important that Moses should receive directions as to the source, or sources, whence this expenditure was to come. In <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2-7</a>, one source had been indicated, viz., the voluntary contributions of the people. To this is now added a second source. On occasion of rite numbering of the people - an event which is spoken of as impending (ver. 12) - Moses was told to exact from each of them, as atonement money, the sum of half a shekel of silver. The produce of this tax was to be applied to the work of the sanctuary (ver. 16), and it is found to have formed an important clement in the provision for the cost, since the total amount was above a hundred talents, or, more exactly, 301,775 shekels (<a href="/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25</a>). The requirement of atonement money seems to have been based on the idea, that formal enrolment in the number of God's faithful people necessarily brought home to every man his unworthiness to belong to that holy company, and so made him feel the need of making atonement in some way or other. The payment of the half-shekel was appointed as the legal mode under those circumstances. It was an acknowledgment of sin, equally binding upon all, and so made equal for all; and it saved from God's vengeance those who, if they had boon too proud to make it, would have been punished by some "plague" or other (ver. 12). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Altar of Incense and Incense-Offering bring the directions concerning the sanctuary to a close. What follows, from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-31:17</a>, is shown to be merely supplementary to the larger whole by the formula "and Jehovah spake unto Moses," with which every separate command is introduced (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-6</a><p>(cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/37-25.htm">Exodus 37:25-28</a>). Moses was directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered, two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), and to plate it with pure gold, the roof (&#1490;&#1468;&#1490;) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface, which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns; so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, <a href="/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). Moreover it was to be ornamented with a golden wreath, and furnished with golden rings at the corners for the carrying-poles, as the ark of the covenant and the table of shew-bread were (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>., <a href="/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a>.); and its place was to be in front of the curtain, which concealed the ark of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), "before the capporeth" (<a href="/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>), so that, although it really stood in the holy place between the candlestick on the south side and the table on the north (<a href="/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm">Exodus 40:22</a>, <a href="/exodus/40-24.htm">Exodus 40:24</a>), it was placed in the closest relation to the capporeth, and for this reason is not only connected with the most holy place in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, but is reckoned in <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a> as part of the furniture of the most holy place (see Delitzsch on <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).</body></html>
