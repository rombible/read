To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An oil of holy ointment - Rather, a holy anointing oil.<p>After the art of the apothecary - According to Jewish tradition, the essences of the spices were first extracted, and then mixed with the oil.

The spices were, (1) liquid myrrh, as distinguished from the dry gum; - (2) &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, cinnamon of fragrance, the name having been introduced to the Semitic nations along with the thing itself, and then by the Phoenicians to the Greeks and Romans (&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, cinnamum): whether it came from Ceylon, the great mart of cinnamon, is very doubtful, as there is not word that can be discovered in the Indian dialects corresponding to cinnamon; - (3) cane of fragrance, the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, calamus odoratus, of the Greek sand Romans, i.e., the scented calamus which is imported from India; - and (4) kiddah, probably cassia, and possibly the species called &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769; in Dioscor. 1, 12, in which case &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>) is either the generic name for cassia, or else refers to a different species. The proportion in which these spices were to be taken was 500 shekels or 14 1/2 lbs. of myrrh, half the quantity, i.e., 7 lbs, of cinnamon, and the same of calamus and cassia; in all, therefore, 21 lbs. of dry spices, which were to be mixed with one hin of oil (about 5 quarts) and 14 lbs. of liquid myrrh. These proportions preclude the supposition, that the spices were pulverized and mixed with the oil and myrrh in their natural condition, for the result in that case would have been a thick mess: they rather favour the statement of the Rabbins, that the dry spices were softened in water and boiled, to extract their essence, which was then mixed with oil and myrrh, and boiled again until all the watery part had evaporated. An artificial production of this kind is also indicated by the expressions &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; &#1512;&#1511;&#1495; "spice-work of spice-mixture," and &#1512;&#1511;&#1495; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; "labour (work) of the perfumer or ointment-maker." </body></html>
