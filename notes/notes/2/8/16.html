(16, 17)</span><p>It is disputed whether this plague was one of lice or of mosquitoes. Josephus and the Jewish commentators generally take the former view, while the latter is supported by the LXX. and Vulgate, by the authorities of Philo, Artapanus, Origen, and St. Augustine in ancient, and by those of Rosenmüller, Michaelis, Œdmann, Gesenius, Keil, and Kalisch in modern times. The word used (<span class= "ital">kinnim</span>) seems connected with the Greek <span class= "greekheb">κίνψ</span>, or <span class= "greekheb">κώνωψ</span>, and is reasonably regarded as formed by <span class= "ital">onomatopoeia,</span> from the sharp tingling sound given out by the insect when on the wing.<span class= "note">[58]</span> The trouble caused to the Egyptians of the Delta by mosquitoes is noticed by Herodotus (ii. 95); while moderns, as Forskal (<span class= "ital">Descript. Anim.</span> p. 85), declare that they amount to an absolute pest at certain seasons. They are most troublesome towards October, and are said to attack not only the exposed parts of the skin, but especially the ears, the nostrils, and the eyes, where they do great damage. Some have thought that mosquitoes do not molest cattle (<a href="/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>); but Kalisch says, “They molest <span class= "ital">especially</span> beasts, as oxen and horses, flying into their eyes and nostrils, driving them to madness and fury, and sometimes even torturing them to death.”<p><span class= "note">[58] In Egyptian the word for “mosquito” is <span class= "ital">Khnemms,</span> (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">Diet. Hierogl.</span> p. 1103).</span><p>It is to be noticed that the third plague, whatever it was, came without warning. It was God’s judgment on Pharaoh for hardening his heart and breaking his promise (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>); and he was not given the option of avoiding it by submission to God’s will.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Smite the dust of the land.</span>—Dust prevails in Egypt to an extent that is highly inconvenient. “We travelled to Ashmim.” says one writer, “through clouds of dust, raised by a high wind, which intercepted our view as much as if we had been travelling in a fog.” “There is one great source of discomfort,” says another, “arising from the dryness of the atmosphere, namely, an excessive quantity of dust.” When “all the dust of the land became mosquitoes” (<a href="/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>), the plague must indeed have been great.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-19 These lice were produced out of the dust of the earth; out of any part of the creation God can fetch a scourge, with which to correct those who rebel against him. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. These lice were very troublesome, as well as disgraceful to the Egyptians, whose priests were obliged to take much pains that no vermin ever should be found about them. All the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, had reference to their national crimes, or were rendered particularly severe by their customs. The magicians attempted to imitate it, but they could not. It forced them to confess, This is the finger of God! The check and restraint put upon us, must needs be from a Divine power. Sooner or later God will force even his enemies to acknowledge his own power.

This fell on the earth, which was worshipped in Egypt as the father of the gods. An special sacredness was attached to the black fertile soil of the basin of the Nile, called Chemi, from which the ancient name of Egypt is supposed to be derived.<p>Lice - The Hebrew word occurs only in connection with this plague. These insects are generally identified with mosquitos, a plague nowhere greater than in Egypt. They are most troublesome toward October, i. e. soon after the plague of frogs, and are dreaded not only for the pain and annoyance which they cause, but also because they are said to penetrate into the body through the nostrils and ears. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 8:16-19.

In ordinary circumstances they embitter life in Eastern countries, and therefore the terrible nature of this infliction on Egypt may be imagined when no precautions could preserve from their painful sting. The very smallness and insignificance of these fierce insects made them a dreadful scourge. The magicians never attempted any imitation, and what neither the blood of the river nor the nuisance of the frogs had done, the visitation of this tiny enemy constrained them to acknowledge "this is the finger of God"&#8212;properly "gods," for they spoke as heathens.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God, it seems, gave him no warning, because he showed himself in the very last plague to be both perfidious and incorrigible.

Gnats, or, as we should say, <span class="ital">mosquitos</span>, are abundant in Egypt: they are generated from the water (which is full of their larvas); and in the autumn especially, when the Nile is still overflowing, and the rice-fields stand in water, they rise from it in such swarms that the air is sometimes darkened with them. Their sting occasions swelling and irritation; and the annoyance caused by them is often alluded to by travellers in Egypt. Lice, on the other hand, are nothing characteristic of Egypt. Hence most moderns (Ges., Keil, Dillm. &c.) agree that <span class="bld">gnats</span> is the most probable rendering. The gnats in Egypt often look like clouds of dust; accordingly, they are described here as produced from the dust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[121] Philo (<span class="ital">Vit.

The breach of promise on the part of Pharaoh (ver. 15), was punished by the third plague, which was inflicted without being announced. It is disputed among the best critics, whether the plague was really one of "lice"(as given in the Authorised Version) or of mosquitoes. To the present writer the arguments in favour of mosquitoes seem to preponderate; and he believes the <span class="accented">kinnim to</span> represent those subtle pests. Such is the view of the LXX. translators, of Philo, Artapanus, Origen, Rosenmuller, Gesenins, Geddes, Boothroyd, Keil, and Kalisch. Mosquitoes are, under ordinary circumstances, a terrible annoyance in Egypt, when the inundation is going off, especially about October. Their power to annoy is witnessed to in ancient times by Herodotus (2:95), Philo (<span class="accented">Vit. Mos.</span> 2. p. 97), and St. Augustine; in modern by Wilkinson and others. That Aaron was ordered to produce them out of "the dust of the land," whereas mosquitoes come from larvae deposited in stagnant waters (Cook), is only a proof that God can transform any kind of matter into any other. He who made man of the dust of the ground (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) could with still greater ease have transformed that dust into gnats. It is undoubtedly remarkable that the magi-clans could not produce the <span class="accented">kinnim</span>; but this disability does not help us to determine what exactly the <span class="accented">kinnim</span> were. Conceivably, the magicians were tired of the contest, and feeling that they would ultimately be worsted in it, . withdrew before the circumstances compelled them to withdraw. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lice</span>. <span class="accented">Kinnim - the</span> word is only found here and in the Psalms which celebrate the Exodus (<a href="/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>). It was understood as "lice"by Josephus, the Talmudical writers, Bochart, Pool, and our translators in the reign of James I. But the great  weight of authority is in favour of the rendering "<span class="accented">gnats"</span> or "mosquitoes." See the preceding paragraph. It must also be berne in mind that the nearest Egyptian equivalent, <span class="accented">khennems</span>, <span class="accented">has the</span> signification of mosquito (Speaker's <span class="accented">Commentary</span>, vol. 1. p. 490). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king appointed the following day, probably because he hardly thought it possible for so great a work to be performed at once. Moses promised that it should be so: "According to thy word (sc., let it be), that thou mayest know that there is not (a God) like Jehovah our God." He then went out and cried, i.e., called aloud and earnestly, to Jehovah concerning the matter (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;) of the frogs, which he had set, i.e., prepared, for Pharaoh (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). In consequence of his intercession God took the plague away. The frogs died off (&#1502;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to die away out of, from), out of the houses, and palaces, and fields, and were gathered together by bushels (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, the omer, the largest measure used by the Hebrews), so that the land stank with the odour of their putrefaction. Though Jehovah had thus manifested Himself as the Almighty God and Lord of the creation, Pharaoh did not keep his promise; but when he saw that there was breathing-time (&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, relief from an overpowering pressure), literally, as soon as he "got air," he hardened his heart, so that he did not hearken to Moses and Aaron (&#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; inf. abs. as in <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>). </body></html>
