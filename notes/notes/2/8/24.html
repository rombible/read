The Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be marked in the plague of flies. The Lord knows them that are his, and will make it appear, perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set them apart for himself. Pharaoh unwillingly entered into a treaty with Moses and Aaron. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, provided they would do it in the land of Egypt. But it would be an abomination to God, should they offer the Egyptian sacrifices; and it would be an abomination to the Egyptians, should they offer to God the objects of the worship of the Egyptians, namely, their calves or oxen. Those who would offer acceptable sacrifice to God, must separate themselves from the wicked and profane. They must also retire from the world. Israel cannot keep the feast of the Lord, either among the brick-kilns or among the flesh-pots of Egypt. And they must sacrifice as God shall command, not otherwise. Though they were in slavery to Pharaoh, yet they must obey God's commands. Pharaoh consents for them to go into the wilderness, provided they do not go so far but that he might fetch them back again. Thus, some sinners, in a pang of conviction, part with their sins, yet are loth they should go very far away; for when the fright is over, they will turn to them again. Moses promised the removal of this plague. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: if we think to cheat God by a sham repentance and a false surrender of ourselves to him, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. Pharaoh returned to his hardness. Reigning lusts break through the strongest bonds, and make men presume and go from their word. Many seem in earnest, but there is some reserve, some beloved, secret sin. They are unwilling to look upon themselves as in danger of everlasting misery. They will refrain from other sins; they do much, give much, and even punish themselves much. They will leave it off sometimes, and, as it were, let their sin depart a little way; but will not make up their minds to part with all and follow Christ, bearing the cross. Rather than that, they venture all. They are sorrowful, but depart from Christ, determined to keep the world at present, and they hope for some future season, when salvation may be had without such costly sacrifices; but, at length, the poor sinner is driven away in his wickedness, and left without hope to lament his folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will sever ... - This severance constituted a specific difference between this and the preceding plagues.

Rise up early &#8230; Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water, &c.&#8212;Pharaoh still appearing obdurate, Moses was ordered to meet him while walking on the banks of the Nile and repeat his request for the liberation of Israel, threatening in case of continued refusal to cover every house from the palace to the cottage with swarms of flies&#8212;while, as a proof of the power that accomplished this judgment, the land of Goshen should be exempted from the calamity. The appeal was equally vain as before, and the predicted evil overtook the country in the form of what was not "flies," such as we are accustomed to, but divers sorts of flies (Ps 78:45), the gad fly, the cockroach, the Egyptian beetle, for all these are mentioned by different writers. They are very destructive, some of them inflicting severe bites on animals, others destroying clothes, books, plants, every thing. The worship of flies, particularly of the beetle, was a prominent part of the religion of the ancient Egyptians. The employment of these winged deities to chastise them must have been painful and humiliating to the Egyptians while it must at the same time have strengthened the faith of the Israelites in the God of their fathers as the only object of worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord did so, </span> immediately by his own word, and not by Moses’s rod, lest the Egyptians should think it was a magician’s wand, and. that all Moses’s works were done by the power of the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A grievous swarm of flies; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">a heavy mixture</span> of flies. <span class="ital">Heavy</span>, i.e. either great, as this Hebrew word is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/41-31.htm" title="And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.">Genesis 41:31</a> <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm" title="And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.">Isaiah 32:2</a></span>, or mischievous and troublesome; or rather, numerous, as it is taken, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm" title="And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.">Genesis 1:9</a> <a href="/numbers/11-14.htm" title="I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.">Numbers 11:14</a> <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm" title="Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?">1 Kings 3:9</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/1-10.htm" title="Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that is so great?">2 Chronicles 1:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The land, </span> i.e. either the fruits or products of the land; or rather, the inhabitants of the land, as the word <span class="ital">land</span> is taken, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/41-36.htm" title="And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.">Genesis 41:36</a> <a href="/1_samuel/27-9.htm" title="And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.">1 Samuel 27:9</a></span> many of the people were poisoned or stung to death by them, as appears from <a href="/psalms/78-45.htm" title="He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.">Psalm 78:45</a>.

The cause of this inability is hardly to be sought for, as Knobel supposes, in the fact that "the thing to be done in this instance, was to call creatures into existence, and not merely to call forth and change creatures and things in existence already, as in the case of the staff, the water, and the frogs." For after this, they could neither call out the dog-flies, nor protect their own bodies from the boils; to say nothing of the fact, that as gnats proceed from the eggs laid in the dust or earth by the previous generation, their production is not to be regarded as a direct act of creation any more than that of the frogs. The miracle in both plagues was just the same, and consisted not in a direct creation, but simply in a sudden creative generation and supernatural multiplication, not of the gnats only, but also of the frogs, in accordance with a previous prediction. The reason why the arts of the Egyptians magicians were put to shame in this case, we have to seek in the omnipotence of God, restraining the demoniacal powers which the magicians had made subservient to their purposes before, in order that their inability to bring out these, the smallest of all creatures, which seemed to arise as it were from the dust itself, might display in the sight of every one the impotence of their secret arts by the side of the almighty creative power of the true God. This omnipotence the magicians were compelled to admit: they were compelled to acknowledge, "This is the finger of God." "But they did not make this acknowledgment for the purpose of giving glory to God Himself, but simply to protect their own honour, that Moses and Aaron might not be thought to be superior to them in virtue or knowledge. It was equivalent to saying, it is not by Moses and Aaron that we are restrained, but by a divine power, which is greater than either" (Bochart). The word Elohim is decisive in support of this view. If they had meant to refer to the God of Israel, they would have used the name Jehovah. The "finger of God" denotes creative omnipotence (<a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). Consequently this miracle also made no impression upon Pharaoh. </body></html>
