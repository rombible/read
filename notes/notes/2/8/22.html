The “land of Goshen” can only have been some portion of the Eastern Delta, a tract in unwise different from the rest of Egypt—low, flat, well-watered, fertile. Nature had put no severance between it and the regions where the Egyptians dwelt; so the severance to be made would be a manifest miracle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/8-22.htm" title="And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the middle of the earth.">Exodus 8:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will sever in that day — </span>The Hebrew properly means, <span class="ital">I will marvellously sever. </span>The LXX. render it <span class="greekheb">παραδοξασω </span><span class="ital">, I will make a glorious distinction. </span>Although the Israelites were probably not afflicted with any of the plagues which went before this, yet as Goshen, where they lived, was at a considerable distance, it might be thought that the frogs and lice, in the common course of things, considering their nature, would not extend as far; but it being natural to flies to be carried by the air everywhere, this was the more astonishing and distinguishing, that such creatures, whose nature it is to spread themselves in all places, should not any of them extend to the land of Goshen. <span class="ital">Know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth — </span>In every part of it.

The Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be marked in the plague of flies. The Lord knows them that are his, and will make it appear, perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set them apart for himself. Pharaoh unwillingly entered into a treaty with Moses and Aaron. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, provided they would do it in the land of Egypt. But it would be an abomination to God, should they offer the Egyptian sacrifices; and it would be an abomination to the Egyptians, should they offer to God the objects of the worship of the Egyptians, namely, their calves or oxen. Those who would offer acceptable sacrifice to God, must separate themselves from the wicked and profane. They must also retire from the world. Israel cannot keep the feast of the Lord, either among the brick-kilns or among the flesh-pots of Egypt. And they must sacrifice as God shall command, not otherwise. Though they were in slavery to Pharaoh, yet they must obey God's commands. Pharaoh consents for them to go into the wilderness, provided they do not go so far but that he might fetch them back again. Thus, some sinners, in a pang of conviction, part with their sins, yet are loth they should go very far away; for when the fright is over, they will turn to them again. Moses promised the removal of this plague. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: if we think to cheat God by a sham repentance and a false surrender of ourselves to him, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. Pharaoh returned to his hardness. Reigning lusts break through the strongest bonds, and make men presume and go from their word. Many seem in earnest, but there is some reserve, some beloved, secret sin. They are unwilling to look upon themselves as in danger of everlasting misery. They will refrain from other sins; they do much, give much, and even punish themselves much. They will leave it off sometimes, and, as it were, let their sin depart a little way; but will not make up their minds to part with all and follow Christ, bearing the cross. Rather than that, they venture all. They are sorrowful, but depart from Christ, determined to keep the world at present, and they hope for some future season, when salvation may be had without such costly sacrifices; but, at length, the poor sinner is driven away in his wickedness, and left without hope to lament his folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will sever ... - This severance constituted a specific difference between this and the preceding plagues. Pharaoh could not of course attribute the exemption of Goshen from a scourge, which fell on the valley of the Nile, to an Egyptian deity, certainly not to Chepera (see the last note), a special object of worship in Lower Egypt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 8:20-32.

The appeal was equally vain as before, and the predicted evil overtook the country in the form of what was not "flies," such as we are accustomed to, but divers sorts of flies (Ps 78:45), the gad fly, the cockroach, the Egyptian beetle, for all these are mentioned by different writers. They are very destructive, some of them inflicting severe bites on animals, others destroying clothes, books, plants, every thing. The worship of flies, particularly of the beetle, was a prominent part of the religion of the ancient Egyptians. The employment of these winged deities to chastise them must have been painful and humiliating to the Egyptians while it must at the same time have strengthened the faith of the Israelites in the God of their fathers as the only object of worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The site of Goshen has been fixed by recent discoveries. Ancient hieroglyphic lists of the ‘nomes’ of Egypt mention <span class="ital">Kesem</span> as the 20th nome of Lower Egypt, and state that its religious capital was <span class="ital">P-sapṭ</span>, i.e. the modern ‘<span class="ital">Ṣafṭ</span> el-Ḥenna,’ a village about 40 miles NE. of Cairo, the ancient name of which M. Naville ascertained in 1885, from inscriptions found on the spot, to be <span class="ital">Kes</span>. ‘Goshen’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">Γεσεμ</span>) must thus have been the fertile district around Ṣafṭ, where the Wâdy Ṭumîlât opens out at its W. end towards Bubastis, ‘within the triangle lying between the villages of Ṣafṭ, Belbeis, and Tel el-Kebir’ (Naville), embracing an area of 60–80 sq. miles (Petrie, <span class="ital">Sinai</span>, p. 208), about 40–50 miles NE. of Cairo. The Wâdy Ṭumîlât is a narrow strip of cultivated soil stretching out, like an arm from the Delta (see the map), across the desert, about 50 miles NE. of Cairo, to Lake Timsâḥ: in pre-historic times, a branch of the Nile ran down it1[123], discharging its waters into a northern extension of the Gulf of Suez’ (see p. 126); within the historic period canals have been at different times constructed along it, connecting the Nile with the Red Sea (p. 4 <span class="ital">n</span>.); on each side of this strip of soil the country is desert, but the Wâdy itself is irrigated by a fresh water canal, and fertile: and the part of the Delta adjoining it on the W. (where ‘Goshen’ will have been) affords excellent arable land and pasture (cf. Dawson, <span class="ital">Egypt and Syria</span>, p. 55 f.).

The cemetery of Kes was excavated in 1905–6 by Petrie, and found by him to contain numerous tombs of the 18th and 19th dynasties; but the tombs, as the objects found in them shewed, were entirely those of <span class="ital">Egyptians</span>. If, therefore, as J represents (see esp. <a href="/genesis/46-34.htm" title="That you shall say, Your servants' trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.">Genesis 46:34</a>), the Israelites lived <span class="ital">apart</span> from the Egyptians, we must suppose that the Egyptians in Goshen lived only in the <span class="ital">town</span>, while the Israelites were in the country.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to the end … that</span>, &c.] Cf. <a href="/exodus/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To morrow.

On the position of the land of Goshen, see the Excursus on the Geography. The "severance" is a new feature, and one distinguishing the later from the earlier plagues. It was an additional mark of the miraculous character of the visitations, well calculated to impress all thoughtful and honest minds. By all such it would be seen that the God who could make this severance was no local God of the Hebrews only, but one whose power extended over the whole earth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Gnats, or the third plague. - The &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, or &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (also &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, probably an old singular form, Ewald, 163f), were not "lice," but &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, sciniphes, a species of gnats, so small as to be hardly visible to the eye, but with a sting which, according to Philo and Origen, causes a most painful irritation of the skin. They even creep into the eyes and nose, and after the harvest they rise in great swarms from the inundated rice-fields. This plague was caused by the fact that Aaron smote the dust of the ground with his staff, and all the dust throughout the land of Egypt turned into gnats, which were upon man and beast (<a href="/exodus/8-17.htm">Exodus 8:17</a>).
