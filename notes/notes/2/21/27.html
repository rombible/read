It was given to regulate the procedure of the public magistrate in determining the amount of compensation in every case of injury, but did not encourage feelings of private revenge. The later Jews, however, mistook it for a moral precept, and were corrected by our Lord (Mt 5:38-42).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some confine this to the Israelitish servants, but the text doth not so limit it; and the reason of the law seems to reach to Gentile servants, this being a just punishment to unmerciful masters, (who ought to be merciful to their beasts, much more to such servants,) and a fit recompence to a servant for such a loss. And this law reacheth the loss of any other member, these two being instanced in, the one as the chief, and the other as the meanest, to intimate that other parts of a like or middle nature are included. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth,....

And though only these parts are expressed, yet Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe, that all other principal members of the body, which they reckon to be twenty four, are included, as the fingers, toes, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if he smite <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.</span><p>(s) So God revenges cruelty in the even the least things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The case was different with regard to a slave. The master had always the right to punish or "chasten" him with a stick (<a href="/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>); this right was involved in the paternal authority of the master over the servants in his possession. The law was therefore confined to the abuse of this authority in outbursts of passion, in which case, "if the servant or the maid should die under his hand (i.e., under his blows), he was to be punished" (&#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;: "vengeance shall surely be taken"). But in what the &#1504;&#1511;&#1501; was to consist is not explained; certainly not in slaying by the sword, as the Jewish commentators maintain. The lawgiver would have expressed this by &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. No doubt it was left to the authorities to determine this according to the circumstances. The law in <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a> could hardly be applied to a case of this description, although it was afterwards extended to foreigners as well as natives (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-21.htm">Leviticus 24:21-22</a>), for the simple reason, that it is hardly conceivable that a master would intentionally kill his slave, who was his possession and money. How far the lawgiver was from presupposing any such intention here, is evident from the law which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-21.htm">Exodus 21:21</a>, "Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two (i.e., remain alive), it shall not be avenged, for he is his money." By the continuance of his life, if only for a day or two, it would become perfectly evident that the master did not wish to kill his servant; and if nevertheless he died after this, the loss of the slave was punishment enough for the master. There is no ground whatever for restricting this regulation, as the Rabbins do, to slaves who were not of Hebrew extraction.</body></html>
