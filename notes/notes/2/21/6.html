The State must sanction the passing of a citizen into the slave condition, and so the “judges” were called in. The change was to be made by a significant ceremony. In order to mark that henceforth the volunteer bondman became attached to the household, he was to be physically attached to the house by having an awl forced through his ear, and then driven into the door or door-post. Hence “opening the ear” became a synonym for assigning a man to the slave condition in perpetuity (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6</a>).

An Hebrew might be made a slave through poverty, debt, or crime; but at the end of six years he was entitled to freedom, and his wife, if she had voluntarily shared his state of bondage, also obtained release. Should he, however, have married a female slave, she and the children, after the husband's liberation, remained the master's property; and if, through attachment to his family, the Hebrew chose to forfeit his privilege and abide as he was, a formal process was gone through in a public court, and a brand of servitude stamped on his ear (Ps 40:6) for life, or at least till the Jubilee (De 15:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall bring him unto the judges; </span> partly, that it may appear he chooseth this freely, and is not overawed nor overreached by his master; and partly, that the agreement being so publicly and solemnly confirmed, might be irrevocable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall also bring him to the door, </span> to wit, of his master’s house, as it is expressed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever.

To Elohim, to God, to the judgment seat of God, according to the Septuagint; to some person or persons to inquire of God what is to be done in such a case; but this seems needless, since it is here declared: no doubt civil magistrates or judges are meant by Elohim, or the gods, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>, and so Jarchi interprets it of the house of judgment, or sanhedrim, the court that had convicted the servant of theft, and had sold him to him, it was proper he should acquaint them with it, have their opinion about it; and especially it was proper to have him to them, that he might before them, even in open court, declare his willingness to abide in his master's service; and from whom, as the Targum of Jonathan, he was to receive power and authority to retain him in his service: <p>he shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost; either of the gate of the city, where the judges were sitting, before whom what follows was to be done, as Aben Ezra suggests; or rather the door of his master, or any other man's, as Maimonides (l): <p>and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; or with a needle, as the Targum of Jonathan, which also says it was the right ear; and so Jarchi; and the upper part of it, as says Maimonides, who likewise observes, that that with which it is bored must be of metal; and moreover, that it is the master himself that must do it, and not his son, nor his messenger, nor a messenger of the sanhedrim (m): the ear is an hieroglyphic of obedience, and the boring of it through to the doorpost denotes the strict and close obedience of such a servant to his master, and how he is, and ought to be, addicted to his service, and be constantly employed in it, and never stir from it, nor so much as go over the threshold of his master's house. This custom of boring a servant's ear continued in Syria till the times of Juvenal, as appears by some lines of his: (n). <p>and he shall serve him for ever; as long as he lives (o); however, until the year of jubilee, as the Targum of Jonathan, and so Jarchi; if there was one before his death, for nothing else could free him; denoting freedom by Christ in his acceptable year, and day of salvation. <p>(l) Hilchot Abadim, c. 3. sect. 9.

The ear, as the organ of hearing, is naturally that of obedience as well; and its attachment (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>) to the door of the house would signify the perpetual attachment of the slave to that particular household. Probably it was the right ear which was pierced: for the preference shewn for this, comp. <a href="/leviticus/8-23.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.">Leviticus 8:23</a> f., <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm" title="The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.">Exodus 14:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-17.htm" title="And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:17</a>. The connexion ‘bring him to God (<span class="ital">or</span> the gods),’ and ‘bring him to the door’ seems, however, to suggest that both were in the same place: hence, as the ‘door’ of the sanctuary seems out of the question, Bä. and others render <span class="ital">hâ-’ĕlôhîm</span> (as is perfectly possible: cf. <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm" title="For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.">Genesis 3:5</a> RVm.) <span class="ital">by the gods</span>, supposing the reference to be to the household gods, or Penates, of the master’s house, kept and worshipped near the door: the ceremony would then have the effect of bringing the give into a relation of dependence on the gods of his master’s family, and of admitting him to the full religious privileges of the family (cf. Eerdmans <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, Aug. 1909, p. 163 f.).

The explanation ‘till the next jubilee’ (Jos. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> iv. 8. 28, and others), which has been adopted for harmonistic reasons (see <a href="/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:...">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>), is exegetically impossible: as Di. says, the difference between the two laws must be frankly recognized; they spring, it is evident, out of different periods of the history.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For the worship of Jehovah, the God of heaven, Israel needed only an altar, on which to cause its sacrifices to ascend to God. The altar, as an elevation built up of earth or rough stones, was a symbol of the elevation of man to God, who is enthroned on high in the heaven; and because man was to raise himself to God in his sacrifices, Israel also was to make an altar, though only of earth, or if of stones, not of hewn stones. "For if thou swingest thy tool (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; lit., sharpness, then any edge tool) over it (over the stone), thou defilest it" (<a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>). "Of earth:" i.e., not "of comparatively simple materials, such as befitted a representation of the creature" (Schultz on <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a>); for the altar was not to represent the creature, but to be the place to which God came to receive man into His fellowship there. For this reason the altar was to be made of the same material, which formed the earthly soil for the kingdom of God, either of earth or else of stones, just as they existed in their natural state; not, however, "because unpolished stones, which retain their true and native condition, appear to be endowed with a certain native purity, and therefore to be most in harmony with the sanctity of an altar" (Spencer de legg. Hebr. rit. lib. ii. c. 6), for the "native purity" of the earth does not agree with <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; but because the altar was to set forth the nature of the simple earthly soil, unaltered by the hand of man. The earth, which has been involved in the curse of sin, is to be renewed and glorified into the kingdom of God, not by sinful men, but by the gracious hand of God alone. Moreover, Israel was not to erect the altar for its sacrifices in any place that it might choose, but only in every place in which Jehovah should bring His name to remembrance. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; does not mean "to make the name of the Lord remembered," i.e., to cause men to remember it; but to establish a memorial of His name, i.e., to make a glorious revelation of His divine nature, and thereby to consecrate the place into a holy soil (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>), upon which Jehovah would come to Israel and bless it. Lastly, the command not to go up to the altar by steps (<a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) is followed by the words, "that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon." It was in the feeling of shame that the consciousness of sin first manifested itself, and it was in the shame that the sin was chiefly apparent (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>); hence the nakedness was a disclosure of sin, through which the altar of God would be desecrated, and for this reason it was forbidden to ascend to the altar by steps. These directions with reference to the altar to be built do not refer merely to the altar, which was built for the conclusion of the covenant, nor are they at variance with the later instructions respecting the one altar at the tabernacle, upon which all the sacrifices were to be presented (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.), nor are they merely "provisional" but they lay the foundation for the future laws with reference to the places of worship, though without restricting them to one particular locality on the one hand, or allowing an unlimited number of altars on the other. Hence "several places and altars are referred to here, because, whilst the people were wandering in the desert, there could be no fixed place for the tabernacle" (Riehm). But the erection of the altar is unquestionably limited to every place which Jehovah appointed for the purpose by a revelation. We are not to understand the words, however, as referring merely to those places in which the tabernacle and its altar were erected, and to the site of the future temple (Sinai, Shilloh, and Jerusalem), but to all those places also where altars were built and sacrifices offered on extraordinary occasions, on account of God, - appearing there such, for example, as Ebal (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a> compared with <a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>), the rock in Ophrah (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>), and many other places besides. </body></html>
