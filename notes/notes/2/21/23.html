This law, "the jus talionis," is elsewhere repeated in substance, compare the marginal references. and <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. It has its root in a simple conception of justice, and is found in the laws of many ancient nations. It serves in this place as a maxim for the magistrate in awarding the amount of compensation to be paid for the infliction of personal injury. The sum was to be as nearly as possible the worth in money of the power lost by the injured person. Our Lord quotes <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a> as representing the form of the law, in order to illustrate the distinction between the letter and the spirit <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38</a>. The tendency of the teaching of the Scribes and Pharisees was to confound the obligations of the conscience with the external requirements of the law. The law, in its place, was still to be "holy and just and good," <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, but its direct purpose was to protect the community, not to guide the heart of the believer, who was not to exact eye for eye, tooth for tooth, but to love his enemies, and to forgive all injuries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-25. eye for eye&#8212;The law which authorized retaliation (a principle acted upon by all primitive people) was a civil one. It was given to regulate the procedure of the public magistrate in determining the amount of compensation in every case of injury, but did not encourage feelings of private revenge. The later Jews, however, mistook it for a moral precept, and were corrected by our Lord (Mt 5:38-42).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Any mischief; </span> either to the mother or to the child, whether it be death, or any maim or mischief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall give life for life?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answ</span>.

"Life for life" seems an excessive penalty, where the injury was in a great measure accidental, and when there was certainly no design to take life. Probably the law was not now enacted for the first time, but was an old tribal institution, like the law of the "avenger of blood." There are many things in the Mosaic institutions which Moses tolerated, like "bills of divorce" - on account of "the hardness of their hearts." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eye</span> <span class="cmt_word">for eye, tooth for tooth,</span> etc. Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics, that this was the rule of justice  which Rhadamanthus was supposed to act on in the judgment after death (book 5, see. 3), and that it had the approval of the Pythagoreans. Solon admitted it to a certain extent into the laws of Athens, and at Rome it found its way. into the Twelve Tables. There is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> appearance of exact equality in it, which would captivate rude minds and cause the principle to be widely adopted in a rude state of society. But in practice objections would soon be felt to it. There is no exact measure of the hardness of a blow, or the severity of a wound; and "wound for wound, stripe for stripe," would open a door for very unequal inflictions "Eye for eye" would be flagrantly unjust in the case of a one-eyed man. Moreover, it is against public policy to augment unnecessarily the number of mutilated and maimed citizens, whose power to serve the state is lessened by their mutilation. Consequently in every society retaliation has at an early date given way to pecuniary compensation; and this was the case even among the Hebrews, as Kalisch has shown satisfactorily. If the literal sense was insisted on in our Lord' s day (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38</a>), it was only by the Sadducees, who declined to give the law a spiritual interpretation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"But he who acts presumptuously against his neighbour, to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from Mine altar that he may die." These words are not to be understood as meaning, that only intentional and treacherous killing was to be punished with death; but, without restricting the general rule in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, they are to be interpreted from their antithesis to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, as signifying that even the altar of Jehovah was not to protect a man who had committed intentional murder, and carried out his purpose with treachery. (More on this point at <a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>.) By this regulation, the idea, which was common to the Hebrews and many other nations, that the altar as God's abode afforded protection to any life that was in danger from men, was brought back to the true measure of its validity, and the place of expiation for sins of weakness (cf. <a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>) was prevented from being abused by being made a place of refuge for criminals who were deserving of death. Maltreatment of a father and mother through striking (<a href="/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>), man-stealing (<a href="/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16</a>), and cursing parents (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>), were all to be placed on a par with murder, and punished in the same way. By the "smiting" (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;) of parents we are not to understand smiting to death, for in that case &#1493;&#1502;&#1514; would be added as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, but any kind of maltreatment. The murder of parents is not mentioned at all, as not likely to occur and hardly conceivable. The cursing (&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; as in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) of parents is placed on a par with smiting, because it proceeds from the same disposition; and both were to be punished with death, because the majesty of God was violated in the persons of the parents (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Man-stealing was also no less a crime, being a sin against the dignity of man, and a violation of the image of God. For &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "a man," we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; "a soul," by which both man and woman are intended, and the still more definite limitation, "of his brethren of the children of Israel." The crime remained the same whether he had sold him (the stolen man), or whether he was still found in his hand. (For &#1493; - &#1493; as a sign of an alternative in the linking together of short sentences, see <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>, and Ewald, 361.) This is the rendering adopted by most of the earlier translators, and we get no intelligent sense if we divide the clauses thus: "and sell him so that he is found in his hand." </body></html>
