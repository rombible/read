Hebrew <span class="ital">female slaves</span>. The law for female slaves is different. A female slave does not receive her freedom at the end of six years (<span class="ital">v.</span> 7); still, she cannot be sold to a non-Israelite; and if her master, before actually taking her as his concubine, finds he does not like her she must be redeemed (<span class="ital">v.</span> 8). If her master has bought her for his son she must have the usual rights of a daughter (<span class="ital">v.</span> 9). If her master take another concubine, she is in no respect to be defrauded of her food, dress, and conjugal rights (<span class="ital">v.</span> 10): if these be withheld, her freedom must be given her unconditionally (<span class="ital">v.</span> 11). The reason for the different treatment of female slaves is to be found in the fact that a female slave was as a rule (<span class="ital">v.</span> 8) her master’s concubine; she stood consequently to her master in a relation which could not suitably be terminated at the end of six years. Concubinage was common among the ancient Hebrews (among the patriarchs, <a href="/genesis/16-3.htm" title="And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.">Genesis 16:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-24.htm" title="And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.">Genesis 22:24</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.">Genesis 30:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-9.htm" title="When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.">Genesis 30:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>; in the time of the Judges, <a href="/judges/8-31.htm" title="And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.">Jdg 8:31</a>; <a href="/judges/9-18.htm" title="And you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, three score and ten persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)">Jdg 9:18</a>; <a href="/judges/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.">Jdg 19:1</a> ff.; and among the early kings, <a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm" title="And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?">2 Samuel 3:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm" title="And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.">2 Samuel 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-16.htm" title="And the king went forth, and all his household after him.

In civilised nations the right was seldom exercised; but what restrained men was rather a sentiment of pride than any doubt of such sales being proper. Many barbarous nations, like the Thracians (Herod. 5:6), made a regular practice of selling their daughters. Even at Athens there was a time when sales of children had been common (Plut. <span class="accented">Vit. Solon</span>. &sect; 13). Existing custom, it is clear, sanctioned such sales among the Hebrews, and what the law now did was to step in and mitigate the evil consequences. (Compare the comment on verse 2.) These were greatest in the case of females. Usually they were bought to be made the concubines, or secondary wives of their masters. If this intention were carried out, then they were to be entitled to their status and maintenance as wives during their lifetime, even though their husband took another (legitimate) wife (ver. 10). If the retention was not carried out, either the man was to marry her to one of his sons (ver. 9), or he was to sell his rights over her altogether with his obligations to another Hebrew; or he was to send her back at once <span class="accented">intact</span> to her father' s house, without making any claim on him to refund the purchase-money. These provisos may not have furnished a remedy against all the wrongs of a weak, and, no doubt, an oppressed class; but they were important mitigations of the existing usages, and protected the slave-concubine to a considerable extent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The mishpatim (<a href="/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>) are not the "laws, which were to be in force and serve as rules of action," as Knobel affirms, but the rights, by which the national life was formed into a civil commonwealth and the political order secured.
