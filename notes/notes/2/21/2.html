In any consideration of the rights of persons, those of the slave class naturally presented themselves first of all, since they were the most liable to infraction.

This law was an enormous advance upon anything previously known in the slave legislation of the most civilised country, and stamps the Mosaic code at once as sympathising with the slave, and bent on ameliorating his lot.

If thou buy an Hebrew servant&#8212;Every Israelite was free-born; but slavery was permitted under certain restrictions. An Hebrew might be made a slave through poverty, debt, or crime; but at the end of six years he was entitled to freedom, and his wife, if she had voluntarily shared his state of bondage, also obtained release. Should he, however, have married a female slave, she and the children, after the husband's liberation, remained the master's property; and if, through attachment to his family, the Hebrew chose to forfeit his privilege and abide as he was, a formal process was gone through in a public court, and a brand of servitude stamped on his ear (Ps 40:6) for life, or at least till the Jubilee (De 15:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If thou buy an Hebrew servant; of which practice see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/jeremiah/34-14.htm" title="At the end of seven years let you go every man his brother an Hebrew, which has been sold to you; and when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers listened not to me, neither inclined their ear.">Jeremiah 34:14</a></span>.

Now as this servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by his theft, his robbing God of his glory by the transgression of his precepts; so likewise, in his being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the Son of God, makes his people free from the said bondage, and who are free indeed, and made so freely without money, and without price, of pure free grace, without any merit or desert of theirs; and which freedom is attended with many bountiful and liberal blessings of grace. <p>(d) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

The conditions of society in ancient Israel were such that slavery could not be abolished: but it was regulated, and restrictions were imposed on the power of a master over his slave (see also <span class="ital">vv.</span> 20 f., 26 f.). An Israelite might fall into slavery from different causes: (1) he might be sold by his parents, a case of particularly common occurrence with daughters; (2) he might be sold for theft (<a href="/exodus/22-3.htm" title="If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.">Exodus 22:3</a>) or insolvency (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2 Kings 4:1</a>, <a href="/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>); (3) he might be obliged by poverty to sell himself (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39</a>).

Slavery, it is clear, was an existing institution. The law of Moses did not make it, but found it, and by not forbidding, allowed it. The Divine legislator was content under the circumstances to introduce mitigations and alleviations into the slave condition. Hebrews commonly became slaves through poverty (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 39</a>), but sometimes through crime (<a href="/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the seventh he shall go out.</span> Not in the Sabbatical year, but at the commencement of the seventh year after he became a slave. If the jubilee year happened to occur, he might be released sooner (<a href="/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40</a>); but in any case his servitude must end when the sixth year of it was completed. This was an enormous boon, and had nothing, so far as is known, correspondent to it in the legislation of any other country. Nor was this all. When he went out free, his late master was bound to furnish him with provisions out of his flock, and out of his threshing floor, and out of his winepress (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-14</a>), so that he might have something wherewith to begin the world afresh.

"From heaven" Jehovah came down upon Sinai enveloped in the darkness of a cloud; and thereby He made known to the people that His nature was heavenly, and could not be imitated in any earthly material. "Ye shall not make with Me," place by the side of, or on a par with Me," "gods of silver and gold," - that is to say, idols primarily intended to represent the nature of God, and therefore meant as symbols of Jehovah, but which became false gods from the very fact that they were intended as representations of the purely spiritual God. </body></html>
