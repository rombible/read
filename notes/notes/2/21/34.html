As this guilt, however, had not been incurred through an intentional crime, but had arisen simply from carelessness, he was allowed to redeem his forfeited life by the payment of expiation money (&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;, lit., covering, expiation, cf. <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>), "according to all that was laid upon him," sc., by the judge.</body></html>
