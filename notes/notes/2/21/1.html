The first verse is the general title of the laws contained in this and the two following chapters. Their government being purely a theocracy, that which in other states is to be settled by human prudence, was directed among them by a divine appointment. These laws are called <span class="ital">judgments; </span>because their magistrates were to give judgment according to them. In the doubtful cases that had hitherto occurred, Moses had particularly inquired of God, but now God gave him <span class="ital">statutes in general, </span>by which to determine <span class="ital">particular cases. </span>He begins with the laws concerning servants, commanding mercy and moderation toward them. The Israelites had lately been servants themselves, and now they were become not only their own masters, but masters of servants too; lest they should abuse their servants as they themselves had been abused, provision was made for the mild and gentle usage of servants.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments; and though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they binding on us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of natural justice. The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by robbing God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts. Likewise in being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who are free indeed; and made so freely, without money and without price, of free grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Judgments - i. e. decisions of the law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>Ex 21:1-6.

The judicial laws respecting the civil state of the people of Israel, so called because they are founded on justice and equity, and are according to the judgment of God, whose judgment is according to truth; and because they are such by which the commonwealth of Israel was to be judged or governed, and were to be the rule of their conduct to one another, and a rule of judgment to their judges in the execution of judgment and justice among them: <p>which thou shall set before them; besides the ten commands before delivered. They were spoken by God himself in the hearing of the people; these were delivered to Moses after he went up to the mount again, at the request of the people, to be their mediator, to be by him set before them as the rule of their behaviour, and to enjoin them the observance of them; in order to which he was not only to rehearse them, but to write them out, and set them in a plain and easy light before them: and though they did not hear these with their own ears from God himself, as the ten commands; yet, as they had the utmost reason to believe they came from him, and it was at their own request that he, and not God, might speak unto them what was further to be said, with a promise they would obey it, as if they had immediately heard it from him; it became them to receive these laws as of God, and yield a cheerful obedience to them; nor do we find they ever questioned the authority of them; and as their government was a Theocracy, and God was more immediately their King than he was of any other people, it was but right, and what might be expected, that they should have their civil laws from him, and which was their privilege, and gave them the preference to all other nations, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1.</span> <span class="ital">Now</span>] <span class="bld">And</span>—introducing a new element in the collection, viz. the ‘judgements’ contained in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a> to <a href="/exodus/22-17.htm" title="If her father utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.">Exodus 22:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the judgements</span>] i.e. legal precedents, intended to have the force of law.

No doubt, the decisions which Moses gave, when he ‘sat to judge the people’ (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.">Exodus 18:13</a>; cf. on <a href="/context/exodus/18-15.htm" title="And Moses said to his father in law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:...">Exodus 18:15-16</a>), became thus the foundation of Hebrew legislation (cf. p. 161)2[185].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[184] In its original sense, the word is a term belonging to civil and criminal law; but it is sometimes extended so as to include moral and religious injunctions (as <a href="/context/leviticus/18-4.htm" title="You shall do my judgments, and keep my ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God....">Leviticus 18:4-5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm" title="You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm" title="You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in length, in weight, or in measure.">Leviticus 19:35</a>); it is also sometimes in EVV. rendered more clearly by ‘ordinance’ (e.g. <a href="/exodus/15-25.htm" title="And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,">Exodus 15:25</a>, <a href="/joshua/24-25.htm" title="So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.">Joshua 24:25</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-2.htm" title="Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.">Isaiah 58:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm" title="Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:7</a> RV.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[185] ‘En-Mishpâṭ (<a href="/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>), the ‘Spring of judgement,’ as Ḳadesh (the ‘sacred’ place) was also called, was doubtless once a sacred spring, at which judicial decisions were obtained (cf. <span class="ital">DB.</span> iii. 67a, v. 616b).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">set before them</span>] <a href="/exodus/19-7.htm" title="And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.">Exodus 19:7</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">These are the judgments</span>. The term "judgment" applies most properly to the decisions of courts and the laws founded upon them.

This is passed over here, and it is merely observed, for the purpose of closing the first act in the giving the law, and preparing the way for the second, that the people remained afar off, whereas Moses (and Aaron, cf. <a href="/exodus/19-24.htm">Exodus 19:24</a>) drew near to the darkness where God was, to receive the further commands of the Lord. </body></html>
