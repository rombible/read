But the arbitrary character of this explanation is apparent at once; for &#1497;&#1500;&#1491; only denotes a child, as a fully developed human being, and not the fruit of the womb before it has assumed a human form. In a manner no less arbitrary &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1503; has been rendered by Onkelos and the Rabbins &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;, death, and the clause is made to refer to the death of the mother alone, in opposition to the penal sentence in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, which not only demands life for life, but eye for eye, etc., and therefore presupposes not death alone, but injury done to particular members. The omission of &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, also, apparently renders it impracticable to refer the words to injury done to the woman alone.)<p>a pecuniary compensation was to be paid, such as the husband of the woman laid upon him, and he was to give it &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; by (by an appeal to) arbitrators. A fine is imposed, because even if no injury had been done to the woman and the fruit of her womb, such a blow might have endangered life. (For &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; roF(  to go out of the womb, see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25-26</a>.) The plural &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; is employed for the purpose of speaking indefinitely, because there might possibly be more than one child in the womb. "But if injury occur (to the mother or the child), thou shalt give soul for soul, eye for eye,...wound for wound:" thus perfect retribution was to be made.</body></html>
