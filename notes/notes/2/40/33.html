So <span class="ital">Moses finished the work — </span>As when God had finished this earth, which he designed for man’s habitation, he made man, and put him in possession of it; so when Moses had finished the tabernacle, which was designed for God’s dwelling-place among men, God came and took possession of it. By these visible tokens of his coming among them, he testified both the return of his favour, which they had forfeited by the golden calf, and his gracious acceptance of their care and pains about the tabernacle. Thus God showed himself well pleased with what they had done, and abundantly rewarded them. <span class="ital">A cloud covered the tent — </span>The same cloud which, as <span class="ital">the chariot </span>or <span class="ital">pavilion </span>of the Shechinah, had come up before them out of Egypt, now settled upon the tabernacle, and hovered over it, even in the hottest and clearest day; for it was none of those clouds which the sun scatters. This cloud was intended to be a token of God’s presence, constantly visible day and night to all Israel. It was also a protection of the tabernacle: they had sheltered it with one covering upon another, but, after all, the cloud that covered it was its best guard; and a guide to the camp of Israel in their march through the wilderness. While the cloud continued on the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they removed and followed it, as being purely under a divine conduct. <span class="ital">And the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle — </span>The Shechinah now made an awful entry into the tabernacle, passing through the outer part of it into the most holy place, and there seating itself between the cherubim. It was in <span class="ital">light </span>and <span class="ital">fire, </span>and, for aught we know, no otherwise, that the Shechinah made itself visible. With these the tabernacle was now filled; yet, as before, <span class="ital">the bush, </span>so now <span class="ital">the curtains </span>were <span class="ital">not consumed; </span>for to those that have <span class="ital">received the anointing, </span>the majesty of God is not destroying. Yet now so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful was the fire, that Moses was <span class="ital">not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, </span>at the door of which he attended till the splendour was a little abated, and the <span class="ital">glory of the Lord </span>retired within the veil. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom <span class="ital">God caused to draw near and approach, </span>and, <span class="ital">as the forerunner, he is for us entered, </span>and has invited us to <span class="ital">come boldly </span>even to the mercy-seat. He was <span class="ital">able to enter into the holy place not made with hands; </span>he is himself the true tabernacle, <span class="ital">filled with the glory of God, </span>even with that divine <span class="ital">grace and truth </span>which were figured by this <span class="ital">fire and light. </span>In him the Shechinah took up its <span class="ital">rest for ever, </span>for <span class="ital">in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>40:16-33 When the tabernacle and the furniture of it were prepared, they did not put off rearing it till they came to Canaan; but, in obedience to the will of God, they set it up in the midst of their camp. Those who are unsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want of religion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, even in a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before we come to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceive ourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few entered Canaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the care of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the vail - That is, opposite to the ark, in the middle between the table of showbread on the North and the candlestick on the South. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.
