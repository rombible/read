As when he first went up into Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.">Exodus 24:16</a>), so now, he waited for a Divine summons, a distinct command fixing the time for him to do that which he knew that he had to do. There is an importance and a fitness in “times and seasons,” which the Great Father often reserves it to Himself to determine (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>). Moses felt this, and waited, till after a time the summons came. God fixed for the erection “the first day of the first month” (<a href="/exodus/40-2.htm" title="On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:2</a>)—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the New Year’s Day of the first year of freedom. At the same time He gave directions fixing the order in which all should be done, and determining the position of the various articles of furniture which the Tabernacle and its court were to contain (<a href="/context/exodus/40-4.htm" title="And you shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.">Exodus 40:4-8</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>40:1-15 When a new year begins, we should seek to serve God better than the year before. In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When the hearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in a short time; and when the commandments of God are continually attended to, as the rule of working, all will be done well. The high-priesthood was in the family of Aaron till Christ came, and in Him, the substance of all these shadows, it continues for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 40<p>Ex 40:1-38.

All was now ready. Bezaleel and Aholiab had completed their task. The work for the tabernacle had been given in, and had been approved Moses did not however at once set it up. He waited for a command from God. After a short interval, the command came. He was ordered to select the first day of the ensuing year - the first day of the first year of freedom - for the operation. Directions were given him, which fixed the order in which the various parts were to be set up, and assigned to the various articles of furniture their proper places (vers. 1-8). When he had arranged the whole as directed, he was to anoint the various parts (vers. 9-11). He was then to wash and dress Aaron, and his sons; to invest them with their robes of office (vers. 12-14), and to anoint them to be priests (ver. 15). The orders given were executed, except (as it would seem) those concerning the investiture of the priests and the anointing, which were deferred. (See <a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6-30</a>.) In one day the sanctuary was completely set up (vers. 18-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <span class="accented">The directions to set up the tabernacle</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The lamps of the order," i.e., the lamps set in order upon the candlestick.
