This cloud was a token of God's presence to be seen day and night, by all Israel, that they might never again question, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? It guided the camp of Israel through the wilderness. While the cloud rested on the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they followed it. The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In light and fire the Shechinah made itself visible: God is Light; our God is a consuming Fire. Yet so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful the fire, that Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, till the splendour was abated. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom God caused to draw near; and who has invited us to come boldly, even to the mercy-seat. Being taught by the Holy Spirit to follow the example of Christ, as well as to depend upon him, to attend his ordinances, and obey his precepts, we shall be kept from losing our way, and be led in the midst of the paths of judgment, till we come to heaven, the habitation of his holiness.

It was brought from Gibeon to Jerusalem by Solomon <a href="/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>. After this, it disappears from the narrative of Scripture. When the temple of Solomon was built, "the tabernacle of the tent" had entirely performed its work; it had protected the ark of the covenant during the migrations of the people until they were settled in the land, and the promise was fulfilled, that the Lord would choose out a place for Himself in which His name should be preserved and His service should be maintained <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Deuteronomy 12:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-24.htm">Deuteronomy 14:24</a>.<p>In accordance with its dignity as the most sacred object in the sanctuary, the original ark of the covenant constructed by Moses was preserved and transferred from the tabernacle to the temple. The golden altar, the candlestick and the showbread table were renewed by Solomon. They were subsequently renewed by Zerubbabel, and lastly by the Maccabees (see <a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>.)

In like manner, the church had divine revelation for its guide from the first&#8212;long before the Word of God existed in a written form; but ever since the setting up of that sacred canon, it rests on that as its tabernacle and there only is it to be found. It accompanies us wherever we are or go, just as the cloud led the way of the Israelites. It is always accessible and can be carried in our pockets when we walk abroad; it may be engraved on the inner tablets of our memories and our hearts; and so true, faithful, and complete a guide is it, that there is not a scene of duty or of trial through which we may be called to pass in the world, but it furnishes a clear, a safe, and unerring direction (Col 3:16).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The same pillar which in the day-time was like a cloud, in the night-time had the appearance of fire.

The laver, which stood between the altar and the entrance to the dwelling, was probably placed more to the side; so that when the priests washed their hands and feet, before entering the dwelling or approaching the altar, there was no necessity for them to go round the altar, or to pass close by it, in order to get to the laver. Last of all the court was erected round about the dwelling and the altar, by the setting up of the pillars, which enclosed the space round the dwelling and the altar with their drapery, and the hanging up of the curtain at the entrance to the court. There is no allusion to the anointing of these holy places and things, as commanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>, in the account of their erection; for this did not take place till afterwards, viz., at the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>). It is stated, however, on the other hand, that as the vessels were arranged, Moses laid out the shew-bread upon the table (<a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>), burned sweet incense upon the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/40-27.htm">Exodus 40:27</a>), and offered "the burnt-offering and meat-offering," i.e., the daily morning and evening sacrifice, upon the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). Consequently the sacrificial service was performed upon them before they had been anointed. Although this may appear surprising, there is no ground for rejecting a conclusion, which follows so naturally from the words of the text. The tabernacle and its furniture were not made holy things for the first time by the anointing; this simply sanctified them for the use of the nation, i.e., for the service which the priests were to perform in connection with them on behalf of the congregation (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>). They were made holy things and holy vessels by the fact that they were built, prepared, and set up, according to the instructions given by Jehovah; and still more by the fact, that after the tabernacle had been erected as a dwelling, the "glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>). But the glory of the Lord entered the dwelling before the consecration of the priests, and the accompanying anointing of the tabernacle and its vessels; for, according to <a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>., it was from the tabernacle that Jehovah spake to Moses, when He gave him the laws of sacrifice, which were promulgated before the consecration of the priests, and were carried out in connection with it. But when the glory of the Lord had found a dwelling-place in the tabernacle, Moses was not required to offer continually the sacrifice prescribed for every morning and evening, and by means of this sacrifice to place the congregation in spiritual fellowship with its God, until Aaron and his sons had been consecrated for this service. </body></html>
