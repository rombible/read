The Rabbis, understanding the pron. in ‘their anointing’ to refer to Aaron’s sons alone, inferred that the anointing of Aaron’s actual sons sufficed for the ordinary priests in all future ages, and that in the case of the ordinary priests the ceremony was never afterwards repeated (cf. Di., and Kalisch, <span class="ital">Leviticus</span>, pp. 666–8).

The oil was first poured upon Aaron's head (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), and afterwards sprinkled upon him (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). It was, apparently, only sprinkled upon the priests (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). This was a lower form of anointing; and hence the high priest was sometimes called "<span class="accented">the</span> anointed priest" (<a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5, 16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span> The Rabbinical commentators maintain that these words apply to the ordinary priests only, and on the strength of them establish a difference between the ordinary priests and the high priests. The latter were in every ease to be anointed to their office. A single anointing sainted for the former. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no Scriptural ground for this distinction. The natural sense of the words is, rather, that as long as the anointing continued, the priesthood should continue. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the completion of all the works, the command was given by God to Moses to set up the dwelling of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (see at <a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a>), sc., in the second year of the Exodus (see <a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>), and to put all the vessels, both of the dwelling and court, in the places appointed by God; also to furnish the table of shew-bread with its fitting out (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>), i.e., to arrange the bread upon it in the manner prescribed (<a href="/exodus/40-4.htm">Exodus 40:4</a> cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6-7</a>), and to put water in the laver of the court (<a href="/exodus/40-7.htm">Exodus 40:7</a>). After that he was to anoint the dwelling and everything in it, also the altar of burnt-offering and laver, with the anointing oil, and to sanctify them (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>); and to consecrate Aaron and his sons before the door of the tabernacle, and clothe them, anoint them, and sanctify them as priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12-15</a>). When we read here, however, that the dwelling and the vessels therein would be rendered "holy" through the anointing, but the altar of burnt-offering "most holy," we are not to understand this as attributing a higher degree of holiness to the altar of burnt-offering than to the dwelling and its furniture; but the former is called "most holy" merely in the sense ascribed to it in <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a> namely, that every one who touched it was to become holy; in other words, the distinction has reference to the fact, that, standing as it did in the court, it was more exposed to contact from the people than the vessels in the dwelling, which no layman was allowed to enter. In this relative sense we find the same statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>, with reference to the tabernacle and all the vessels therein, the dwelling as well as the court, that they would become most holy in consequence of the anointing (see the remarks on <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). It is stated provisionally, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>, that this command was fulfilled by Moses. But from the further history we find that the consecration of the priests did not take place contemporaneously with the erection of the tabernacle, but somewhat later, or not till after the promulgation of the laws of sacrifice (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> and <a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>.). </body></html>
