Those who are unsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want of religion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, even in a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before we come to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceive ourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few entered Canaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the care of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the vail - That is, opposite to the ark, in the middle between the table of showbread on the North and the candlestick on the South. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

After these things had been placed, the curtain was hung in the door of the dwelling. </body></html>
