An army might more easily have been resisted than this host of insects. Who then is able to stand before the great God? They covered the face of the earth, and ate up the fruit of it. Herbs grow for the service of man; yet when God pleases, insects shall plunder him, and eat the bread out of his mouth. Let our labour be, not for the habitation and meat thus exposed, but for those which endure to eternal life. Pharaoh employs Moses and Aaron to pray for him. There are those, who, in distress, seek the help of other people's prayers, but have no mind to pray for themselves. They show thereby that they have no true love to God, nor any delight in communion with him. Pharaoh desires only that this death might be taken away, not this sin. He wishes to get rid of the plague of locusts, not the plague of a hard heart, which was more dangerous. An east wind brought the locusts, a west wind carries them off. Whatever point the wind is in, it is fulfilling God's word, and turns by his counsel. The wind bloweth where it listeth, as to us; but not so as it respects God. It was also an argument for their repentance; for by this it appeared that God is ready to forgive, and swift to show mercy. If he does this upon the outward tokens of humiliation, what will he do if we are sincere! Oh that this goodness of God might lead us to repentance! Pharaoh returned to his resolution again, not to let the people go. Those who have often baffled their convictions, are justly given up to the lusts of their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Evil is before you - i. e.

Of such a character was the impassioned scene in the court of Egypt when the king had wrought himself into such a fit of uncontrollable fury as to treat ignominiously the two venerable representatives of the Hebrew people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is no unusual plague in Africa and Arabia, where, when the harvest is ripe, they frequently come in vast numbers, and upon all their corn, and what they do not eat they infect with their touch, and the moisture coming from them, and afterwards dying in great numbers, they poison the air, and cause a pestilence. So that it is no wonder that Pharaoh and his servants were so concerned for this plague, so well known to them, especially considering that this was like to be far worse than all of the same kind which they had either seen or heard of. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses, stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt,....

The word does in fact include winds at least from the SE. The ‘east wind’ commonly denotes the violent and scorching <span class="bld">sirocco</span> (from Arab. <span class="ital">sherḳîyeh</span>, ‘eastern’), often described as ‘drying up’ vegetation, &c. (<a href="/ezekiel/17-10.htm" title="Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.">Ezekiel 17:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm" title="But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.">Ezekiel 19:12</a>, <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a>); hence the Vulg. here has ‘ventus <span class="ital">urens</span>.’ ‘That the wind brings locusts is stated by ancient and modern authorities alike, e.g. Agatharc. p. 42, Strabo, 16. p. 772, Diod.

"They will cover the eye of the earth." This expression, which is peculiar to the Pentateuch, and only occurs again in <a href="/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-11.htm">Numbers 22:11</a>, is based upon the ancient and truly poetic idea, that the earth, with its covering of plants, looks up to man. To substitute the rendering "surface" for the "eye," is to destroy the real meaning of the figure; "face" is better. It was in the swarms that actually hid the ground that the fearful character of the plague consisted, as the swarms of locusts consume everything green. "The residue of the escape" is still further explained as "that which remaineth unto you from the hail," viz., the spelt and wheat, and all the vegetables that were left (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12</a> and <a href="/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>). For "all the trees that sprout" (<a href="/exodus/10-5.htm">Exodus 10:5</a>), we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>, "all the tree-fruits and everything green upon the trees." </body></html>
