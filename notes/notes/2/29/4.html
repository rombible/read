Water is so natural a symbol of purity, and ablution so apt a representative of the purging from sin, that we can feel surprise neither at the widespread use of the symbolism in religions of very different characters, nor at its adoption into the system at this time imposed by Divine Providence upon the Hebrews. As it was to maintain its place even in the Divinely-appointed ceremonial of Christianity, it must have been <span class= "ital">à fortiori </span>suitable for the earlier and less spiritual dispensation.

Ablution was an ancient rite in all acts of worship, as a proper emblem of sanctifying grace, and internal purity, without which external oblations and services are of little signification before God. As this was the first thing that was done for hallowing the priests, (Leviticus 8.,) it is probable their whole bodies were now washed, in token of the necessity of their being washed from all their sins by pardon and regeneration, and thoroughly renewed in heart and life, that they might begin their services aright: but afterward they were appointed to wash only their <span class="ital">hands </span>and their <span class="ital">feet </span>before they entered the tabernacle, (<a href="/exodus/30-19.htm" title="For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:">Exodus 30:19</a>, &c.,) to remind them of those daily imperfections from which even such as are regenerated and created anew have need to be cleansed by a daily application of pardoning mercy, through the blood of atonement. Thus the Lord Jesus, “He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity.

And &#8230; take the garments&#8212;The manner in which these parts of the ceremonial were performed is minutely described, and in discovering their symbolical import, which indeed, is sufficiently plain and obvious, we have inspired authority to guide us. It signified the necessity and importance of moral purity or holiness (Isa 52:11; Joh 13:10; 2Co 7:1; 1Pe 3:21). In like manner, the investiture with the holy garments signified their being clothed with righteousness (Re 19:8) and equipped as men active and well-prepared for the service of God; the anointing the high priest with oil denoted that he was to be filled with the influences of the Spirit, for the edification and delight of the church (Le 10:7; Ps 45:7; Isa 61:1; 1Jo 2:27), and as he was officially a type of Christ (Heb 7:26; Joh 3:34; also Mt 3:16; 11:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Taken out of that laver, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/30-18.htm" title="You shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and you shall put water therein.">Exodus 30:18</a></span>. This signified the universal pollution of all men, and the absolute need they have of washing, especially when they are to draw nigh to God. And this outward washing was only typical of their spiritual washing by the blood and Spirit of Christ in order to their acceptance with God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,....

It was to this probably that Aaron and his sons were to be brought. Its main purpose was to be a lustral vessel, placed ready for the various ablutions which the law required (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 19-21). <span class="cmt_word">Thou .... shalt wash them with water.</span> Ablutions were an important part of the ceremonial of almost all ancient religions. In Egypt, the priests were compelled to wash themselves from head to foot in cold water twice every day, and twice every night (Herod. 2:37). In the religion of Zoroaster frequent washing with water was prescribed for many kinds of impurity (Zendavesta, 8. p. 271, et seq.). The Greeks were particularly addicted to ceremonies of which ablution formed a part; and it is to Rome that we are indebted both for the word and for the idea of "lustration." It is a true instinct which has taught men the analogy between physical and moral purity, and led them to typify the removal of spiritual, by the cleansing from physical, defilement. The religion given at Sinai set a stamp of approval in many points on what may be called "the religion of nature;" and among them on this. Ablutions were required of the priests, not only at consecration, but every time that they entered the tabernacle, or sacrificed on the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>). Washing was a main feature in the cleansing of leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-54.htm">Leviticus 13:54, 58</a>) and of the leper.  (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>). It was also employed for the purification of many minor defilements (<a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm">Leviticus 11:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, etc.). At what date it first came into use in the admission of proselytes is uncertain. Whether the washing of consecration extended to the whole body, or was limited to the hands and feet, is also a point on which critics have disagreed, but one of no great importance. (See <a href="/john/13-9.htm">John 13:9, 10</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But since the clothing prescribed was an official dress, Moses was to put it upon Aaron and his sons, to anoint them and fill their hands, i.e., to invest them with the requisite sacrificial gifts (see at <a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>), and so to sanctify them that they should be priests of Jehovah. For although the holiness of their office was reflected in their dress, it was necessary, on account of the sinfulness of their nature, that they should be sanctified through a special consecration for the administration of their office; and this consecration is prescribed in ch. 29 and carried out in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>.</body></html>
