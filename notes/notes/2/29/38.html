Two lambs were to be offered every day, one in the morning, the other “between the evenings” (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm" title="The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:">Exodus 29:39</a>); partly in expiation of the daily sins of the nation<span class= "bld">, </span>but mainly as a sign that the nation daily renewed its self-dedication to Jehovah, and offered itself afresh to be “a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice” to Him. Meat and drink offerings were to accompany the burnt sacrifice—signs of the gratitude due to God for His perpetual mercies, and acknowledgments of His protecting care and lovingkindness. At the same time incense was to be burnt upon the golden altar before the vail, as a figure of the perpetual prayer that it behoved the nation to send up to the Throne of Grace for a continuance of the Divine favour. (See <a href="/context/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7-8</a>.)<p>(38) <span class= "bld">Two lambs of the first year.</span>—See Note on <a href="/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>.

Scripture says nothing of the disposal of the drink offering. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. Jud. </span>iii. <span class= "ital">9</span>, § 4), it was poured out in libation upon the altar. According to others, a portion only was thus disposed of, while the rest was the priests’.

(See <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a> and Note <span class= "ital">ad loc.</span>) The fact that all communication was to be through the high priest is indicated by the change of person: “Where I will meet <span class= "ital">you, </span>to speak there <span class= "bld">unto </span><span class= "ital">thee.</span>”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38</a></span>. <span class="ital">Two lambs day by day continually — </span>This daily service, a lamb offered upon the altar every morning, and also every evening, typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make, in the virtue of his satisfaction, for the continual sanctification of his church: though he offered himself <span class="ital">once for all, </span>yet that <span class="ital">one offering </span>thus becomes a continual offering.

Its position (after <span class="ital">v.</span> 36 f.) is suitable: for the daily burnt-offering was a central and fundamental element in the worship (cf. Wellh. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> p. 80)—notice the terms in which its suspension by Antiochus Epiphanes is alluded to in <a href="/daniel/8-12.htm" title="And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.">Daniel 8:12</a> f., <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>—and its proper maintenance was one of the chief duties to be performed on the altar of <span class="ital">v.</span> 36 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The law, like <a href="/context/numbers/28-3.htm" title="And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering....">Numbers 28:3-8</a> (cf. also <a href="/leviticus/6-9.htm" title="Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning on the altar all night to the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.">Leviticus 6:9</a>), regulates the post exilic usage. Before the exile, as <a href="/2_kings/16-15.htm" title="And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.">2 Kings 16:15</a> shews, it was the custom to offer a burnt-offering in the morning, but only a <span class="ital">minḥâh</span>, i.e. a cereal, or ‘meal,’ offering in the evening; Ezek. also (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-13.htm" title="And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand....">Ezekiel 48:13-15</a>) prescribes for the restored temple only a morning burnt-offering (with accompanying meal-offering: he prescribes no evening offering at all). Before the exile the <span class="ital">minḥâh</span> thus held an independent position, as the evening offering: the present law duplicates the burnt-offering, and at the same time subordinates the evening <span class="ital">minḥâh</span> to the evening burnt-offering (cf. on <span class="ital">v.</span> 40).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - THE DAILY SACRIFICE. The consecration of the altar, which is made a part of the consecration of the priests, is to be followed immediately by the establishment of the daily sacrifice. Two lambs are to be offered day by day to the Lord, one in the morning and the other in the evening, as "a continual burnt-offering" (ver. 42), in acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Jehovah (Cook), aria that they were bound to offer perpetually "themselves, their souls and bodies, to be a reasonable  holy, and lively sacrifice" to him. The burnt-offerings were to be accompanied by appropriate "meat and drink-offerings" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a certain quantity of flour mingled with olive oil for the one, and a certain quantity of wine for the other - indications of the debt of gratitude which the nation owed to God for his continual benefits <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lambs of the first year</span>.
