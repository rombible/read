This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A tenth deal - i. e. the tenth part of an Ephah; it is sometimes called an Omer (<a href="/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>; see <a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>).
