It signified the necessity and importance of moral purity or holiness (Isa 52:11; Joh 13:10; 2Co 7:1; 1Pe 3:21). In like manner, the investiture with the holy garments signified their being clothed with righteousness (Re 19:8) and equipped as men active and well-prepared for the service of God; the anointing the high priest with oil denoted that he was to be filled with the influences of the Spirit, for the edification and delight of the church (Le 10:7; Ps 45:7; Isa 61:1; 1Jo 2:27), and as he was officially a type of Christ (Heb 7:26; Joh 3:34; also Mt 3:16; 11:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which signified the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, wherewith Christ; as, and the priests ought to be, replenished.

While ablution is a rite common to many religions, the religious use of unction is peculiar to the Mosaic and the Christian. In the Mosaic it was applied to initiate into their office the prophet, the priest, and the king. In Christianity it was originally a rite by which sick persons were miraculously cured (<a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14, 15</a>), from which use it was afterwards extended by ecclesiastical authority to other important ceremonies. The typical meaning under Christianity is clear; the oil represents the Holy Spirit, and the anointing the outpouring of that Spirit on those who are the objects of it. Christ himself obtained his title of Christ (or Messiah), because he was "anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power" (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). Under Mosaism this idea was, at most, latent. Unction was understood to mark <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dignity, because the olive was the first of trees (<a href="/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Continuance, because oil preserves things for a long time from corruption. Unction with the holy oil of the sanctuary no doubt further signified consecration to God's service. It was applied not only to the priests, but to the tabernacle, the ark, the table of shew-bread with its vessels, the seven branched candlestick, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering, and the laver, all of which thereupon became "most holy" (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of Aaron and his Sons through the anointing of their persons and the offering of sacrifices, the directions for which form the subject of vv. 1-35.

It will be more advisable therefore to defer the examination of this ceremony till we come to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>, where the consecration itself is described.
