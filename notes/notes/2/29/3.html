In short, they were taught to know that the service was for them as well as for the people; and every time they engaged in a new performance of their duties, they were reminded of their personal interest in the worship, by being obliged to offer for themselves, before they were qualified to offer as the representatives of the people.<p>this is the thing that thou shalt do&#8212;Steps are taken at the beginning of a society, which would not be repeated when the social machine was in full motion; and Moses, at the opening of the tabernacle, was employed to discharge functions which in later periods would have been regarded as sacrilege and punished with instant death.

But their body-coat is called weavers' work in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>, and was therefore quite a plain cloth, of white byssus or cotton yarn, though it was whole throughout, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; without seam, like the robe of Christ (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23</a>). It was worn close to the body, and, according to Jewish tradition, reached down to the ankles (cf. Josephus, iii. 7, 2). The head-dress of an ordinary priest is called &#1502;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, related to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506; a basin or cup, and therefore seems to have been in the form of an inverted cup, and to have been a plain white cotton cap. The girdle, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, was of the same material and work for Aaron and his sons. This dress was to be for glory and for beauty to the priests, just as Aaron's dress was to him (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>). The glory consisted in the brilliant white colour, the symbol of holiness; whilst the girdle, which an oriental man puts on when preparing for the duties of an office, contained in the four colours of the sanctuary the indication that they were the officers of Jehovah in His earthly kingdom.</body></html>
