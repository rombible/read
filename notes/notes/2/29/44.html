This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The purpose of the formal consecration of the sanctuary and of the priests who served in it was, that the whole nation which Yahweh had set free from its bondage in Egypt might be consecrated in its daily life, and dwell continually in His presence as "a kingdom of priests and an holy nation." <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 29:38-46.

This seems to intimate that something else in the preceding verse is intended, as what should be sanctified, than the tabernacle, as we supply it; or else here is a repetition of the same thing for the confirmation of it, and both that and the altar were, sanctified, or set apart for holy uses, as well as cleansed and expiated by sacrifices: <p>I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office; that is, in a ceremonial way, by separating them from the rest of the children of Israel, by washing, clothing, and anointing them, and by accepting sacrifices offered by them; for this is not to be understood of internal sanctifying grace, which, though Aaron had, and many of his sons that succeeded him, yet not all; nor was it necessary to the performance of the priestly office, though it is in all those who are a royal priesthood, and made priests as well as kings unto God; for they are a holy nation, called with an holy calling, and unto himself, and have it both internally and externally. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify...  the altar</span>. See <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>, where we learn that on the first occasion of Aaron's offering sacrifice upon the brazen altar, "there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat." Thus the altar had its miraculous sanctification, as well as the tabernacle, and was not merely consecrated by human instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify also both Aaron and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that here also something more is intended than had been accomplished by the rites of consecration. The verb is in the future - "I will sanctify" - and must allude to something which has not yet taken place. Probably, sanctification of the spirit is intended - that Divine influence upon the heart which alone makes men really and truly "holy." (Compare <a href="/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8, 15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9, 16</a>.) But in this case the promise must have been conditional. God would sanctify them so far as they would allow him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Daily Burnt-Offering, Meat-Offering, and Drink-Offering. - The directions concerning these are attached to the instructions for the consecration of the priests, because these sacrifices commenced immediately after the completion of the tabernacle, and, like the shew-bread (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>), the daily trimming of the lamps (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>), and the daily incense-offering (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>.), were most intimately connected with the erection of the sanctuary.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-40</a><p>"And this is what thou shalt make (offer) upon the altar; yearling lambs two a day continually," one in the morning, the other between the two evenings (see at <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>); to every one a meat-offering (minchah) of a tenth of fine wheaten flour (soleth, see at <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), mixed with a quarter of a hin of beaten oil (cathith, see at <a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>), and a drink-offering (nesek) of a quarter of a hin of wine. &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1503; (a tenth) is equivalent to &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, the tenth part of an ephah (<a href="/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>), or 198-5 Parisian cubic inches according to Bertheau's measurement. Thenius, however, sets it down at 101-4 inches, whilst the Rabbins reckon it as equivalent to 43 hen's eggs of average size, i.e., somewhat more than 2 1/4 lbs. A hin (a word of Egyptian origin) is 330-9 inches according to Bertheau, 168-9 according to Thenius, or 72 eggs, so that a quarter of a hin would be 18 eggs.</body></html>
