There must be a <span class="ital">peace-offering; </span>it is called the <span class="ital">ram of consecration, </span>because there was more in this, peculiar to the occasion, than in the other two. In the burnt-offering, God had the <span class="ital">glory </span>of their priesthood, in this <span class="ital">they </span>had the <span class="ital">comfort </span>of it. And in token of a mutual covenant between God and them, the blood of this sacrifice was divided between God and them, part of the blood was <span class="ital">sprinkled upon the altar round about, </span>and part upon them, upon their bodies, and upon their garments. Thus the benefit of the expiation made by the sacrifice was applied and assured to them, and their whole selves, from <span class="ital">head </span>to <span class="ital">foot, </span>sanctified to the service of God. The blood was put upon the <span class="ital">extreme </span>parts of the body, to signify that it was all, as it were, <span class="ital">enclosed </span>and <span class="ital">taken in </span>for God, the tip of the ear and the great toe not excepted. And the <span class="ital">blood </span>and <span class="ital">oil </span>signified the blood of Christ, and the graces of the Spirit, which constitute and complete the beauty of holiness, and recommend us to God. The <span class="ital">flesh of the sacrifice, </span>with the meat-offering annexed to it, was likewise divided between God and them, that (to speak with reverence) God and they might <span class="ital">feast together, </span>in token of friendship and fellowship.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity. Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10.

And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle&#8212;This part of the ceremonial consisted of three sacrifices: (1) The sacrifice of a bullock, as a sin offering; and in rendering it, the priest was directed to put his hand upon the head of his sacrifice, expressing by that act a consciousness of personal guilt, and a wish that it might be accepted as a vicarious satisfaction. (2) The sacrifice of a ram as a burnt offering (Ex 29:15-18). The ram was to be wholly burnt, in token of the priest's dedication of himself to God and His service. The sin offering was first to be presented, and then the burnt offering; for until guilt be removed, no acceptable service can be performed. (3) There was to be a peace offering, called "the ram of consecration" (Ex 29:19-22). And there was a marked peculiarity in the manner in which this other ram was to be disposed of. The former was for the glory of God&#8212;this was for the comfort of the priest himself; and as a sign of a mutual covenant being ratified, the blood of the sacrifice was divided&#8212;part sprinkled on the altar round about, and part upon the persons and garments of the priests. Nay, the blood was, by a singular act, directed to be put upon the extremities of the body, thereby signifying that the benefits of the atonement would be applied to the whole nature of man. Moreover, the flesh of this sacrifice was to be divided, as it were, between God and the priest&#8212;part of it to be put into his hand to be waved up and down, in token of its being offered to God, and then it was to be burnt upon the altar; the other part was to be eaten by the priests at the door of the tabernacle&#8212;that feast being a symbol of communion or fellowship with God. These ceremonies, performed in the order described, showed the qualifications necessary for the priests. (See Heb 7:26, 27; 10:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was for a peace-offering.

This was essentially a <span class="ital">peace</span>-offering,—the special characteristic of which was that the flesh of the sacrifice was partaken of by the offerer and his friends (cf. on <a href="/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>; and see here <span class="ital">vv.</span> 32–34),—with modifications due to the particular occasion (such as the application of the blood to the priests and their garments, <span class="ital">vv.</span> 20, 21, the solemn ‘waving’ of the offerings in the priests’ hands, <span class="ital">vv.</span> 22–25, the special term ‘ram of <span class="ital">installation</span>,’ &c.).

Compare ver. 15; and see also vers. I and 3, where two rams had been mentioned. This second ram is called, "the ram of consecration" in ver. 22, and again in <a href="/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22</a>. It was "by far the most peculiar part of the whole ceremony" (S. Clark). It must be viewed as a "peace-offering" (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>), but one of a peculiar character. The application of the blood to the persons of the priests was altogether unique, and most significant. It was the crowning act of consecration, and implied the complete dedication of their life and of all their powers to the service of the Almighty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of Aaron and his Sons through the anointing of their persons and the offering of sacrifices, the directions for which form the subject of vv. 1-35.
