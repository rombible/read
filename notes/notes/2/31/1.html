Moses was sufficiently informed, by what he had heard and seen, both as to the “Tent of Meeting” itself, and as to all its appurtenances and paraphernalia. But Moses was not himself an artist. Among the branches of knowledge comprised in his Egyptian education the skill of the artistic constructor had not been included. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>B. at the end of the Book.) It was therefore necessary that the manual work of carrying out the instructions given him should be entrusted to others. We might have expected that it would have been left to Moses to select the individuals from among the thousands of artificers who had accompanied him out of Egypt. But God saw fit to mark the importance of the work by taking the direct appointment of the persons to be employed upon Himself. He knew what was in man. He knew to whom he had given the highest artistic power, and who at the same time that they possessed it would work in the most religious spirit. He accordingly named two persons, Bezaleel and Aholiab, as those to whom the superintendence of the whole business should be given. Bezaleel was to be leader and chief, Aholiab assistant. Bezaleel’s task was to be general, Aholiab’s, apparently, special (<a href="/exodus/38-23.htm" title="And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.">Exodus 38:23</a>). Both, however, were to receive the special assistance of God’s Holy Spirit for the due execution of their respective tasks (<a href="/context/exodus/31-3.htm" title="And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,">Exodus 31:3-6</a>), and both, as chosen instruments of God, and faithful workers in His service, had their names equally commemorated in His Holy Book, and were thus upheld as examples to future ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/exodus/31-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Exodus 31:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">See, I have called Bezaleel — </span>The grandson of Hur, probably that Hur who had helped to hold up Moses’s hands, chap. 17., and was at this time in commission with Aaron for the government of the people in the absence of Moses. Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, is appointed next to Bezaleel, and partner with him. Hiram, who was the head workman in the building of Solomon’s temple, was also of the tribe of Dan, <a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm" title="The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:1-11 The Israelites, who had been masons and bricklayers in Egypt, were not qualified for curious workmanship; but the Spirit who gave the apostles utterance in divers tongues, miraculously gave Bezaleel and Aholiab the skill that was wanting. The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it. The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind his proper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any one possesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>. This solemn call of Bezaleel and Aholiab is full of instruction. Their work was to be only that of handicraftsmen. Still it was Yahweh Himself who called them by name to their tasks, and the powers which they were now called upon to exercise in their respective crafts, were declared to have been given them by the Holy Spirit. Thus is every effort of skill, every sort of well-ordered labor, when directed to a right end, brought into the very highest sphere of association.<p>There appears to be sufficient reason for identifying Hur, the grandfather of Bezaleel, with the Hur who assisted Aaron in supporting the hands of Moses during the battle with Amalek at Rephidim <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>, and who was associated with Aaron in the charge of the people while Moses was on the mountain <a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>. Josephus says that he was the husband of Miriam. It is thus probable that Bezaleel was related to Moses. He was the chief artificer in metal, stone, and wood; he had also to perform the apothecary's work in the composition of the anointing oil and the incense <a href="/exodus/37-29.htm">Exodus 37:29</a>. He had precedence of all the artificers, but Aholiab appears to have had the entire charge of the textile work <a href="/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 31<p>Ex 31:1-18.

The directions for the construction of the tabernacle and its furniture being now complete, and the composition of the holy oil and the holy incense having been laid down minutely, it only remained to designate the persons to whom the oversight of the work was to be especially entrusted. These were to be two - Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, as head and chief; Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. There can be no doubt that they were selected, primarily, as already possessing superior artistic powers and acquirements; but in appointing them God promised an infusion of special wisdom and knowledge, so that they were at once naturally and supernaturally fitted for their task. It is important to note that artistic ability is thus distinctly recognised as being quite as much a gift of God as any other, and indeed as coming to man through the Spirit of God (ver. 3). Artistic excellence is not a thing to be despised. It is very capable of abuse; but in itself it is a high gift, bestowed by God on a few only, with the special intent that it should be used to his honour and glory - not indeed in his direct service only - but always so as to improve, elevate, refine mankind, and thus help towards the advancement of God's kingdom <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(see at <a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>.). This anointing oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>), and forbade for all time, on pain of death (<a href="/exodus/30-31.htm">Exodus 30:31</a>), not only the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body (<a href="/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>). "Man," i.e., the ordinary man in distinction from the priests. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; according to its measure, i.e., according to the proportions prescribed for its manufacture. &#1494;&#1512; (<a href="/exodus/30-33.htm">Exodus 30:33</a>) a stranger, is not only the non-Israelite, but laymen or non-priests in general.
