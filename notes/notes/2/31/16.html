But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing from labour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>. The distinction between the meaning of the two expressions, "to be cut off from the people", and "to be put to death", is here indicated. He who was cut off from the people had, by his offence, put himself out of the terms of the covenant, and was an outlaw. On such, and on such alone, when the offence was one which affected the well-being of the nation, as it was in this case, death could be inflicted by the public authority.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-17. Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep&#8212;The reason for the fresh inculcation of the fourth commandment at this particular period was, that the great ardor and eagerness, with which all classes betook themselves to the construction of the tabernacle, exposed them to the temptation of encroaching on the sanctity of the appointed day of rest. They might suppose that the erection of the tabernacle was a sacred work, and that it would be a high merit, an acceptable tribute, to prosecute the undertaking without the interruption of a day's repose; and therefore the caution here given, at the commencement of the undertaking, was a seasonable admonition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="bld">shall keep the sabbath</span> by observing or celebrating the sabbath, i. e. by observing or celebrating it, the antecedent being put for the relative, as is frequently done. So here is another most emphatical repetition to oblige us to the greater caution and diligence in this great duty, and to show what stress God lays upon it, who hath therefore placed this in the midst of the commands of the decalogue, as the heart which gives life and rigour to all the rest. Or it may be rendered thus; <span class="ital">shall observe the day of rest to celebrate the sabbath</span>; and so the phrase is like that in the <span class="ital">fourth command</span>, Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. So here, <span class="ital">Observe the sabbath</span>. i.e. watch its coming and approach, consider attentively the nature and use of it, and that not as a matter of idle speculation, but of serious practice; or, so that you may do or celebrate the sabbath, i.e. perform all the duties of it. Or thus, <span class="ital">shall observe the sabbath, to make it a sabbath or day of rest</span>, and that no idle or carnal rest, but <span class="ital">a rest, holy to the Lord</span>, as it is called in the foregoing verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For a perpetual covenant</span>, or, by a <span class="ital">perpetual covenant</span>, or, it is a <span class="ital">perpetual covenant</span>, i. e. condition or part of that agreement made between me and them.

And this word <span class="ital">perpetual</span>, as also the word <span class="ital">for ever</span>, being added to it in the next verse, may intimate that this hath a longer perpetuity than the ceremonies, to which this phrase is sometimes ascribed, the rather because the reason of this perpetuity given in the next verse is such as hath its force not only till Christ, but even till the end of the world, and it is fit and just that men should retain this monument or memorial of the world’s creation even till its dissolution. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath,....

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>, Oholiab was both faber, a master in metal, stone, and wood work, and also an artistic weaver of colours. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-7.htm">Exodus 38:7-11</a>, the words to be executed, which have been minutely described in ch. 24-30, are mentioned singly once more; and, in addition to these, we find in <a href="/exodus/31-10.htm">Exodus 31:10</a> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; mentioned, along with, or rather before, the holy dress of Aaron. This is the case also in <a href="/exodus/35-19.htm">Exodus 35:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, where there is also the additional clause, "to serve (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; ministrare) in the sanctuary." They were composed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1</a>, of blue and red purple, and crimson. The meaning of the word serad, which only occurs in these passages, is quite uncertain. The Rabbins understand by the bigde hasserad the wrappers in which the vessels of the sanctuary were enclosed when the camp was broken up, as these are called begadim of blue and red purple, and crimson, in <a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>. But this rendering is opposed to the words which follow, and which indicate their use in the holy service, i.e., in the performance of worship, and therefore are quite inapplicable to the wrappers referred to. There is even less ground for referring them, as Gesenius and others do, to the inner curtains of the tabernacle, or the inner hangings of the dwelling-place. For, apart from the uncertainty of the rendering given to serad, viz., netted cloth, filet, it is overthrown by the fact that these curtains of the dwelling-place were not of net-work; and still more decisively by the order in which the bigde hasserad occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, viz., not till the dwelling-place and tent, and everything belonging to them, have been mentioned, even down to the hangings of the court and the pegs of the tent, and all that remains to be noticed is the clothing of the priests. From the definition "to serve in the sanctuary," it is obvious that the bigde serad were clothes used in the worship, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as the lxx have rendered it in agreement with the rest of the ancient versions-that they were, in fact, the rich robes which constituted the official dress of the high priest, whilst "the holy garments for Aaron" were the holy clothes which were worn by him in common with the priests. </body></html>
