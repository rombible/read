It was not only that there might be a danger of zealous men breaking the Sabbatical rest in their eagerness to hasten forward the work of construction now required of them. The re-enactment of the Law might serve to check this tendency if it existed; but clearly the present passage is not specially directed to so narrow an object. It is altogether general in its aim and teaching. It re-enacts the law of the Sabbath (1) under a new sanction; and (2) with new light in its intention and value. Hitherto the Sabbath had been, in the main, a positive enactment intended to test obedience (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.">Exodus 16:4</a>); now it was elevated into a sacramental sign between God and His people (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13</a>). Having become such a sign, it required to be guarded by a new sanction, and this was done by assigning the death-penalty to any infraction of the law of Sabbath observance (<a href="/context/exodus/31-14.htm" title="You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Exodus 31:14-15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:12-17 Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for the service of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing from labour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The penal law of the Sabbath. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2-3</a>. In the fourth commandment the injunction to observe the seventh day is addressed to the conscience of the people (see <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a> note): in this place, the object is to declare an infraction of the commandment to be a capital offence. The two passages stand in a relation to each other similar to that between <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19.htm">Leviticus 19</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a>. It seems likely that the penal edict was especially introduced as a caution in reference to the construction of the tabernacle, lest the people, in their zeal to carry on the work, should be tempted to break the divine law for the observance of the day.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-17. Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep&#8212;The reason for the fresh inculcation of the fourth commandment at this particular period was, that the great ardor and eagerness, with which all classes betook themselves to the construction of the tabernacle, exposed them to the temptation of encroaching on the sanctity of the appointed day of rest. They might suppose that the erection of the tabernacle was a sacred work, and that it would be a high merit, an acceptable tribute, to prosecute the undertaking without the interruption of a day's repose; and therefore the caution here given, at the commencement of the undertaking, was a seasonable admonition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

Various reasons have been given for this recurrence to the sanctity of the sabbath. Kurtz connects it with the giving of the two tables, in which "the law of the sabbath held a particularly prominent  place." Kalisch and others view it rather as the sequel to the directions concerning the tabernacle, and as designed to teach "that the holy service in the tabernacle could not supersede the observance of the sabbath, but derived front that observance its true value." A third set of critics regard the recurrence to the subject as purely practical - being intended to meet an immediate danger - that of the people, in their zeal to erect the tabernacle, setting sabbath observance at nought. (So Jarchi, Aben-Ezra, Clark, Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, and others.) It is to be observed, however, that the present passage is not a mere repetition. It adds to former notices (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) two new points: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the sabbath was to be a sign between God and Israel, a "distinguishing badge," a "sacramental bond" (Cook); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That its desecration was to be punished with death (ver. 15). These were supplementary points of so much importance as to furnish ample reason against their announcement being delayed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There were associated with Bezaleel as assistants, Oholiab, the son of Achisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and other men endowed with understanding, whom God had filled with wisdom for the execution of His work. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>, Oholiab was both faber, a master in metal, stone, and wood work, and also an artistic weaver of colours. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-7.htm">Exodus 38:7-11</a>, the words to be executed, which have been minutely described in ch. 24-30, are mentioned singly once more; and, in addition to these, we find in <a href="/exodus/31-10.htm">Exodus 31:10</a> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; mentioned, along with, or rather before, the holy dress of Aaron. This is the case also in <a href="/exodus/35-19.htm">Exodus 35:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, where there is also the additional clause, "to serve (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; ministrare) in the sanctuary." They were composed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1</a>, of blue and red purple, and crimson. The meaning of the word serad, which only occurs in these passages, is quite uncertain. The Rabbins understand by the bigde hasserad the wrappers in which the vessels of the sanctuary were enclosed when the camp was broken up, as these are called begadim of blue and red purple, and crimson, in <a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>. But this rendering is opposed to the words which follow, and which indicate their use in the holy service, i.e., in the performance of worship, and therefore are quite inapplicable to the wrappers referred to. There is even less ground for referring them, as Gesenius and others do, to the inner curtains of the tabernacle, or the inner hangings of the dwelling-place. For, apart from the uncertainty of the rendering given to serad, viz., netted cloth, filet, it is overthrown by the fact that these curtains of the dwelling-place were not of net-work; and still more decisively by the order in which the bigde hasserad occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, viz., not till the dwelling-place and tent, and everything belonging to them, have been mentioned, even down to the hangings of the court and the pegs of the tent, and all that remains to be noticed is the clothing of the priests. From the definition "to serve in the sanctuary," it is obvious that the bigde serad were clothes used in the worship, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as the lxx have rendered it in agreement with the rest of the ancient versions-that they were, in fact, the rich robes which constituted the official dress of the high priest, whilst "the holy garments for Aaron" were the holy clothes which were worn by him in common with the priests. </body></html>
