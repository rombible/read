Thus a new “sign” was needed. The observance of one day in seven as a day of holy rest became henceforth the distinguishing sign, and proved effectual. It was not likely to be adopted, and in point of fact was not adopted, by any of the heathen. We find it in the latest time of the Jewish nation still regarded as the special mark and badge of a Jew (Juv. <span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 159, 14:96; Mart. <span class= "ital">Epig. 4:4</span>, 50:7, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep — </span>This had been mentioned thrice before, <a href="/exodus/16-23.htm" title="And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.">Exodus 16:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm" title="Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>; but seems here to be repeated lest they should think the sacred work enjoined in this chapter would warrant their breaking in upon the holy rest of that day.

So that this was a mutual stipulation or ratification of the covenant of grace on both sides.” Certainly the institution of the sabbath was a great instance of God’s favour, and a sign that he had separated them from all other people; and their religious observance of it was a great instance of their duty to him. God, by sanctifying this day among them, let them know that he sanctified them, and set them apart for his service, otherwise he would not have revealed to them his holy sabbaths, to be the support of religion among them. The Jews, by observing one day in seven, after six days’ labour, testified that they worshipped the God that made the world in six days, and rested the seventh; and so distinguished themselves from other nations, who, having first lost the sabbath, the memorial of the creation, by degrees lost the knowledge of the Creator, and gave the creature the honour due to him alone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:12-17 Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for the service of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing from labour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The penal law of the Sabbath. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2-3</a>. In the fourth commandment the injunction to observe the seventh day is addressed to the conscience of the people (see <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a> note): in this place, the object is to declare an infraction of the commandment to be a capital offence.

They might suppose that the erection of the tabernacle was a sacred work, and that it would be a high merit, an acceptable tribute, to prosecute the undertaking without the interruption of a day's repose; and therefore the caution here given, at the commencement of the undertaking, was a seasonable admonition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My sabbaths ye shall keep</span>: this precept is here repeated, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>, Oholiab was both faber, a master in metal, stone, and wood work, and also an artistic weaver of colours. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-7.htm">Exodus 38:7-11</a>, the words to be executed, which have been minutely described in ch. 24-30, are mentioned singly once more; and, in addition to these, we find in <a href="/exodus/31-10.htm">Exodus 31:10</a> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; mentioned, along with, or rather before, the holy dress of Aaron. This is the case also in <a href="/exodus/35-19.htm">Exodus 35:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, where there is also the additional clause, "to serve (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; ministrare) in the sanctuary." They were composed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1</a>, of blue and red purple, and crimson. The meaning of the word serad, which only occurs in these passages, is quite uncertain. The Rabbins understand by the bigde hasserad the wrappers in which the vessels of the sanctuary were enclosed when the camp was broken up, as these are called begadim of blue and red purple, and crimson, in <a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>. But this rendering is opposed to the words which follow, and which indicate their use in the holy service, i.e., in the performance of worship, and therefore are quite inapplicable to the wrappers referred to. There is even less ground for referring them, as Gesenius and others do, to the inner curtains of the tabernacle, or the inner hangings of the dwelling-place. For, apart from the uncertainty of the rendering given to serad, viz., netted cloth, filet, it is overthrown by the fact that these curtains of the dwelling-place were not of net-work; and still more decisively by the order in which the bigde hasserad occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, viz., not till the dwelling-place and tent, and everything belonging to them, have been mentioned, even down to the hangings of the court and the pegs of the tent, and all that remains to be noticed is the clothing of the priests. From the definition "to serve in the sanctuary," it is obvious that the bigde serad were clothes used in the worship, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as the lxx have rendered it in agreement with the rest of the ancient versions-that they were, in fact, the rich robes which constituted the official dress of the high priest, whilst "the holy garments for Aaron" were the holy clothes which were worn by him in common with the priests. </body></html>
