It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The blast of God's nostrils corresponds to the natural agency, the east wind <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, which drove the waters back: on the north the waters rose high, overhanging the sands, but kept back by the strongwind: on the south they laid in massive rollers, kept down by the same agency in the deep bed of the Red Sea.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Ex 15:1-27. Song of Moses.<p>1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel&#8212;The scene of this thanksgiving song is supposed to have been at the landing place on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, at Ayoun Musa, "the fountains of Moses." They are situated somewhat farther northward along the shore than the opposite point from which the Israelites set out. But the line of the people would be extended during the passage, and one extremity of it would reach as far north as these fountains, which would supply them with water on landing. The time when it was sung is supposed to have been the morning after the passage. This song is, by some hundred years, the oldest poem in the world. There is a sublimity and beauty in the language that is unexampled. But its unrivalled superiority arises not solely from the splendor of the diction. Its poetical excellencies have often drawn forth the admiration of the best judges, while the character of the event commemorated, and its being prompted by divine inspiration, contribute to give it an interest and sublimity peculiar to itself.<p>I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously&#8212;Considering the state of servitude in which they had been born and bred, and the rude features of character which their subsequent history often displays, it cannot be supposed that the children of Israel generally were qualified to commit to memory or to appreciate the beauties of this inimitable song. But they might perfectly understand its pervading strain of sentiment; and, with the view of suitably improving the occasion, it was thought necessary that all, old and young, should join their united voices in the rehearsal of its words. As every individual had cause, so every individual gave utterance to his feelings of gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of thy nostrils; </span> or, <span class="ital">of thine anger</span>, to wit. that vehement east wind, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm" title="You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.">Exodus 15:10</a> 14:21</span>, which was raised by thine anger in order to the ruin of thine enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The floods, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the streams</span>, or <span class="ital">the flowing waters</span>, whose nature it is to be constantly in motion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Were congealed, </span> i.e. hardened, stood still, as if they had been frozen, and so they were a wall on both hands, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/14-22.htm" title="And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.">Exodus 14:22</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the heart of the sea, </span> i.e. the midst; as that word is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/18-16.htm" title="He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.">Psalm 18:16</a> 46:2 <a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm" title="Son of man, say to the prince of Tyrus, Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the middle of the seas; yet you are a man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God:">Ezekiel 28:2</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,....

Poetically, Moses describes the east wind which God set in motion as "the blast" or "breath of his nostrils." By means of it, he says, the waters were "gathered together," or "piled up;" then, growing bolder in his imagery, he represents the floods as "standing in a heap" on either side, and the depths as "congealed. No doubt, if these terms are meant to be taken literally, the miracle must have been one in which "the sea" (as Kalisch says) "giving up its nature, formed with its waves a firm wall, and instead of streaming like a fluid, congealed into a hard substance."
