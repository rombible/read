It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them.

Song of Moses.<p>1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel&#8212;The scene of this thanksgiving song is supposed to have been at the landing place on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, at Ayoun Musa, "the fountains of Moses." They are situated somewhat farther northward along the shore than the opposite point from which the Israelites set out. But the line of the people would be extended during the passage, and one extremity of it would reach as far north as these fountains, which would supply them with water on landing. The time when it was sung is supposed to have been the morning after the passage. This song is, by some hundred years, the oldest poem in the world. There is a sublimity and beauty in the language that is unexampled. But its unrivalled superiority arises not solely from the splendor of the diction. Its poetical excellencies have often drawn forth the admiration of the best judges, while the character of the event commemorated, and its being prompted by divine inspiration, contribute to give it an interest and sublimity peculiar to itself.<p>I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously&#8212;Considering the state of servitude in which they had been born and bred, and the rude features of character which their subsequent history often displays, it cannot be supposed that the children of Israel generally were qualified to commit to memory or to appreciate the beauties of this inimitable song. But they might perfectly understand its pervading strain of sentiment; and, with the view of suitably improving the occasion, it was thought necessary that all, old and young, should join their united voices in the rehearsal of its words. As every individual had cause, so every individual gave utterance to his feelings of gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the mountain of thine inheritance; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Into the land of Canaan, which is often ascribed to the Lord, as well as his bringing them out of the land of Egypt, see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, <p>and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance; in the country which he chose for the inheritance of his people and himself; one part of which was very mountainous, called the hill country of Judea, and especially Jerusalem, round about which mountains were; and particular respect may be had to Mount Moriah and Zion, on which the temple afterwards stood, and which was called the mountain of the Lord's house, and seems to be pointed at in the following account: here Israel is compared to a vine as elsewhere, which the Lord took out of Egypt and planted in the land of Canaan, where it took root and was settled, see <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>. <p>in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; that is, which he had appointed for his habitation; for as yet neither the tabernacle nor temple were built, in which he afterwards dwelt: in this sense the word "made" is used in <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>. <p>in the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established; that is, which he intended to establish, and would, and did establish; meaning, more especially, the temple, and the holy of holies in it, which he directed Solomon to build, and was a settled dwelling place for him, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>, now all this may be considered as typical of the church of Christ, and of his bringing and planting his people there, which is a "mountain", and often signified by Mount Zion; is visible and immovable, the true members of it being interested in the love of God, on the sure foundation of electing grace, secured in the everlasting covenant, and built on the rock Christ Jesus; and is the Lord's "inheritance", chosen by him to be so, given to Christ, and possessed by him as such, and as dear to him, and more so, than a man's inheritance is to him: this is a "place" he has appointed, prepared, and made for himself to dwell in, and is the habitation of Father, Son, and Spirit; and is a "sanctuary" or holy place, consisting of holy persons established in Christ, as particular believers are, and the church in general is; and though now sometimes in an unsettled state as to outward things, yet ere long will be established on the top of the mountains: and hither the Lord brings his purchased people, as sheep into his fold, as children to his house, fitted up for them, as guests to partake of his entertainments; and this is an act of his powerful grace upon them, and of his distinguished goodness to them: and here he also plants them, for the church is a plantation, a garden, an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; and such as are planted here are transplanted out of the world, and are first planted in Christ, and receive the ingrafted word; and though ministers may be instruments in planting, the Lord is the efficient; and those that are planted by him are choice pleasant plants, fruitful ones, and shall never be plucked up: but as this follows the passage of the Lord's people over Jordan into Canaan land, it may rather be considered as an emblem of the heavenly state, and of the Lord's bringing and planting his people there; which, like a mountain, is an immovable and unalterable state, an inheritance incorruptible and eternal, the dwellingplace of Jehovah, a sanctuary or holy place, which his hand prepared from the foundation of the world; and which he has established as everlasting habitations for his people, where he brings their souls at death, and both souls and bodies in the resurrection morn to dwell with him for ever; and which is a paradise, an Eden of pleasure, where he plants them as trees of righteousness, next to Christ the tree of life, and where they are always green, fruitful, flourishing, and shall never be hurt by any scorching heat or blasting wind, or be trodden under foot or plucked up. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> inheritance, <i>in</i> the place, O LORD, <i>which</i> thou hast made for thee to dwell in, <i>in</i> the Sanctuary, O Lord, <i>which</i> thy hands have established.</span><p>(i) Which was mount Zion, where later the temple was built.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.<span class="ital">Thou</span> <span class="bld">didst</span> <span class="ital">bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The place which thou</span> <span class="bld">hadst made</span> <span class="ital">for thee to dwell in, O</span> <span class="bld">Yahweh</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The final goal of Israel’s triumphant progress through the nations (<span class="ital">vv.</span> 14–16): viz. its settlement in Canaan, with Jehovah’s sanctuary established in its midst.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">plant them</span>] fix them in firmly: the figure, as <a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more;

God had glorified Himself in holiness through the redemption of His people and the destruction of His foes; so that Asaph could sing, "Thy way, O God, is in holiness" (<a href="/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>). &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, holiness, is the sublime and incomparable majesty of God, exalted above all the imperfections and blemishes of the finite creature (vid., <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). "Fearful for praises, doing wonders." The bold expression &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; conveys more than summe venerandus, s. colendus laudibus, and signifies terrible to praise, terribilis laudibus. As His rule among men is fearful (<a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>), because He performs fearful miracles, so it is only with fear and trembling that man can sing songs of praise worthy of His wondrous works. Omnium enim laudantium vires, linguas et mentes superant ideoque magno cum timore et tremore eum laudant omnes angeli et sancti (C. a Lap.). "Thou stretchest out Thy hand, the earth swallows them." With these words the singer passes in survey all the mighty acts of the Lord, which were wrapt up in this miraculous overthrow of the Egyptians. The words no longer refer to the destruction of Pharaoh and his host. What Egypt had experienced would come upon all the enemies of the Lord and His people. Neither the idea of the earth swallowing them, nor the use of the imperfect, is applicable to the destruction of the Egyptians (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-5.htm">Exodus 15:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-19.htm">Exodus 15:19</a>, where the perfect is applied to it as already accomplished).</body></html>
