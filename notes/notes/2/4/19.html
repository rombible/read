But whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he will forbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. He must demand a discharge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thou hast no right to detain, but my son. It is my son that serves me, and therefore must be spared, must be pleaded for. In case of refusal I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.

God knew very well that one great cause of Moses’s unwillingness to this undertaking was his carnal fear, though he was ashamed to profess it, and therefore gives him this cordial. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian,.... After he had obtained leave of his father-in-law to quit Midian, but before he left it: <p>go, return into Egypt: that is, directly, immediately; before he had only given him a commission at large to go thither, but had not fixed the time when he should go; but now he orders him to set forward at once: <p>for all the men are dead which sought thy life; to take it away, the king of Egypt, and his ministers, and the friends of the Egyptian Moses had slain; and this is said to encourage him to go; and though Moses had never expressed his fear on this account, or made it an objection, yet it might lie secretly in his heart, and be one reason of his backwardness to go into Egypt, and which was now removed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. That Moses should now be commanded by God to do what he has already both determined to do, and obtained Jethro’s permission to do, is remarkable; and, as Dillm. remarks, can only be explained by the fact that the verse is by a different narrator from <span class="ital">v.</span> 18 (viz.

It would seem that Moses was still reluctant, and was delaying his departure, even after he had obtained Jethro's leave to go. Perhaps he was making it an excuse to himself for not setting out that if he returned he might still suffer death on account of the offence which had driven him into exile. To remove this last impediment, God assured him that "all the men were dead who had sought his life." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Send, I pray Thee," he says, "by whom Thou wilt send;" i.e., carry out Thy mission by whomsoever Thou wilt. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;: to carry out a mission through any one, originally with accus. rei (<a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14</a>), then without the object, as here, "to send a person" (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>). Before &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; the word &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is omitted, which stands with &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; in the construct state (vid., Ges. 123, 3). The anger of God was now excited by this groundless opposition. But as this unwillingness also arose from weakness of the flesh, the mercy of God came to the help of his weakness, and He referred Moses to his brother Aaron, who could speak well, and would address the people for him (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-17</a>). Aaron is called &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, the Levite, from his lineage, possibly with reference to the primary signification of &#1500;&#1493;&#1492; "to connect one's self" (Baumgarten), but not with any allusion to the future calling of the tribe of Levi (Rashi and Calvin). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; speak will he.
