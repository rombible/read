But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Leprous - The instantaneous production and cure of the most malignant and subtle disease known to the Israelites was a sign of their danger if they resisted the command, and of their deliverance if they obeyed it.

Hereby God would suggest to them how soon he could weaken and destroy the hard and strong hand by which the Egyptians tyrannised over them. It might also be done to keep Moses humble and depending upon God, and to teach him and Israel to ascribe all the future miracles not to the hand of Moses, which was weak and liable to many distempers, but wholly to the Divine power and goodness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said furthermore unto him,....

It is highly probable that this gave rise to the story told by several Heathen writers, as Manetho (m), Lysimachus (n), Trogus (o), and Tacitus (p), that Moses and the Israelites were drove out of Egypt by the advice of an oracle, because they had the leprosy, itch, and other impure diseases upon them. <p>(m) Apud Joseph. contr.

The first sign is followed by a second, equally simple and easy of performance, and perhaps, in the eyes of the Israelites, even more marvellous. Leprosy in a developed form was regarded as absolutely incurable. (Celsus, 'De Re Medica,' 5:7-8.) Its instantaneous production and removal were contrary to all experience, and in themselves thoroughly astonishing. Further, while the first miracle was simply a sign of supernatural power - a credential, the second was a warning and a lesson. What might not he do to smite or to save on whom God had bestowed such power over the human organism? Each man would naturally fear to resist or disobey one so dangerously gifted. <span class="cmt_word">Leprous as snow</span>. The Greek name for the worst form of leprosy, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, was based on this fact of whiteness. The loathsome disease is thus described by Kalisch: - "It begins with mealy crusts and scurfy scabs, originally not larger than a pin's point, a little depressed in the skin (<a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3, 30</a>), and covered with white hairs (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 3, 20). These spots rapidly spread (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8), and produce wild [proud?] flesh (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 10, 14). The leprous symptoms appear most frequently on the hairy parts of the body, and also on members which have been ulcerously affected. When the leprosy has gained ground, <span class="accented">the whole skin appears glossy white</span> at the forehead, nose, etc., tuberated, thickened, dry like leather, but smooth; sometimes it bursts, and ulcers become visible. The nails of the hands and feet fall; the eyelids bend backwards; the hair covers itself with a fetid rind, or goes off entirely (<a href="/leviticus/13-42.htm">Leviticus 13:42</a>). All external senses are weakened: the eyes lose their brightness, become very sensitive, and are continually blearing; from the nostrils runs a fluid phlegm." ('Comment. on Exodus,' p. 50.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Not only would God compel Pharaoh to let Israel go; He would not let His people go out empty, but, according to the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, with great substance. "I will give this people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians;" that is to say, the Egyptians should be so favourably disposed towards them, that when they solicited of their neighbours clothes and ornaments of gold and silver, their request should be granted. "So shall ye spoil the Egyptians." What is here foretold as a promise, the Israelites are directed to do in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2-3</a>; and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>, it was really carried out. Immediately before their departure from Egypt, the Israelites asked (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;) the Egyptians for gold and silver ornaments (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; not vessels, either for sacrifice, the house, or the table, but jewels; cf. <a href="/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>) and clothes; and God gave them favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them to them. For &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, "Let every woman ask of her (female) neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, from which it is evident that the Israelites did not live apart, but along with the Egyptians), we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a>, "Let every man ask of his neighbour, and every woman of her (female) neighbour." - &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, "and put them upon your sons and daughters." &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, to put on, applied to clothes and ornaments in <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a> and <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. This command and its execution have frequently given occasion to the opponents of the Scriptures to throw contempt upon the word of God, the asking being regarded as borrowing, and the spoiling of the Egyptians as purloining. At the same time, the attempts made to vindicate this purloining from the wickedness of stealing have been in many respects unsatisfactory.<p>(Note: For the different views as to the supposed borrowing of the gold and silver vessels, see Hengstenberg, Dissertations on the Pentateuch, vol. ii. pp. 419ff., and Kurtz, History of the Old Covenant, vol. ii.319ff.)<p>But the only meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; is to ask or beg,<p>(Note: Even in <a href="/2_kings/5-6.htm">2 Kings 5:6</a>; see my commentary on the passage.)<p>and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, which is only met with in <a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>, does not mean to lend, but to suffer to ask, to hear and grant a request. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>), lit., they allowed them to ask; i.e., "the Egyptians did not turn away the petitioners, as not wanting to listen to them, but received their petition with good-will, and granted their request. No proof can be brought that &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; means to lend, as is commonly supposed; the word occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>, and there it means to grant or give" (Knobel on <a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>). Moreover the circumstances under which the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; took place, were quite at variance with the idea of borrowing and lending. For even if Moses had not spoken without reserve of the entire departure of the Israelites, the plagues which followed one after another, and with which the God of the Hebrews gave emphasis to His demand as addressed through Moses to Pharaoh, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me," must have made it evident to every Egyptian, that all this had reference to something greater than a three days' march to celebrate a festival. And under these circumstances no Egyptian could have cherished the thought, that the Israelites were only borrowing the jewels they asked of them, and would return them after the festival. What they gave under such circumstances, they could only give or present without the slightest prospect of restoration. Still less could the Israelites have had merely the thought of borrowing in their mind, seeing that God had said to Moses, "I will give the Israelites favour in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it will come to pass, that when ye go out, ye shall not go out empty" (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21</a>). If, therefore, it is "natural to suppose that these jewels were festal vessels with which the Egyptians furnished the poor Israelites for the intended feast," and even if "the Israelites had their thoughts directed with all seriousness to the feast which they were about to celebrate to Jehovah in the desert" (Baumgarten); their request to the Egyptians cannot have referred to any borrowing, nor have presupposed any intention to restore what they received on their return. From the very first the Israelites asked without intending to restore, and the Egyptians granted their request without any hope of receiving back, because God had made their hearts favourably disposed to the Israelites. The expressions &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>, are not at variance with this, but rather require it. For &#1504;&#1510;&#1500; does not mean to purloin, to steal, to take away secretly by cunning and fraud, but to plunder (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>), as both the lxx (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) and Vulgate (spoliare) have rendered it. Rosenmller, therefore, is correct in his explanation: "Et spoliabitis Aegyptios, ita ut ab Aegyptiis, qui vos tam dura servitute oppresserunt, spolia auferetis." So also is Hengstenberg, who says, "The author represents the Israelites as going forth, laden as it were with the spoils of their formidable enemy, trophies of the victory which God's power had bestowed on their weakness. While he represents the gifts of the Egyptians as spoils which God had distributed to His host (as Israel is called in <a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>), he leads us to observe that the bestowment of these gifts, which outwardly appeared to be the effect of the good-will of the Egyptians, if viewed more deeply, proceeded from another Giver; that the outwardly free act of the Egyptians was effected by an inward divine constraint which they could not withstand" (Dissertations, vol. ii. p. 431). - Egypt had spoiled Israel by the tributary labour so unjustly enforced, and now Israel carried off the spoil of Egypt-a prelude to the victory which the people of God will one day obtain in their conflict with the power of the world (cf. <a href="/zechariah/14-14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>). </body></html>
