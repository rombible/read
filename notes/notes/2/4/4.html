God gives him power to work miracles. But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A serpent - This miracle had a meaning which Moses could not mistake. The serpent was probably the basilisk or Uraeus, the Cobra. This was the symbol of royal and divine power on the diadem of every Pharaoh.

Which to do might seem most dangerous, since it might turn upon him and bite him; this was ordered, partly that Moses might be assured it was really a serpent, and not in appearance only; and partly to try his courage, and it suggested to him, that he need not be afraid of it, it would not hurt him: the above learned doctor observes (l), that he is commanded to take it by the tail; for to meddle with the serpent's head belonged not to Moses, but to Christ that spake to him out of the bush: <p>and he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand; as it was before. Some think this refers to the threefold state of the Israelites, first to their flourishing estate under Joseph, when they were as a rod or staff, then to their dejected state, by this rod cast to the ground, and become a serpent, and lastly to their restoration and liberty, by its becoming a rod again: others refer it to Christ, who is the power of God, and the rod of his strength, and who in his state of humiliation was like this rod, cast to the ground and became a serpent, of which the brazen serpent was a type, and who by his resurrection from the dead regained his former power; but perhaps they may be most right who think it refers to the service and ministry of Moses, which seemed terrible to him at first, like a hurtful serpent, from which he fled; but after he was confirmed by the word of God, he readily undertook it. <p>(l) De Vita Mosis, l. 1. 614. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail.

A snake-charmer will usually take up his serpents by the neck, so that they may not be able to bite him. Moses was bidden to show his trust in God by taking up his serpent by the tail.

A veritable rod once more, not a mere stiffened snake like the "rods" of the magicians (<a href="/exodus/7-12.htm">Exodus 7:12</a>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the command, "Go and gather the elders of Israel together," God then gave Moses further instructions with reference to the execution of his mission. On his arrival in Egypt he was first of all to inform the elders, as the representatives of the nation (i.e., the heads of the families, households, and tribes), of the appearance of God to him, and the revelation of His design, to deliver His people out of Egypt and bring them to the land of the Canaanites. He was then to go with them to Pharaoh, and make known to him their resolution, in consequence of this appearance of God, to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God. The words, "I have surely visited," point to the fulfilment of the last words of the dying Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>) does not mean "He is named upon us" (lxx, Onk., Jon.), nor "He has called us" (Vulg., Luth.). The latter is grammatically wrong, for the verb is Niphal, or passive; and though the former has some support in the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>, inasmuch as &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is the verb used there, it is only in appearance, for if the meaning really were "His name is named upon (over) us," the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;) would not be omitted (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The real meaning is, "He has met with us," from &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, obruam fieri, ordinarily construed with &#1488;&#1500;, but here with &#1506;&#1500;, because God comes down from above to meet with man. The plural us is used, although it was only to Moses that God appeared, because His appearing had reference to the whole nation, which was represented before Pharaoh by Moses and the elders. In the words &#1504;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, "we will go, then," equivalent to "let us go," the request for Pharaoh's permission to go out is couched in such a form as to answer to the relation of Israel to Pharaoh. He had no right to detain them, but he had a right to consent to their departure, as his predecessor had formerly done to their settlement. Still less had he any good reason for refusing their request to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God, since their return at the close of the festival was then taken for granted. But the purpose of God was, that Israel should not return. Was it the case, then, that the delegates were "to deceive the king," as Knobel affirms! By no means. God knew the hard heart of Pharaoh, and therefore directed that no more should be asked at first than he must either grant, or display the hardness of his heart. Had he consented, God would then have made known to him His whole design, and demanded that His people should be allowed to depart altogether. But when Pharaoh scornfully refused the first and smaller request (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5</a>), Moses was instructed to demand the entire departure of Israel from the land (<a href="/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and to show the omnipotence of the God of the Hebrews before and upon Pharaoh by miracles and heavy judgments (<a href="/hebrews/7-8.htm">Hebrews 7:8</a>.). Accordingly, Moses persisted in demanding permission for the people to go and serve their God (<a href="/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>); and it was not till Pharaoh offered to allow them to sacrifice in the land that Moses replied, "We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God" (<a href="/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>); but, observe, with this proviso, "as He shall command us," which left, under the circumstances, no hope that they would return. It was an act of mercy to Pharaoh, therefore, on the one hand, that the entire departure of the Israelites was not demanded at the very first audience of Moses and the representatives of the nation; for, had this been demanded, it would have been far more difficult for him to bend his heart in obedience to the divine will, than when the request presented was as trifling as it was reasonable. And if he had rendered obedience to the will of God in the smaller, God would have given him strength to be faithful in the greater. On the other hand, as God foresaw his resistance (<a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>), this condescension, which demanded no more than the natural man could have performed, was also to answer the purpose of clearly displaying the justice of God. It was to prove alike to Egyptians and Israelites that Pharaoh was "without excuse," and that his eventual destruction was the well-merited punishment of his obduracy.<p>(Note: "This moderate request was made only at the period of the earlier plagues. It served to put Pharaoh to the proof. God did not come forth with His whole plan and desire at first, that his obduracy might appear so much the more glaring, and find no excuse in the greatness of the requirement. Had Pharaoh granted this request, Israel would not have gone beyond it; but had not God foreseen, what He repeatedly says (compare, for instance, <a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>), that he would not comply with it, He would not thus have presented it; He would from the beginning have revealed His whole design. Thus Augustine remarks (Quaest. 13 in Ex.)." Hengstenberg, Diss. on the Pentateuch. vol. ii. p. 427, Ryland's translation. Clark, 1847.)<p>&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "not even by means of a strong hand;" "except through great power" is not the true rendering, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; does not mean &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;, nisi. What follows, - viz., the statement that God would so smite the Egyptians with miracles that Pharaoh would, after all, let Israel go (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>), - is not really at variance with this, the only admissible rendering of the words. For the meaning is, that Pharaoh would not be willing to let Israel depart even when he should be smitten by the strong hand of God; but that he would be compelled to do so against his will, would be forced to do so by the plagues that were about to fall upon Egypt. Thus even after the ninth plague it is still stated (<a href="/exodus/10-27.htm">Exodus 10:27</a>), that "Pharaoh would (&#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) not let them go;" and when he had given permission, in consequence of the last plague, and in fact had driven them out (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), he speedily repented, and pursued them with his army to bring them back again (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a>.); from which it is clearly to be seen that the strong hand of God had not broken his will, and yet Israel was brought out by the same strong hand of Jehovah. </body></html>
