Here, in J, it is represented as the shepherd’s staff which was naturally in Moses’ hands, and it becomes the medium of the display of the divine power to him. In E it is apparently given him by God (<span class="ital">v.</span> 17), and consequently bears the name ‘rod of God’ (<span class="ital">v.</span> 20b): as such, it is the instrument with which Moses achieves the wonders, <a href="/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a> b, <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:23</a>, <a href="/exodus/10-13.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.">Exodus 10:13</a>’ (C.-H.; cf. below, p. 56).

Or "a staff." Some suppose the ordinary shepherd's staff, or crook, to be meant; but it is objected that this would have been an unfit object to have brought into the presence of Pharaoh (Kalisch), being unsuitable for a court, and emblematic of an occupation which the Egyptians loathed (<a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>); and the suggestion is therefore made, that it was the <span class="accented">baton</span> or long stick commonly carried by Egyptians of good position and especially by persons in authority. But Moses in Midian, forty years after he quitted Egypt, is not likely to have possessed such an article; nor, if he had possessed it, would he have taken it with him when shepherding. Probably a simple staff, the natural support of a man of advanced years, is meant. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the command, "Go and gather the elders of Israel together," God then gave Moses further instructions with reference to the execution of his mission. On his arrival in Egypt he was first of all to inform the elders, as the representatives of the nation (i.e., the heads of the families, households, and tribes), of the appearance of God to him, and the revelation of His design, to deliver His people out of Egypt and bring them to the land of the Canaanites. He was then to go with them to Pharaoh, and make known to him their resolution, in consequence of this appearance of God, to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God. The words, "I have surely visited," point to the fulfilment of the last words of the dying Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>) does not mean "He is named upon us" (lxx, Onk., Jon.), nor "He has called us" (Vulg., Luth.). The latter is grammatically wrong, for the verb is Niphal, or passive; and though the former has some support in the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>, inasmuch as &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is the verb used there, it is only in appearance, for if the meaning really were "His name is named upon (over) us," the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;) would not be omitted (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The real meaning is, "He has met with us," from &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, obruam fieri, ordinarily construed with &#1488;&#1500;, but here with &#1506;&#1500;, because God comes down from above to meet with man. The plural us is used, although it was only to Moses that God appeared, because His appearing had reference to the whole nation, which was represented before Pharaoh by Moses and the elders. In the words &#1504;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, "we will go, then," equivalent to "let us go," the request for Pharaoh's permission to go out is couched in such a form as to answer to the relation of Israel to Pharaoh. He had no right to detain them, but he had a right to consent to their departure, as his predecessor had formerly done to their settlement. Still less had he any good reason for refusing their request to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God, since their return at the close of the festival was then taken for granted. But the purpose of God was, that Israel should not return. Was it the case, then, that the delegates were "to deceive the king," as Knobel affirms! By no means. God knew the hard heart of Pharaoh, and therefore directed that no more should be asked at first than he must either grant, or display the hardness of his heart. Had he consented, God would then have made known to him His whole design, and demanded that His people should be allowed to depart altogether. But when Pharaoh scornfully refused the first and smaller request (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5</a>), Moses was instructed to demand the entire departure of Israel from the land (<a href="/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and to show the omnipotence of the God of the Hebrews before and upon Pharaoh by miracles and heavy judgments (<a href="/hebrews/7-8.htm">Hebrews 7:8</a>.). Accordingly, Moses persisted in demanding permission for the people to go and serve their God (<a href="/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>); and it was not till Pharaoh offered to allow them to sacrifice in the land that Moses replied, "We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God" (<a href="/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>); but, observe, with this proviso, "as He shall command us," which left, under the circumstances, no hope that they would return. It was an act of mercy to Pharaoh, therefore, on the one hand, that the entire departure of the Israelites was not demanded at the very first audience of Moses and the representatives of the nation; for, had this been demanded, it would have been far more difficult for him to bend his heart in obedience to the divine will, than when the request presented was as trifling as it was reasonable. And if he had rendered obedience to the will of God in the smaller, God would have given him strength to be faithful in the greater. On the other hand, as God foresaw his resistance (<a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>), this condescension, which demanded no more than the natural man could have performed, was also to answer the purpose of clearly displaying the justice of God. It was to prove alike to Egyptians and Israelites that Pharaoh was "without excuse," and that his eventual destruction was the well-merited punishment of his obduracy.<p>(Note: "This moderate request was made only at the period of the earlier plagues. It served to put Pharaoh to the proof. God did not come forth with His whole plan and desire at first, that his obduracy might appear so much the more glaring, and find no excuse in the greatness of the requirement. Had Pharaoh granted this request, Israel would not have gone beyond it; but had not God foreseen, what He repeatedly says (compare, for instance, <a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>), that he would not comply with it, He would not thus have presented it; He would from the beginning have revealed His whole design. Thus Augustine remarks (Quaest. 13 in Ex.)." Hengstenberg, Diss. on the Pentateuch. vol. ii. p. 427, Ryland's translation. Clark, 1847.)<p>&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "not even by means of a strong hand;" "except through great power" is not the true rendering, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; does not mean &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;, nisi. What follows, - viz., the statement that God would so smite the Egyptians with miracles that Pharaoh would, after all, let Israel go (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>), - is not really at variance with this, the only admissible rendering of the words. For the meaning is, that Pharaoh would not be willing to let Israel depart even when he should be smitten by the strong hand of God; but that he would be compelled to do so against his will, would be forced to do so by the plagues that were about to fall upon Egypt. Thus even after the ninth plague it is still stated (<a href="/exodus/10-27.htm">Exodus 10:27</a>), that "Pharaoh would (&#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) not let them go;" and when he had given permission, in consequence of the last plague, and in fact had driven them out (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), he speedily repented, and pursued them with his army to bring them back again (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a>.); from which it is clearly to be seen that the strong hand of God had not broken his will, and yet Israel was brought out by the same strong hand of Jehovah. </body></html>
