It is not unlikely that they were at that time all grown up. If Levi lived to be “an hundred thirty and seven years” old, he would probably before he died have seen his descendants of the fifth generation. Attempts have been made to show that the present genealogy is complete, and that Moses was Levi’s great-grandson. But in Joshua’s case there were ten generations (at least) between him and Jacob (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-23.htm" title="And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.">1Chronicles 7:23-27</a>); so that three generations only between Jacob and Moses are scarcely possible. The Israelites were in the habit of constructing their genealogies by omitting some of the links, as we see plainly in the genealogy of Ezra (<a href="/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) and in St. Matthew’s genealogy of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/1-8.htm" title="And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;">Matthew 1:8</a>). In this present genealogy four or five (perhaps more) names are probably omitted between Amram, the son of Kohath. and Amram, the father of Moses, as will appear if we model the genealogy of Moses upon that of Joshua.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">The sons of Gershon.</span>—From this point the genealogy is no longer a recapitulation, but an original historical document of first-rate importance, which is confirmed by Numbers (<a href="/context/numbers/3-18.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.">Numbers 3:18-33</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-17.htm" title="And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and Shimei.">1Chronicles 6:17-19</a>). It is remarkable that Gershon had but two sons, Kohath but four, and Merari but two. Yet the Levites in the year after the Exodus numbered 22,300 males (<a href="/numbers/3-22.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 3:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-28.htm" title="In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:28</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-34.htm" title="And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 3:34</a>).

The age of Levi, Kohath, and Amram, the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of Moses, is here recorded; and they all lived to a great age; Levi to one hundred thirty-seven, Kohath to one hundred thirty- three, and Amram to one hundred thirty-seven: Moses himself came much short of them, and fixed seventy or eighty for the ordinary stretch of human life, <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm" title="The days of our years are three score years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.">Psalm 90:10</a>. For now Israel was multiplied, and become a great nation, and divine revelation was by the hand of Moses committed to writing, and no longer trusted to tradition; therefore the two great reasons for the long lives of the patriarchs were ceased, and from henceforward fewer years must serve men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much.

The insertion of this genealogical table in this part of the narrative was intended to authenticate the descent of Moses and Aaron. Both of them were commissioned to act so important a part in the events transacted in the court of Egypt and afterwards elevated to so high offices in the government and Church of God, that it was of the utmost importance that their lineage should be accurately traced. Reuben and Simeon being the oldest of Jacob's sons, a passing notice is taken of them, and then the historian advances to the enumeration of the principal persons in the house of Levi [Ex 6:16-19].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1619</span> From each of which proceeded a distinct generation or family called by their father’s name. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations,....

Jarchi says, that the reason why, the years of the life of Levi are reckoned is to show how long the bondage lasted; for there was no servitude as long as any of the tribes (or of the sons of Jacob) remained, according to <a href="/exodus/1-6.htm">Exodus 1:6</a> and the Jewish chronologers (d) affirm that Levi was the last of the patriarchs that died; and that he died in the year of the world 3332, and lived in Egypt ninety four years; and from his time, to the going out of Egypt, were only one hundred and sixteen years; and they further say the bondage could not last longer than one hundred and sixteen years, nor shorter than eighty seven. Bishop Usher (e) places his death in A.

This phrase is introduced because the writer does not here stop at the sons, but proceeds on to the grandsons, great-grandsons, and other descendants. (See vers. 17-25.) He is concerned especially in this place with the descent of Moses, and therefore with the genealogy of the tribe of Levi, and has only inserted any account of the families descended from Reuben and Simeon, that he might not seem to disregard the claims of primogeniture. <span class="cmt_word">The years of the life of Levi</span>. These began about forty or fifty years before the descent into Egypt, which took place after the birth of all his three sons, as appears front <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-11</a>.

Thus the early belief of the Israelites was changed into the despondency of unbelief through the increase of their oppression. This result also produced despondency in Moses' mind, so that he once more declined the commission, which followed the promise, viz., to go to Pharaoh and demand that he would let Israel go out of his land (<a href="/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>). If the children of Israel would not listen to him, how should Pharaoh hear him, especially as he was uncircumcised in the lips (<a href="/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>)? &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1512;&#1500; is one whose lips are, as it were, covered with a foreskin, so that he cannot easily bring out his words; in meaning the same as "heavy of mouth" in <a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>. The reply of God to this objection is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1-5</a>. For, before the historian gives the decisive answer of Jehovah which removed all further hesitation on the part of Moses, and completed his mission and that of Aaron to Pharaoh, he considers it advisable to introduce the genealogy of the two men of God, for the purpose of showing clearly their genealogical relation to the people of Israel. </body></html>
