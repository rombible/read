Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God Almighty - Rather, "El Shaddai," (&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l shadday), it is better to keep this as a proper name. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Am not I, the Almighty God, who pledged My honor for the fulfilment of the covenant, also the self-existent God who lives to accomplish it? Rest assured, therefore, that I shall bring it to pass. This passage has occasioned much discussion; and it has been thought by many to intimate that as the name Jehovah was not known to the patriarchs, at least in the full bearing or practical experience of it, the honor of the disclosure was reserved to Moses, who was the first sent with a message in the name of Jehovah, and enabled to attest it by a series of public miracles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,....

"To give a sword into their hand to kill us." Moses and Aaron, they imagined, through their appeal to Pharaoh had made the king and his counsellors suspect them of being restless people, and so had put a weapon into their hands for their oppression and destruction. What perversity of the natural heart! They call upon God to judge, whilst by their very complaining they show that they have no confidence in God and His power to save. Moses turned (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; <a href="/exodus/5-22.htm">Exodus 5:22</a>) to Jehovah with the question, "Why hast Thou done evil to this people," - increased their oppression by my mission to Pharaoh, and yet not delivered them? "These are not words of contumacy or indignation, but of inquiry and prayer" (Aug. quaest. 14). The question and complaint proceeded from faith, which flies to God when it cannot understand the dealings of God, to point out to Him how incomprehensible are His ways, to appeal to Him to help in the time of need, and to remove what seems opposed to His nature and His will. </body></html>
