They occupy quite as prominent a position in Arabian as in Jewish history. The descent of a man who aspired to be a leader would be a subject of curiosity, with a Semitic people, to all those who submitted themselves to his guidance; and Moses naturally inserts his at the point where, fully accepting the post of leader, he came forward and commenced his struggle with Pharaoh for the emancipation of his nation. A “father’s house” is a family. (See <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm" title="Take you the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-18.htm" title="And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.">Numbers 1:18</a>.)<p>(14, 15) <span class= "bld">Reuben . . . Simeon.</span>—It fixes the position of the family of Levi in the house of Jacob to commence the genealogy with a mention of the two elder brothers. As, however, the writer is really concerned only with the Levites, the families of Reuben and Simeon are dismissed with the briefest possible notice. Nothing new is rocorded of them. (See <a href="/context/genesis/46-9.htm" title="And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.">Genesis 46:9-10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/6-14.htm" title="These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.">Exodus 6:14</a></span>. This genealogy ends in those two great patriots, Moses and Aaron, and comes in here to show that they were Israelites, bone of the bone, and flesh of the flesh of those whom they were sent to deliver; raised up unto them of their brethern, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the house of Israel, and whose genealogy also, like this, was to be carefully preserved. The heads of the houses of three of the tribes are here named, agreeing with the accounts we had, Genesis 46. Reuben and Simeon seem to be mentioned only for the sake of Levi, from whom Moses and Aaron descended, and all the priests of the Jewish Church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much.

The insertion of this genealogical table in this part of the narrative was intended to authenticate the descent of Moses and Aaron. Both of them were commissioned to act so important a part in the events transacted in the court of Egypt and afterwards elevated to so high offices in the government and Church of God, that it was of the utmost importance that their lineage should be accurately traced. Reuben and Simeon being the oldest of Jacob's sons, a passing notice is taken of them, and then the historian advances to the enumeration of the principal persons in the house of Levi [Ex 6:16-19].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This genealogy he describes here, to show the lineage of Moses and Aaron, by. whom this great work was to be effected. Only he promiseth in brief the genealogy of his two elder brethren. Reuben and Simeon, to make way for the third, which he intended more largely to insist upon. And he mentions them rather than any other, either to advance the favour of God in preferring that tribe before the descendants of their elder brethren; or to show that, although the parents were sharply censured, and rather cursed than blessed by Jacob, <span class="bld"> Ge 49</span>, yet their posterity was not rejected by God, but received to mercy, and admitted to the same privilege with their brethren. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These be the heads of their father's houses,.... Not of the families of Moses and Aaron, but of the children of Israel, though only the heads of three tribes are mentioned; and some think that these three are taken notice of, to show that they were not rejected of God, though they seem to be rather cursed than blessed by Jacob; and that though they were guilty of very great crimes, as Reuben of incest, and Simeon and Levi of murder, yet they truly repented, and obtained mercy of God, and were honoured in their offspring, of whom an account is here given; but the two first seem to be taken notice of for the sake of the third, and that order might be observed, and that it might plainly appear that the deliverers of Israel were Israelites: <p>the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; whose names, and the order in which they are put, are the same as in <a href="/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a> these be the families of Reuben; the heads of them, or from whence they sprung. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These <i>be</i> the heads <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these <i>be</i> the families of Reuben.</span><p>(e) This genealogy shows whom Moses and Aaron came from.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">These are the heads of their fathers’ houses</span>] The form of superscription, as often in P; e.g. <a href="/genesis/10-1.htm" title="Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-10.htm" title="These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:">Genesis 11:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm" title="And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.">Genesis 46:8</a>, <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.">Exodus 1:1</a>, <a href="/numbers/1-5.htm" title="And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 1:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-4.htm" title="And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.">Numbers 13:4</a>, &c. ‘Fathers’ house’ is an expression which occurs frequently in P and Chronicles, especially in connexion with genealogies.
