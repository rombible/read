Later on we learn that the redemption was accomplished in a twofold way—(1) by the long series of wonders, culminating in the tenth plague, whereby they were taken out of Pharaoh’s hand, and ceased to be his slaves, becoming instead the servants of God; and (2) by being led through the Red Sea, and thus delivered, one and all, from impending death, and so purchased anew. (See <a href="/context/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13-16</a>.)

Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With a stretched out arm - The figure is common and quite intelligible; it may have struck Moses and the people the more forcibly since they were familiar with the hieroglyphic which represents might by two outstretched arms. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

God felt for the disappointment which the people had suffered in finding no alleviation of their toils, but the reverse, after their hopes had been raised high by the words of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). He therefore sent them an inspiriting and gracious message. "They <span class="accented">should</span> be rid of their bondage; they <span class="accented">should</span> be brought out; they <span class="accented">should</span> be redeemed and delivered by his mighty arm and miraculous intervention.

Faith would lay hold on this assurance and cling to it, even though God still delayed his coming, and did not precipitate matters. <span class="cmt_word">A stretched-out arm</span>. Arms are stretched out by men to help and save. An outstretched arm in the Egyptian writing meant "action." The phrase, elsewhere so common, is here used for the first time. (Compare, however, <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>.) It was significant of active, energetic help. <span class="cmt_word">Great judgments</span>. These had been previously hinted at (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> and <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>) but had not been previously called "judgments." Compare <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>: "Also that nation whom they serve will I judge." The plagues of Egypt were not merely "wonders," but punishments inflicted on a proud and cruel nation by a Judge. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Jehovah look upon you and judge" (i.e., punish you, because) "ye have made the smell of us to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants," i.e., destroyed our good name with the king and his servants, and turned it into hatred and disgust. &#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, a pleasant smell, is a figure employed for a good name or repute, and the figurative use of the word explains the connection with the eyes instead of the nose. "To give a sword into their hand to kill us." Moses and Aaron, they imagined, through their appeal to Pharaoh had made the king and his counsellors suspect them of being restless people, and so had put a weapon into their hands for their oppression and destruction. What perversity of the natural heart! They call upon God to judge, whilst by their very complaining they show that they have no confidence in God and His power to save. Moses turned (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; <a href="/exodus/5-22.htm">Exodus 5:22</a>) to Jehovah with the question, "Why hast Thou done evil to this people," - increased their oppression by my mission to Pharaoh, and yet not delivered them? "These are not words of contumacy or indignation, but of inquiry and prayer" (Aug. quaest. 14). The question and complaint proceeded from faith, which flies to God when it cannot understand the dealings of God, to point out to Him how incomprehensible are His ways, to appeal to Him to help in the time of need, and to remove what seems opposed to His nature and His will. </body></html>
