Joshua, unsuspicious of the real nature of the shouting, supposed, naturally enough, that the camp was attacked by an enemy, and that the noise was “a noise of war.” But Moses, forewarned of the actual state of affairs (<a href="/context/exodus/32-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:">Exodus 32:7-8</a>), had probably a shrewd suspicion of the real nature of the sounds.
