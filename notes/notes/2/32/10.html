Sin is the corruption of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust. They had turned aside out of the way. Sin is a departing from the way of duty into a by-path. They soon forgot God's works. He sees what they cannot discover, nor is any wickedness of the world hid from him. We could not bear to see the thousandth part of that evil which God sees every day. God expresses the greatness of his just displeasure, after the manner of men who would have prayer of Moses could save them from ruin; thus he was a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone, God would reconcile the world to himself. Moses pleads God's glory. The glorifying God's name, as it ought to be our first petition, and it is so in the Lord's prayer, so it ought to be our great plea. And God's promises are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised he is able to perform. See the power of prayer. In answer to the prayers of Moses, God showed his purpose of sparing the people, as he had before seemed determined on their destruction; which change of the outward discovery of his purpose, is called repenting of the evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let me alone - But Moses did not let the Lord alone; he wrestled, as Jacob had done, until, like Jacob, he obtained the blessing <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-29</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. make of thee a great nation&#8212;Care must be taken not to suppose this language as betokening any change or vacillation in the divine purpose.

Out of the many attempts that have been made at interpreting the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1496; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, there are only two that deserve any notice, viz., the one adopted by Bochart and Schroeder, "he bound it up in a bag," and the one given by the earlier translators, "he fashioned (&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, as in <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>) the gold with the chisel." No doubt &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;) does occur in the sense of binding in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1496; may certainly be used for &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1496; a bag; but why should Aaron first tie up the golden ear-rings in a bag? And if he did so, why this superfluous and incongruous allusion to the fact? We give in our adhesion to the second, which is adopted by the lxx, Onkelos, the Syriac, and even Jonathan, though the other rendering is also interpolated into the text. Such objections, as that the calf is expressly spoken of as molten work, or that files are used, and not chisels, for giving a finer finish to casts, have no force whatever. The latter is not even correct. A graving-knife is quite as necessary as a file for chiselling, and giving a finer finish to things cast in a mould; and cheret does not necessarily mean a chisel, but may signify any tool employed for carving, engraving, and shaping hard metals. The other objection rests upon the supposition that massecah means an image made entirely of metal (e.g., gold). But this cannot be sustained. Apart from the fact, that most of the larger idols worshipped by the ancients had a wooden centre, and were merely covered with gold plate, such passages as <a href="/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a> prove, not only that the casting of gold for idols consisted merely in casting the metal into a flat sheet, which the goldsmith hammered out and spread into a coating of gold plate, but also that a wooden image, when covered in this way with a coating of gold, was actually called massecah. And Aaron's molten calf was also made in this way: it was first of all formed of wood, and then covered with gold plate. This is evident from the way in which it was destroyed: the image was first of all burnt, and then beaten or crushed to pieces, and pounded or ground to powder (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>); i.e., the wooden centre was first burnt into charcoal, and then the golden covering beaten or rubbed to pieces (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a> compared with <a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>).<p>The "golden calf" (&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; a young bull) was copied from the Egyptian Apis (vid., Hengstenberg, Dissertations); but for all that, it was not the image of an Egyptian deity-it was no symbol of the generative or bearing power of nature, but an image of Jehovah. For when it was finished, those who had made the image, and handed it over to the people, said, "This is thy God (pluralis majest.), O Israel, who brought thee out of Egypt." This is the explanation adopted in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-19.htm">Psalm 106:19-20</a>.</body></html>
