Not having the courage to meet the demand of the people with a direct negative, he may have aimed at diverting them from their purpose by requiring a sacrifice which they would be unwilling to make, viz., the personal ornaments of their wives and children.

Some suppose that when Aaron gave this direction he did it with a design to crush the proposal, believing, that if their covetousness did not hinder them from giving up their ear-rings, their pride, at least, would prevent their parting with them. He says, therefore, <span class="ital">Which are in the ears of your wives and daughters — </span>Thinking them most fond of their jewels, and most unlikely to part with them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-6 While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the people made a tumultuous address to Aaron. This giddy multitude were weary of waiting for the return of Moses. Weariness in waiting betrays to many temptations. The Lord must be waited for till he comes, and waited for though he tarry. Let their readiness to part with their ear-rings to make an idol, shame our niggardliness in the service of the true God. They did not draw back on account of the cost of their idolatry; and shall we grudge the expenses of religion? Aaron produced the shape of an ox or calf, giving it some finish with a graving tool. They offered sacrifice to this idol. Having set up an image before them, and so changed the truth of God into a lie, their sacrifices were abomination. Had they not, only a few days before, in this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the midst of the fire, Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image? Had they not themselves solemnly entered into covenant with God, that they would do all he had said to them, and would be obedient? ch. 24:7. Yet before they stirred from the place where this covenant had been solemnly made, they brake an express command, in defiance of an express threatening. It plainly shows, that the law was no more able to make holy, than it was to justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not the cure of sin. Aaron was set apart by the Divine appointment to the office of the priesthood; but he, who had once shamed himself so far as to build an altar to a golden calf, must own himself unworthy of the honour of attending at the altar of God, and indebted to free grace alone for it. Thus pride and boasting were silenced.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Break off the golden earrings - It has been very generally held from early times, that Aaron did not willingly lend himself to the mad design of the multitude; but that, overcome by their importunity, he asked them to give up such possessions as he knew they would not willingly part with, in the hope of putting a check on them. Assuming this to have been his purpose, he took a wrong measure of their fanaticism, for all the people made the sacrifice at once <a href="/exodus/32-3.htm">Exodus 32:3</a>. His weakness, in any case, was unpardonable and called for the intercession of Moses <a href="/deuteronomy/9-20.htm">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Aaron said, &#8230; Break off &#8230; earrings&#8212;It was not an Egyptian custom for young men to wear earrings, and the circumstance, therefore, seems to point out "the mixed rabble," who were chiefly foreign slaves, as the ringleaders in this insurrection. In giving direction to break their earrings, Aaron probably calculated on gaining time; or, perhaps, on their covetousness and love of finery proving stronger than their idolatrous propensity. If such were his expectations, they were doomed to signal disappointment. Better to have calmly and earnestly remonstrated with them, or to have preferred duty to expediency, leaving the issue in the hands of Providence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The golden earrings</span> were of good value and common use among the eastern people, who seem to have used them superstitiously, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a> <a href="/judges/8-24.htm" title="And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his prey.

It is implied that the men did not wear earrings. At an earlier date the household of Jacob, chiefly men, had worn them (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2-3</a>). God concludes by enforcing the observance of His Sabbaths in the most solemn manner, repeating the threat of death and extermination in the case of every transgressor. The repetition and further development of this command, which was included already in the decalogue, is quite in its proper place here, inasmuch as the thought might easily have occurred, that it was allowable to omit the keeping of the Sabbath, when the execution of so great a work in honour of Jehovah had been commanded. "My Sabbaths:" by these we are to understand the weekly Sabbaths, not the other sabbatical festivals, since the words which follow apply to the weekly Sabbath alone. This was "a sign between Jehovah and Israel for all generations, to know (i.e., by which Israel might learn) that it was Jehovah who sanctified them," viz., by the sabbatical rest (see at <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>). It was therefore a holy thing for Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>), the desecration of which would be followed by the punishment of death, as a breach of the covenant. The kernel of the Sabbath commandment is repeated in <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>; the seventh day of the week, however, is not simply designated a "Sabbath," but &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; "a high Sabbath" (the repetition of the same word, or of an abstract form of the concrete noun, denoting the superlative; see Ges. 113, 2), and "holy to Jehovah" (see at <a href="/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>). For this reason Israel was to keep it in all future generations, i.e., to observe it as an eternal covenant (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16</a>), as in the case of circumcision, since it was to be a sign for ever between Jehovah and the children of Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/20-20.htm">Ezekiel 20:20</a>). The eternal duration of this sign was involved in the signification of the sabbatical rest, which is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>, and reaches forward into eternity. </body></html>
