A similar phrase to that here used has the sense of “bound in a bag” in <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm" title="And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.">2Kings 5:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">After he had made it a molten calf.</span>—This is a quite impossible rendering. The original gives “and,” not “after.” The action of this clause must either be simultaneous with that of the last or subsequent. Translate, <span class= "ital">and made it into a molten calf.</span><p><span class= "bld">A molten calf.</span>—It has been usual to regard the selection of the “calf” form for the image as due to Egyptian influences. But the Egyptian calf-worship, or, rather, bull-worship, was not a worship of images, but of living animals. A sacred bull, called Apis, was worshipped at Memphis, and another, called Mnevis, at Heliopolis, both being regarded as actual incarnate deities. Had Egyptian ideas been in the ascendant, it would have been natural to select a living bull, which might have “gone before” the people literally. The “molten calf,” which had no very exact counterpart in Egypt, perhaps points back to an older idolatry, such as is glanced at in <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>, where the Israelites are warned to “put away the gods which their fathers served on the other side of the flood,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the Euphrates. Certainly the bull form was more distinctive of the Babylonian and Assyrian than of the Egyptian worship, and it may he suspected that the emigrants from Chaldæa had clung through all their wanderings to the mystic symbolism which had been elaborated in that primæval land, and which they would contrast favourably with the coarse animal worship of Egypt. In Chaldæa, the bull, generally winged and human-headed, represented the combination of wisdom, strength, and omnipresence, which characterises divinity; and this combination might well have seemed to carnal minds no unapt symbol of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">These be thy gods.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">This is thy god.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/32-4.htm" title="And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">He made it a molten calf — </span>He melted it down, and, having a mould prepared, poured the melted gold into it, and then produced it in the shape of an <span class="ital">ox </span>or <span class="ital">calf </span>giving it some finishing strokes with a graving tool. “They made a calf,” says David, “in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image: they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.” It is probable that the origin of this idolatry was from Egypt. The Scriptures inform us that the Israelites in Egypt imitated the Egyptian superstitions, <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/20-7.htm" title="Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God....">Ezekiel 20:7-8</a>. Now that the Egyptians worshipped animals as early as these days, appears from <a href="/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a>. An ox or calf in particular was their great idol. So that we may with certainty conclude, notwithstanding what some late commentators have alleged, that Aaron, in compliance with the prejudices of the people, made this calf after the model of what the Israelites had seen in Egypt, consecrating it to Jehovah as the Egyptians had consecrated similar symbols to their principal deity Osiris. Aaron’s compliance with the popular clamour was, undoubtedly, highly criminal: he ought to have opposed them with all his might, nay, he ought rather to have suffered death than to have yielded to their will in any degree. Accordingly, we find it recorded, (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-20.htm" title="And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>,) that “the Lord was very angry with him to have destroyed him,” but that Moses “prayed for him.” They said, <span class="ital">These be thy gods — </span>Or as Nehemiah expresses, (<a href="/nehemiah/9-18.htm" title="Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had worked great provocations;">Nehemiah 9:18</a>,) This is thy God; that is, This is the <span class="ital">image </span>or symbol of thy God; who <span class="ital">brought thee out of Egypt — </span>For they intended to worship the true God, by this image, as afterward Jeroboam did by the same image, it being incredible that the generality of the Israelites should be so void of all sense and reason, as to think that this new-made calf brought them out of Egypt, even before its own creation, and that this was the same Jehovah that had so lately spoken to them from heaven with an audible voice, saying, “I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-6 While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the people made a tumultuous address to Aaron. This giddy multitude were weary of waiting for the return of Moses. Weariness in waiting betrays to many temptations. The Lord must be waited for till he comes, and waited for though he tarry. Let their readiness to part with their ear-rings to make an idol, shame our niggardliness in the service of the true God. They did not draw back on account of the cost of their idolatry; and shall we grudge the expenses of religion? Aaron produced the shape of an ox or calf, giving it some finish with a graving tool. They offered sacrifice to this idol. Having set up an image before them, and so changed the truth of God into a lie, their sacrifices were abomination. Had they not, only a few days before, in this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the midst of the fire, Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image? Had they not themselves solemnly entered into covenant with God, that they would do all he had said to them, and would be obedient? ch. 24:7. Yet before they stirred from the place where this covenant had been solemnly made, they brake an express command, in defiance of an express threatening. It plainly shows, that the law was no more able to make holy, than it was to justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not the cure of sin. Aaron was set apart by the Divine appointment to the office of the priesthood; but he, who had once shamed himself so far as to build an altar to a golden calf, must own himself unworthy of the honour of attending at the altar of God, and indebted to free grace alone for it. Thus pride and boasting were silenced.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense approved by most modern critics is: and he received the gold at their hand and collected it in a bag and made it a molten calf. The Israelites must have been familiar with the ox-worship of the Egyptians; perhaps many of them had witnessed the rites of Mnevis at Heliopolis, almost; on the borders of the land of Goshen, and they could not have been unacquainted with the more famous rites of Apis at Memphis. It is expressly said that they yielded to the idolatry of Egypt while they were in bondage <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-8.htm">Ezekiel 20:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>; and this is in keeping with the earliest Jewish tradition (Philo). In the next verse, Aaron appears to speak of the calf as if it was a representative of Yahweh - "Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord." The Israelites did not, it should be noted, worship a living Mnevis, or Apis, having a proper name, but only the golden type of the animal. The mystical notions connected with the ox by the Egyptian priests may have possessed their minds, and, when expressed in this modified and less gross manner, may have been applied to the Lord, who had really delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. Their sin then lay, not in their adopting another god, but in their pretending to worship a visible symbol of Him whom no symbol could represent. The close connection between the calves of Jeroboam and this calf is shown by the repetition of the formula, "which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>.<p>These be thy gods - This is thy god. See <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf&#8212;The words are transposed, and the rendering should be, "he framed with a graving tool the image to be made, and having poured the liquid gold into the mould, he made it a molten calf." It is not said whether it was of life size, whether it was of solid gold or merely a wooden frame covered with plates of gold. This idol seems to have been the god Apis, the chief deity of the Egyptians, worshipped at Memphis under the form of a live ox, three years old. It was distinguished by a triangular white spot on its forehead and other peculiar marks. Images of it in the form of a whole ox, or of a calf's head on the end of a pole, were very common; and it makes a great figure on the monuments where it is represented in the van of all processions, as borne aloft on men's shoulders.<p>they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt&#8212;It is inconceivable that they, who but a few weeks before had witnessed such amazing demonstrations of the true God, could have suddenly sunk to such a pitch of infatuation and brutish stupidity, as to imagine that human art or hands could make a god that should go before them. But it must be borne in mind, that though by election and in name they were the people of God, they were as yet, in feelings and associations, in habits and tastes, little, if at all different, from Egyptians. They meant the calf to be an image, a visible sign or symbol of Jehovah, so that their sin consisted not in a breach of the FIRST [Ex 20:3], but of the SECOND commandment [Ex 20:4-6].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A molten calf</span>: the meaning of this translation is, that Aaron, to wit, by artificers, did first melt the god into one mass, and then by the graving-tool form it into the shape of a calf, and polish it; or as others render the words, he <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">formed it in a type or mould</span>, made in the shape of a <span class="ital">calf</span>, into which he cast the molten gold, <span class="ital">and so made it a molten calf</span>.

The great idols of the Egyptians, Apis, Seraphis, and Isis, were oxen and cows, as is confessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The Egyptians, besides the creatures which they adored as gods, did also make, and keep, and worship their images, as even the heathen writers, Mela and Strabo, affirm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The Israelites, whilst they were in Egypt, were many of them infected with the Egyptian idolatry, as it appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a> <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm" title="Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Ezekiel 20:7</a>,8 23:3 <a href="/acts/7-39.htm" title="To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,">Acts 7:39</a></span>. And it is not unlikely divers of them hankered no less after the idols, than after the garlic and onions of Egypt. And being now, as they thought, forsaken by Moses, they might think of returning to Egypt, as afterwards they did, and therefore chose a god of the Egyptian mode, that they might more willingly receive them again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">These be thy gods</span>, i.e. this is thy god, the plural number being put for the singular, as it is usual in this case.

So they intended to worship the true God by this image, as afterwards Jeroboam did by the same image, as we shall plainly see when we come to that place of Scripture. And it is absolutely incredible that the generality of the Israelites should be so void of all sense and reason, as to think that this new-made calf did bring them out Egypt before its own creation, and that this was the same Jehovah who had even now spoken to them from heaven with an audible voice, saying, <span class="ital">I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he received them at their hand,.... For the use they delivered them to him: <p>and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf; that is, after he had melted the gold, and cast it into a mould, which gave it the figure of a calf, and with his tool wrought it into a more agreeable form, he took off the roughness of it, and polished it; or if it was in imitation of the Egyptian Apis or Osiris, he might with his graving tool engrave such marks and figures as were upon that; to cause the greater resemblance, so Selden (y) thinks; see Gill on <a href="/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a> or else the sense may be, that he drew the figure of a calf with his tool, or made it in "a mould" (z), into which he poured in the melted gold: <p>and made it a molten calf; the Targum of Jonathan gives another sense of the former clause, "he bound it up in a napkin"; in a linen cloth or bag, i.e. the gold of the ear rings, and then put it into the melting pot, and so cast it into a mould, and made a calf of it. Jarchi takes notice of this sense, and it is espoused by Bochart (a), who produces two passages of Scripture for the confirmation of it, <a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a> and illustrates it by <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>. What inclined Aaron to make it in the form of a calf, is not easy to say; whether in imitation of the cherubim, one of the faces of which was that of an ox, as Moncaeus thought; or whether in imitation of the Osiris of the Egyptians, who was worshipped in a living ox, and sometimes in the image of one, even a golden one. Plutarch is express for it, and says (b), that the ox was an image of Osiris, and that it was a golden one; and so says Philo the Jew (c), the Israelites, emulous of Egyptian figments, made a golden ox; or whether he did this to make them ashamed of their idolatry, thinking they would never be guilty of worshipping the form of an ox eating grass, or because an ox was an emblem of power and majesty: <p>and they said, these be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; they own they were, brought up out of that land by the divine Being; and they could not be so stupid as to believe, that this calf, which was only a mass of gold, figured and decorated, was inanimate, had no life nor breath, and was just made, after their coming out of Egypt, was what brought them from hence; but that this was a representation of God, who had done this for them; yet some Jewish writers are so foolish as to suppose, that through art it had the breath of life in it, and came out of the mould a living calf, Satan, or Samael, entering into it, and lowed in it (d). <p>(y) De Diis Syris Syntagm. 1. c. 4. p. 138.

But it is quite consonant with the simplicity of Scripture to mention very trivial circumstances. The act of putting up in bags is mentioned both here and also in <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They said</span>. The fashioners of the image said this. <span class="cmt_word">These be thy gods</span>. Rather, "This is thy God." Why Aaron selected the form of the calf as that which he would present to the Israelites to receive their worship, has been generally explained by supposing that his thoughts reverted to Egypt, and found in the Apis of Memphis or the Mnevis of Hellopolis the pattern which he thought it best to follow. But there are several objections to this view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Egyptian gods had just been discredited by their powerlessness being manifested - it was an odd time at which to fly to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Apis and Mnevis were not molten calves, but live bulls. If the design had been to revert to Egypt, would not a living animal have been selected? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The calf when made was not viewed as an image of any Egyptian god, but as a representation of Jehovah (ver. 5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The Israelites are never taxed with having worshipped the idols of Egypt anywhere else than in Egypt (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-8.htm">Ezekiel 20:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>). To us it seems probable that Aaron reverted to an earlier period than the time of the sojourn in Egypt, that he went back to those "gods on the other side of the flood," which Joshua warned the Israelites some sixty years later, to "put away" (Joshua <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). The subject is one too large for discussion here; but may not the winged and human-headed bull, which was the emblem of divine power from a very early date in Babylon, have retained a place in the recollections of the people in all their wanderings, and have formed a portion of their religions symbolism? May it not have been this conception which lay at the root of the cherubic forms, and the revival of which now seemed to Aaron the smallest departure from pure monotheism with which the people would be contented? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2-3</a>). God concludes by enforcing the observance of His Sabbaths in the most solemn manner, repeating the threat of death and extermination in the case of every transgressor. The repetition and further development of this command, which was included already in the decalogue, is quite in its proper place here, inasmuch as the thought might easily have occurred, that it was allowable to omit the keeping of the Sabbath, when the execution of so great a work in honour of Jehovah had been commanded. "My Sabbaths:" by these we are to understand the weekly Sabbaths, not the other sabbatical festivals, since the words which follow apply to the weekly Sabbath alone. This was "a sign between Jehovah and Israel for all generations, to know (i.e., by which Israel might learn) that it was Jehovah who sanctified them," viz., by the sabbatical rest (see at <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>). It was therefore a holy thing for Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>), the desecration of which would be followed by the punishment of death, as a breach of the covenant. The kernel of the Sabbath commandment is repeated in <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>; the seventh day of the week, however, is not simply designated a "Sabbath," but &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; "a high Sabbath" (the repetition of the same word, or of an abstract form of the concrete noun, denoting the superlative; see Ges. 113, 2), and "holy to Jehovah" (see at <a href="/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>). For this reason Israel was to keep it in all future generations, i.e., to observe it as an eternal covenant (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16</a>), as in the case of circumcision, since it was to be a sign for ever between Jehovah and the children of Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/20-20.htm">Ezekiel 20:20</a>). The eternal duration of this sign was involved in the signification of the sabbatical rest, which is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>, and reaches forward into eternity. </body></html>
