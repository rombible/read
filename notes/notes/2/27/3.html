It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pans - Rather pots as in <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>.
