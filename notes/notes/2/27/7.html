It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The compass of the altar - A shelf or projecting ledge, of convenient width, carried round the altar half way between the top and the base.

These horns were projections at the corners of the altar, formed to imitate in all probability the horns of oxen, and in these the whole force of the altar was concentrated. The blood of the sin-offering was therefore smeared upon them (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>), and those who fled to the altar to save their lives laid hold of them (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; also my commentary on the passage).
