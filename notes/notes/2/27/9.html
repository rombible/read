Such enclosures were particularly affected by the Egyptians, and were usually oblong squares, surrounded by walls, with, for the most part, a single entrance. An open space of this kind, always desirable, was absolutely necessary where the sanctuary itself was covered in, since it would have been intolerable to kill and burn victims in a confined and covered space. The altar which has been described (<a href="/context/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits.">Exodus 27:1-8</a>) was necessarily placed outside the tabernacle, and formed the chief furniture of the court, for which directions are now given.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">For the south side southward.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">for the south side upon the right. </span>(See Note on <a href="/exodus/26-18.htm" title="And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.">Exodus 26:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hangings.</span>—The word used is new and rare.

That parapet consisted of a connected series of curtains, made of fine twined linen yarn, woven into a kind of network, so that the people could see through; but that large curtain which overhung the entrance was of a different texture, being embroidered and dyed with variegated colors, and it was furnished with cords for pulling it up or drawing it aside when the priests had occasion to enter. The curtains of this enclosure were supported on sixty brazen pillars which stood on pedestals of the same metal, but their capitals and fillets were of silver, and the hooks on which they were suspended were of silver also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A court encompassing the tabernacle, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/40-33.htm" title="And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate.

This was a large court yard to the house of God, or tabernacle, which stood in it at the upper end of it; it was enclosed, but open to the air; and in it, between the entrance into it and the holy place, stood the altar of burnt offering before described, and on one side of that the laver for the priests to wash in; into this the people of Israel were admitted, and where they brought their sacrifices and worshipped: it was typical of the visible church of God on earth, which, though an enclosure, and is separated from the world, yet consists of professors, good and bad, of real saints and hypocrites; as into this court Israelites of every character, sex, and state entered. In David's time it was divided into various courts, and what answered to it when the temple was built were the several apartments called the courts of the priests, where they sacrificed, and the court of Israel, where the men Israelites worshipped, and the court of the women, where they were by themselves; and in later times there was another court separate from these, called the court of the Gentiles, into which they might enter; and the description of this court begins with that side of it which lay full south: there shall be <p>hangings for the court of fine twined linen of one hundred cubits long for one side; for the south side; and these hangings, with the rest all around, made the court, and were the walls of it; and from hence we learn, that it was one hundred cubits or fifty yards long, according to the common computation of a cubit; though it was three hundred inches more, this cubit being three inches more than is commonly supposed. These hangings, vails, or curtains, for so in the versions they are differently called, were the enclosure of the court; they were made of fine linen, six times twisted, but not of various colours, and curiously wrought with cunning work, as the curtains of the tabernacle were; and according to the signification of the word, they were wrought full of holes, like eyelet holes, or in the manner of network; so that though they kept persons from entering in, they might be seen through, and through them might be seen what was doing in the court: and all this may signify that the visible church of God on earth is separated from the world, and should consist of men called out of it, and of such who are clothed with that fine linen, clean and white, the righteousness of the saints, and which is the righteousness of Christ, and who have both inward and outward holiness; and though none but those who are admitted members of it may partake of its ordinances, yet others may be spectators of what is done in it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt make the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward <i>there shall be</i> hangings for the court <i>of</i> fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:</span><p>(c) This was the first entry into the tabernacle, where the people abode.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">the south side southward</span>] see on <a href="/exodus/26-18.htm" title="And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.">Exodus 26:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fine twined linen</span>] see on <a href="/exodus/25-4.htm" title="And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,">Exodus 25:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-18.</span> - THE COURT BEFORE THE TABERNACLE. The description of the altar is (as already observed) naturally followed by that of the court which was to contain it, and in which it was to be the most conspicuous object. This is given with great clearness in ten verses, and presents scarcely any problem for solution. The court was an oblong square, three hundred feet in length and seventy-five in breadth. It was enclosed by curtains, hung on sixty pillars, placed at intervals of seven feet and a half apart. The pillars were connected by rods, and each of them fitted into a socket. There was but one entrance, which was at the eastern side, midway in it. It was thirty feet wide, and had its own curtains and its own pillars. These curtains were of similar material with those at the entrance to the tabernacle, but the hangings round the rest of the court were merely of fine white linen. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make the court</span>.

At its four corners shall its horns be from (out of) it," i.e., not removable, but as if growing out of it. These horns were projections at the corners of the altar, formed to imitate in all probability the horns of oxen, and in these the whole force of the altar was concentrated. The blood of the sin-offering was therefore smeared upon them (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>), and those who fled to the altar to save their lives laid hold of them (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; also my commentary on the passage).
