It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hollow with boards - Slabs, or planks, rather than boards.

Jewish as well as Christian authorities have supposed that, when it was fixed for use, it was filled up with earth or rough stones. If we connect this suggestion with the old rule regarding the altar of earth and the altar of stone given in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24-25</a>, the woodwork might in fact be regarded merely as the case of the altar on which the victims were actually burned. The shelf round the sides <a href="/exodus/27-5.htm">Exodus 27:5</a> was required as a stage for the priests to enable them to carry on their work conveniently on the top of the altar. Hence, it is said of Aaron that he came down from the altar <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a>. According to rabbinical tradition, there was a slope of earth at the south side banked up for the priest to ascend to the stage (compare <a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. staves &#8230; rings&#8212;Those rings were placed at the side through which the poles were inserted on occasions of removal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Not one entire piece of.wood, but consisting of four several sides, hollow within, for easiness and conveniency of carriage in their wilderness state. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hollow with boards shalt thou make it,.... The frame of it being made of boards of shittim wood, there was nothing within side but the grate, which was put within the square, down into the middle of it, and so was light of carriage; though the Targum of Jonathan, and other Jewish writers, represent this hollow as filled up with dust and earth, to answer to the altar of earth Moses was before bid to make; but this seems quite contrary to the present direction: the hollowness of the altar may denote the emptiness of Christ when he became a sacrifice: he emptied himself, as it were, when he became incarnate, of all his greatness, glory, and riches, and became mean and poor for the sake of his people, that they through his poverty might be made rich, <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>. <p>as it was showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it; or, "as he showed thee" (g), that is, God.

As nothing is said about a top to the altar, on which the victims might be placed, it is commonly assumed that, when the Tabernacle became stationary, the hollow case of the altar was filled up with earth. But it is strange that, if intended, this is not expressed. On the other hand, if the fire was kindled on the ground, within the altar, it is obvious that the wooden sides would quickly be destroyed. The directions here given are in fact entirely unrelated to those of <a href="/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a> f. When the character of P’s Tabernacle-legislation, as a whole, is considered, and account taken of the wide differences which separate it from the ceremonial legislation of JE, it can hardly be doubted that the true explanation of the present remarkable structure is that ‘it originated in the desire to construct a portable altar on the lines of the massive bronze altar of Solomon, which was itself a departure from the true Heb. tradition (<a href="/context/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you....">Exodus 20:24-26</a>)’ (Kennedy, p. 658). The bronze altar in Solomon’s temple was a gigantic structure, 20 cubits (30 ft.) long and broad, and 10 cubits (15 ft.) high (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>),—no doubt the work of Phoenician artists (cf. <a href="/context/1_kings/7-13.htm" title="And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre....">1 Kings 7:13-16</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/7-40.htm" title="And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins.

Zerubbabel’s altar, it may be added, was built of stone (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-46.htm" title="And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them.">1Ma 4:46</a>): the one erected by Judas in its place, in 165 b.c., was of unhewn stone, ‘according to the law’ of <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a> (<span class="ital">ib. v.</span> 47).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">9–19</span> (cf. <a href="/context/exodus/38-9.htm" title="And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:...">Exodus 38:9-20</a>.

These horns were projections at the corners of the altar, formed to imitate in all probability the horns of oxen, and in these the whole force of the altar was concentrated. The blood of the sin-offering was therefore smeared upon them (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>), and those who fled to the altar to save their lives laid hold of them (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; also my commentary on the passage).
