The reasons usually given for this name of the tabernacle are, either because the children of Israel gathered and met together here at certain times, or because here the Lord met with Moses, and his successors, as he had promised, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>, but neither of them will hold good; not the first, because the place where the candlestick was, and which Aaron and his sons are here said to order, was in the holy place, into which only the priests entered, and therefore could not be called the tabernacle of the congregation, from the people of Israel being gathered and assembling there; not the latter, because it was in the most holy place, where the Lord promised to meet with Moses, and commune with him, even from between the cherubim over the mercy seat there: indeed, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation the children of Israel assembled, and there the Lord met them, and so the whole might be called from thence, and there seems to be no other reason for it, <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a> and this place was <p>without the vail, which is before the testimony; that is, without the vail which divided between the holy and the most holy place, and which vail was before the ark, where the law or the testimony was put; for the candlestick was in that part of the tabernacle which was without the vail, or in the holy place: and here <p>Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the Lord; that is, they were to take care that the lamps which went out might be lighted; and that they be kept clear and burning, they were to trim and snuff them, for which they had proper instruments provided for them, <a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>. This points at the word of God, which shines as a light in a dark place, and is a lamp to the feet, and a light to the path, and to the constant application of Gospel ministers in preaching it, in order to enlighten men in all ages unto the end of the world: <p>it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations, on the behalf of the children of Israel; on whom it was incumbent to provide oil for the lamps, as long as the tabernacle and temple service lasted; and figured out either the maintenance of Gospel ministers by the churches, or the grace and gifts of the Spirit, with which they are furnished by the head of the church, often signified by oil in Scripture. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">the tent of meeting</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">’ôhel mô‘çd</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">the tent of appointed meeting</span> (cf. <a href="/job/30-23.htm" title="For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.">Job 30:23</a> ‘the house of <span class="ital">appointed meeting</span> for all living,’ of Sheol), the tent appointed by Jehovah as the place where He will ‘meet’ Moses (see in P <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>, <a href="/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-36.htm" title="And you shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with you: it shall be to you most holy.">Exodus 30:36</a>) and Israel (<a href="/context/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you....">Exodus 29:42-43</a>, <a href="/numbers/17-4.htm" title="And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Numbers 17:4</a>), and communicate His will to them, or (<span class="ital">OTJC.</span>2[205] 246) the ‘tent of tryst’ (i.e. of appointment to meet).

The pillars were therefore equidistant from one another, viz., 5 cubits apart.

And the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14-16</a>, that three pillars were to be made in front to carry the hangings on either side of the door, and four to carry the curtain which covered the entrance, may be easily shown to be correct, notwithstanding the fact that, as every drawing shows, four pillars would be required, and not three only, to carry 15 cubits of hangings, and five (not four) to carry a curtain 20 cubits broad, if the pillars were to be placed 5 cubits apart; for the corner pillars, as belonging to both sides, and the pillars which stood between the hangings and the curtain on either side, could only be reckoned as halves in connection with each side or each post; and in reckoning the number of pillars according to the method adopted in every other case, the pillar from which you start would not be reckoned at all. Now, if you count the pillars of the eastern side upon this principle (starting from a corner pillar, which is not reckoned, because it is the starting-point and is the last pillar of the side wall), you have 1, 2, 3, then 1, 2, 3, 4, and then again 1, 2, 3; that is to say, 3 pillars for each wing and 4 for the curtain, although the hangings of each wing would really be supported by 4 pillars, and the curtain in the middle by 5.) </body></html>
