The writer must thus, for the sake of symmetry, have reckoned the sides as having respectively 20 and 10 pillars each, when in reality they would have 21 and 11. ‘The S. side, reckoning from E. to W., has pillars nos. 1–21, of which no. 21, however, is reckoned as belonging to the W. side; the W. side has nos. 21–31 (i.e. 11), no. 31 being reckoned to the N. side; the N. side has nos. 31–51 (i.e. 21), no. 51 being reckoned to the E. side; the E. side has for the N. side of the entrance nos. 51–54, no. 54 being reckoned to the entrance: the entrance has nos. 54–58, no. 58 being reckoned to the S. side of the entrance; the S. side of the entrance has nos. 58–61, no. 61 being the same as no. 1 of the S. side’ (Di.; similarly Kennedy).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">20–21</span> (no parallel in 35–40).

There were many "vessels of the tabernacle" which have not hitherto been mentioned, as the great laver in the court (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-30.htm">Exodus 40:30</a>) with the basins for washing which must have belonged to it; the pins or pegs whereby the various curtains were extended and supported; and probably much sacrificial apparatus besides what is enumerated in ver. 3. All these were to be of bronze, the commonest metal of the time, but one very suitable for the various purposes, being, as the Egyptians manufactured it, of great hardness, yet exceedingly ductile and ready to take all shapes. Its usefulness and convenience caused it to retain its place, even in the gorgeous and "magnificent" temple of Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2, 7</a>), where it was employed for the two great pillars, Jachin and Boaz, for the great laver or "brazen sea," for the mailer layers upon wheels, for the pots, the shovels, the basins, the snuffers, the spoons, and many other sacred vessels (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-45</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13, 14</a>). Though "common," it was never reckoned "unclean," or less fitted for the service of the sanctuary than silver or gold. It had, however, its own proper place, an inferior place to that held by the more precious metals. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the pins thereof</span>. The "pins" of the tabernacle are undoubtedly the pegs or tent-pins, whereby the tent-cloth wherewith it was covered was extended and kept taut. There were also probably similar pegs or pins for cords used to keep the "pillars" (<a href="/exodus/26-37.htm">Exodus 26:37</a>) or tent-poles in place. <span class="cmt_word">The pins of the court</span> supported in the same way the pillars of the court (vers. 10-15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 27:20-21 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"As for the breadth of the court on the west side, (there shall be) curtains fifty cubits; their pillars twenty; and the breadth of the court towards the front, on the east side, fifty cubits." The front is divided in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14-16</a> into two &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, lit., shoulders, i.e., sides or side-pieces, each consisting of 15 cubits of hangings and three pillars with their sockets, and a doorway (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;), naturally in the middle, which was covered by a curtain (&#1502;&#1505;&#1498;) formed of the same material as the covering at the entrance to the dwelling, of 20 cubits in length, with four pillars and the same number of sockets. The pillars were therefore equidistant from one another, viz., 5 cubits apart. Their total number was 60 (not 56), which was the number required, at the distance mentioned, to surround a quadrangular space of 100 cubits long and 50 cubits broad.<p>(Note: Although any one may easily convince himself of the correctness of these numbers by drawing a figure, Knobel has revived Philo's erroneous statement about 56 pillars and the double reckoning of the pillars in the corner. And the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14-16</a>, that three pillars were to be made in front to carry the hangings on either side of the door, and four to carry the curtain which covered the entrance, may be easily shown to be correct, notwithstanding the fact that, as every drawing shows, four pillars would be required, and not three only, to carry 15 cubits of hangings, and five (not four) to carry a curtain 20 cubits broad, if the pillars were to be placed 5 cubits apart; for the corner pillars, as belonging to both sides, and the pillars which stood between the hangings and the curtain on either side, could only be reckoned as halves in connection with each side or each post; and in reckoning the number of pillars according to the method adopted in every other case, the pillar from which you start would not be reckoned at all. Now, if you count the pillars of the eastern side upon this principle (starting from a corner pillar, which is not reckoned, because it is the starting-point and is the last pillar of the side wall), you have 1, 2, 3, then 1, 2, 3, 4, and then again 1, 2, 3; that is to say, 3 pillars for each wing and 4 for the curtain, although the hangings of each wing would really be supported by 4 pillars, and the curtain in the middle by 5.) </body></html>
