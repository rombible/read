It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rice pillars - These, it should be observed, belonged to the entrance of the tent, not, in their architectural relation, to the entrance of the tabernacle.<p>Sockets of brass - Their bases (see <a href="/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19</a>) were of bronze (like the taches of the tentcloth, <a href="/exodus/26-11.htm">Exodus 26:11</a>), not of silver, to mark the inferiority of the tent to the tabernacle.<p>We are indebted to Mr. Fergusson for what may be regarded as a satisfactory reconstruction of the sanctuary in all its main particulars.

This altar was not typical of the altar of the heart; though indeed all the saints are priests, and every sacrifice of theirs should come from the heart, and particularly love, which is more than all burnt offerings; but the heart is not this altar of brass to bear the fire of divine wrath, which none can endure; nor does it sanctify the gift, it being itself impure: nor of the Lord's table, or the table on which the Lord's supper is set; that is a table, and not an altar, a feast, and not a sacrifice; is not greater than the gift, nor does it sanctify: nor of the cross or Christ, on which he died, bore the sins or his people, and sanctified them by his blood; but of Christ himself, who by his office as a priest, his human nature is the sacrifice, and his divine nature the altar; and he is that altar believers in him have a right to eat of, <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a> his divine nature is greater than the human, is the support of it, which sanctifies and gives it virtue as a sacrifice, and which makes the sacrifices of all his people acceptable to God. This altar of burnt offering is said to be made of "shittim wood", a wood incorruptible and durable; Christ, as God, is from everlasting to everlasting; as man, though he once died, he now lives for evermore, and never did or will see corruption; his priesthood is an unchangeable priesthood, and passes not from one to another, and particularly his sacrifice is of a continual virtue and efficacy: <p>five cubits long, and five cubits broad: the altar shall be square: as to the length and breadth of it, which were alike, two yards and a half each, according to the common notion of a cubit. The altars of the Heathens were made in imitation of this, they were square as this was. Pausanias makes mention of an altar of Diana, that was "square", sensibly rising up on high. And this figure may denote the perfection of Christ's sacrifice, and the permanency of it; though the altars in Solomon's temple, and in the visions of Ezekiel, are much larger, and which also were square, <a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>. Christ's sacrifice is large and extensive, making satisfaction for all his people, and for all their sins; and he is an altar large enough for all their sacrifices to be offered up to God with acceptance: <p>and the height thereof shall be three cubits; a proper height for a man to minister at; for as Aben Ezra observes, the height of a man is but four cubits ordinarily; so that a man serving at the altar would be a cubit, or half a yard more above it, and would have command of doing on it what he had to do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt make an <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> altar <i>of</i> shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof <i>shall be</i> three cubits.</span><p>(a) For the burnt offering.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">the altar</span>] <span class="ital">the</span> altar <span class="greekheb">κατ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἐξοχήν</span>, if not, in P’s view (see on <a href="/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it....">Exodus 30:1-10</a>), the only altar.

From the description of the tabernacle, or sacred tent in which worship was to be offered by the priests, it followed in natural sequence, that directions should be given concerning the court, or precinct, within which the tabernacle was to stand Ancient temples were almost universally surrounded by precincts, which the Greeks called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, whereto a sacred character attached; and this was particularly the case in Egypt, where the <span class="accented">temenos</span> seems to have been a regular adjunct to the temple (Wilkinson in Rawlinson's <span class="accented">Heradotus</span>, vol. 2. p. 202, 2nd edition). Among the chief  uses of such an open space, was the offering of victims on altars, as these could not be conveniently consumed elsewhere than in the open air, on account of the clouds of smoke and the fumes of the sacrifices. As in the description of the tabernacle, the furniture was first described, then the structure, so now the altar takes precedence of the court which was to contain it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make an altar</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">the</span> altar." God had already declared that he would have an altar made to him in the place where he should "record his name" (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>).

There can be no doubt that Jarchi is right in supposing that, whenever the tabernacle for a time became stationary, the hollow case of the altar was rifled up with earth, and that the victims were burnt upon this. <span class="cmt_word">Four-square</span>. Altars were commonly either square or round. An Assyrian triangular one was found by Mr. Layard at Nineveh; but even this had a round top.
