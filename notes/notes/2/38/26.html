The exegetical clause, half a shekel,” is probably a later addition to the text, inserted to clear the sense.<p><span class= "bld">For every one that went to be numbered.</span>—It is remarkable that the principle of compulsory payment towards the fabric of the sanctuary should have received a sanction at the very time when the greatest stress was laid upon the greater acceptableness of voluntary offerings.

Whatever may be thought of the expediency of levying church-rates, they are clearly defensible in principle, both from the standpoint of the Old Testament and of the New (<a href="/context/matthew/17-24.htm" title="And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Does not your master pay tribute?">Matthew 17:24-27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">From twenty years old and upward.</span>—See Note on <a href="/exodus/30-14.htm" title="Every one that passes among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.">Exodus 30:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.</span>—The identity of this number with that which is given in <a href="/numbers/1-46.htm" title="Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.">Numbers 1:46</a>, as arrived at “in the second year, on the first day of the second month” (<a href="/numbers/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,">Numbers 1:1</a>), is best explained by regarding both passages as having reference to the same transaction. The taking of the census occupied several months, during which the money was gradually collected, the sockets, &c., made, and the Tabernaclo set up. The registration was deferred, and took place on a single day, when Moses and Aaron went round the tribes, received the results from their hands, and entered them in a book. It appears from <a href="/numbers/1-47.htm" title="But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.">Numbers 1:47</a> that the Levites were not counted in the sum total, no atonement money being taken from them.

Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing.

It may seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be remembered that they were enriched first by the spoils of the Egyptians, and afterwards by those of the Amalekites. Besides, it is highly probable that during their sojourn they traded with the neighboring nations who bordered on the wilderness [Hewlett].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary,....
