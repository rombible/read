Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing, and count all but loss to win Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the estimate of the shekel that has here been adopted, the weight of the metals mentioned in this chapter would be nearly as follows, in avoirdupois weight:<p>Gold 1 ton 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 13 lbs.  Silver 4 tons 4 cwt. 2 qrs.  20 lbs.  Bronze 2 tons 19 cwt. 2 qrs. 11 lbs.  <p>The value of the gold, if pure, in our money would be 175,075 British pounds, 13 shillings, and of the silver, 38,034 British pounds, 15 shillings 10d. These quantities of the precious metals come quite within the limits of probability, if we consider the condition of the Israelites when they left Egypt (see <a href="/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a> note), and the object for which the collection was made. Many have remarked that the quantities collected for the tabernacle are insignificant when compared with the hoards of gold and silver collected in the East in recent times, as well as in ancient times. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. the silver of them that were numbered&#8212;603,550 men at half a shekel each would contribute 301,775 shekels; which at 2s. 4d. each, amounts to &pound;35,207 sterling. It may seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be remembered that they were enriched first by the spoils of the Egyptians, and afterwards by those of the Amalekites. Besides, it is highly probable that during their sojourn they traded with the neighboring nations who bordered on the wilderness [Hewlett].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels.
