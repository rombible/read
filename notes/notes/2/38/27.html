Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing.

It may seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be remembered that they were enriched first by the spoils of the Egyptians, and afterwards by those of the Amalekites. Besides, it is highly probable that during their sojourn they traded with the neighboring nations who bordered on the wilderness [Hewlett].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail,....

"These are the numbered things of the dwelling, of the dwelling of the testimony, that were numbered at the command of Moses, through the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest." &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean the numbering (equivalent to &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;   <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>, or &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a>), as Knobel supposes, but here as elsewhere, even in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-63.htm">Numbers 26:63-64</a>, it signifies "the numbered;" the only difference being, that in most cases it refers to persons, here to things, and that the reckoning consisted not merely in the counting and entering of the different things, but in ascertaining their weight and estimating their worth. Lyra has given the following correct rendering of this heading: "haec est summa numeri ponderis eorum, quae facta sunt in tabernaculo ex auro, argento et aere." It was apparently superfluous to enumerate the different articles again, as this had been repeatedly done before. The weight of the different metals, therefore, is all that is given. The "dwelling" is still further described as "the dwelling of the testimony," because the testimony, i.e., the decalogue written with the finger of God upon the tables of stone, was kept in the dwelling, and this testimony formed the base of the throne of Jehovah, and was the material pledge that Jehovah would cause His name, His manifested presence, to dwell there, and would thus show Himself to His people in grace and righteousness. "That which was numbered" is an explanatory apposition to the previous clause, "the numbering of the dwelling;" and the words &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;, which follow, are an accusative construed freely to indicate more particularly the mode of numbering (Ewald, 204 a), viz., "through the service," or "by means of the service of the Levites," not for their service. "By the hand of Ithamar:" who presided over the calculations which the Levites carried out under his superintendence.</body></html>
