All that share in God's mercies should join in thankful praises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of the passover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. This taught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitled them to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransom for our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission; without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, by faith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under the protection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantly depending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and our obligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Do we stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and to separate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vast importance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly to answer them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A foreigner - or sojourner: one who resides in a country, not having a permanent home, nor being attached to an Israelitish household. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. even the selfsame day&#8212;implying an exact and literal fulfilment of the predicted period.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Except he submit to circumcision, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/12-43.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:">Exodus 12:43</a></span>.
