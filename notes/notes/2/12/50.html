All that share in God's mercies should join in thankful praises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of the passover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. This taught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitled them to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransom for our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission; without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, by faith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under the protection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantly depending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and our obligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Do we stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and to separate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vast importance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly to answer them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In one house - i. e.

If the Passover was still to retain this signification, of course no foreigner could participate in it. This is the first regulation. But as it was by virtue of a divine call, and not through natural descent, that Israel had become the people of Jehovah, and as it was destined in that capacity to be a blessing to all nations, the attitude assumed towards foreigners was not to be an altogether repelling one. Hence the further directions in <a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44</a> : purchased servants, who had been politically incorporated as Israel's property, were to be entirely incorporated by circumcision, so as even to take part in the Passover. But settlers, and servants working for wages, were not to eat of it, for they stood in a purely external relation, which might be any day dissolved. &#1489;&#1468; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, lit., to eat at anything, to take part in the eating (<a href="/leviticus/22-11.htm">Leviticus 22:11</a>). The deeper ground fore this was, that in this meal Israel was to preserve and celebrate its unity and fellowship with Jehovah. This was the meaning of the regulations, which were repeated in <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-47.htm">Exodus 12:47</a> from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-4.htm">Exodus 12:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-9.htm">Exodus 12:9</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>, where they had been already explained. If, therefore, a foreigner living among the Israelites wished to keep the Passover, he was first of all to be spiritually incorporated into the nation of Jehovah by circumcision (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>). &#1508;&#1505; &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;: "And he has made (i.e., made ready) a passover to Jehovah, let every male be circumcised to him (i.e., he himself, and the male members of his house), and then he may draw near (sc., to Jehovah) to keep it." The first &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; denotes the wish or intention to do it, the second, the actual execution of the wish. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, are all indicative of non-Israelites. &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512; was applied quite generally to any foreigner springing from another nation; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512; was a foreigner living for a shorter or longer time in the midst of the Israelites; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, lit., a dweller, settler, was one who settled permanently among the Israelites, without being received into their religious fellowship; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; was the non-Israelite, who worked for an Israelite for wages. </body></html>
