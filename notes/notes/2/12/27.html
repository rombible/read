Their safety was owing to the blood of sprinkling. If they put themselves from under the protection of that, it was at their peril. They must stay within, to wait for the salvation of the Lord; it is good to do so. In after-times they should carefully teach their children the meaning of this service. It is good for children to ask about the things of God; they that ask for the way will find it. The keeping of this solemnity every year was, 1. To look backward, that they might remember what great things God had done for them and their fathers. Old mercies, to ourselves, or to our fathers, must not be forgotten, that God may be praised, and our faith in him encouraged. 2. It was designed to look forward, as an earnest of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God in the fulness of time.

The most formal and exact designation of the festival is thus given: but "the Passover" may mean either the act of God's mercy in sparing the Israelites, or the lamb which is offered in sacrifice: more probably the latter, as in <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21</a>. This gives a clear sense to the expression "to Yahweh;" the Passover lamb was a sacrifice offered to Yahweh by His ordinance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27, 28. the people bowed the head, and worshipped&#8212;All the preceding directions were communicated through the elders, and the Israelites, being deeply solemnized by the influence of past and prospective events, gave prompt and faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The passover was both a sacrifice, as it was offered to God, as it appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/23-18.htm" title="You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.">Exodus 23:18</a> 34:25 <a href="/numbers/9-7.htm" title="And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?">Numbers 9:7</a>,13 Deu 16:2,5</span>; and because there was in it the shedding and sprinkling of blood, wherein the essence of a sacrifice consists, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm" title="And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.">2 Chronicles 30:16</a> 35:11,13</span>; and also a sacrament, as it was received and eaten by men.

This lamb is a sacrifice, both eucharistical, or by way of thanksgiving for their safety, when the firstborn of the Egyptians were slain, and for their deliverance out of Egypt; and also propitiatory, the blood of this lamb being a propitiation or atonement for all within the house where it was sprinkled, as before observed from Aben Ezra; and typical of the atoning sacrifice of Christ our passover, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a> and this was commanded by the Lord, and approved of and accepted by him, and therefore called his sacrifice as well as passover, for the following reason: <p>who passed over the houses of the children of Israel, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses; their families, not suffering the destroying angel to enter into them, which was a very distinguishing mercy, and worthy of remembrance. Now in this they were to instruct their children in successive generations, that the memory of it might be kept up, and a sense of the goodness of God continued, and his name glorified. Maimonides (y) says,"it is a command to make this known to children, even though they do not ask it, as it is said, "and thou shall show thy son", <a href="/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>. According to the son's knowledge, his father teaches him; how if he is a little one or foolish? he says to him, my son, all of us were servants, as this handmaid, or this servant, in Egypt; and on this night the holy blessed God redeemed us, and brought us into liberty: and if the son is grown up, and a wise man, he makes known to him what happened to us in Egypt, and the wonders which were done for us by the hand of Moses our master, all according to the capacity of his son; and it is necessary to make a repetition on this night, that the children may see, and ask, and say, how different is this night from all other nights! until he replies and says to them, so and so it happened, and thus and thus it was:" <p>and the people bowed the head and worshipped; signifying the deep sense they had of the mercy shown them, their thankfulness for it, and their readiness to observe the ordinance now instituted. <p>(y) Hilchot Chametz Umetzah, c. 7. sect. 2, 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That ye shall say, It <i>is</i> the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.

It has been denied that the Paschal lamb was, in the true sense of the word, a sacrifice (Carpzov and others). But this passage alone is decisive on the question, and proves that it was. Moreover, it was offered in the holy place (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5, 6</a> ); the blood of it was sprinkled upon the altar, and the fat was burnt (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">2 Chronicles 35:11</a>).
