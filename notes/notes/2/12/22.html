The Pesh. <span class="ital">zupha</span> also means the same plant (Löw, <span class="ital">Aram. Pflanzennamen</span>, No. 93)1[129]. Post (<span class="ital">DB.</span> s.v.) thinks that the particular species meant is the <span class="ital">Origanum Maru</span>, Linn. This grows in clefts of rocks, in chinks of old walls, and on the terrace walls throughout Palestine: it has straight, slender, leafy stalks, with small heads, several of the stalks growing from one root, so that a bunch or wisp suitable for sprinkling a liquid with could readily be broken off. Tristram (<span class="ital">NHB.</span> 456 ff.) argues in favour of the Caper (<span class="ital">Capparis spinosa</span>), a bright green creeper, which climbs out of fissures of rocks in the Sinaitic valleys, and hangs in abundance from the walls of Jerusalem, and the stalks of which, bearing from three to five blossoms each, would likewise be suitable for the same purpose; but the former interpretation has very strong support in ancient tradition, and there appears to be no sufficient reason for deserting it1[130].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[129] In the Talm.

One, that it was a species of marjoram (<span class="accented">Origanum Aegyptiacum</span>, <span class="accented">or O.

(Stanley, <span class="accented">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 21.) It is in favour of this latter identification, that the modern Arabic name for the caper plant is <span class="accented">asaf</span> or <span class="accented">asuf</span>, which excellently represents the Hebrew <span class="accented">ezob</span>, the word uniformly rendered in our version by "hyssop" <span class="cmt_word">The blood that is in the basin</span>.
