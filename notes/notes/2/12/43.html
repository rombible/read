All that share in God's mercies should join in thankful praises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of the passover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. This taught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitled them to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransom for our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission; without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, by faith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under the protection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantly depending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and our obligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Do we stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and to separate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vast importance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly to answer them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said - From this verse to <a href="/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a> are instructions regarding the Passover.

The position of these verses is curious. We should have expected them to have followed immediately on ver. 20, or else to have been reserved for the further consideration of the subject in ch. 23. It is suggested, in order to account for their place, that they formed the matter of a special revelation made to Moses at Succoth. They comprise three main points: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The absolute exclusion of all uncircumcised persons from participation in the passover rite; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The extension of the rite (implied in ver. 19) to all full proselytes; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The injunction that not a bone of the lamb should be broken.

Compare ver. 48. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt. - The starting-point was Ramses, from which they proceeded to Succoth (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>), thence to Etham at the end of the desert (<a href="/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20</a>), and from that by a curve to Hachiroth, opposite to the Red Sea, from which point they passed through the sea (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>, <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>.). Now, if we take these words simply as they stand, Israel touched the border of the desert of Arabia by the second day, and on the third day reached the plain of Suez and the Red Sea. But they could not possibly have gone so far, if Ramses stood upon the site of the modern Belbeis. For though the distance from Belbeis to Suez by the direct road past "Rejm el Khail is only a little more than 15 geographical miles, and a caravan with camels could make the journey in two days, this would be quite impossible for a whole nation travelling with wives, children, cattle, and baggage. Such a procession could never have reached Etham, on the border of the desert, on their second day's march, and then on the third day, by a circuitous course "of about a day's march in extent," have arrived at the plain of Suez between Ajiruud and the sea. This is admitted by Kurtz, who therefore follows v. Raumer in making a distinction between a stage and a day's journey, on the ground that &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; signifies the station or place of encampment, and not a day's journey. But the word neither means station nor place of encampment. It is derived from &#1504;&#1505;&#1506; to tear out (sc., the pegs of the tent), hence to take down the tent; and denotes removal from the place of encampment, and the subsequent march (cf. <a href="/numbers/33-1.htm">Numbers 33:1</a>). Such a march might indeed embrace more than a day's journey; but whenever the Israelites travelled more than a day before pitching their tents, it is expressly mentioned (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-8.htm">Numbers 33:8</a>, with <a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). These passages show very clearly that the stages from Ramses to Succoth, thence to Etham, and then again to Hachiroth, were a day's march each. The only question is, whether they only rested for one night at each of these places. The circumstances under which the Israelites took their departure favour the supposition, that they would get out of the Egyptian territory as quickly as possible, and rest no longer than was absolutely necessary; but the gathering of the whole nation, which was not collected together in one spot, as in a camp, at the time of their departure, and still more the confusion, and interruptions of various kinds, that would inevitably attend the migration of a whole nation, render it probable that they rested longer than one night at each of the places named. This would explain most simply, how Pharaoh was able to overtake them with his army at Hachiroth. But whatever our views on this point may be, so much is certain, that Israel could not have reached the plain of Suez in a three days' march from Belbeis with the circuitous route by Etham, and therefore that their starting-point cannot have been Belbeis, but must have been in the neighbourhood of Heropolis; and there are other things that favour this conclusion. There is, first, the circumstance that Pharaoh sent for Moses the very same night after the slaying of the first-born, and told him to depart. Now the Pentateuch does not mention Pharaoh's place of abode, but according to <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a> it was Zoan, i.e., Tanis, on the eastern bank of the Tanitic arm of the Nile. Abu Keishib (or Heroopolis) is only half as far from Tanis as Belbeis, and the possibility of Moses appearing before the king and returning to his own people between midnight and the morning is perfectly conceivable, on the supposition that Moses was not in Heroopolis itself, but was staying in a more northerly place, with the expectation that Pharaoh would send a message to him, or send for him, after the final blow. Again, Abu Keishib was on the way to Gaza; so that the Israelites might take the road towards the country of the Philistines, and then, as this was not the road they were to take, turn round at God's command by the road to the desert (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17-18</a>). Lastly, Etham could be reached in two days from the starting-point named.<p>(Note: The different views as to the march of the Israelites from Raemses to their passage through the sea, are to be found in the Studien und Kritiken, 1850, pp. 328ff., and in Kurtz, ii. pp. 361ff.)<p>On the situation of Succoth and Etham, see <a href="/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20</a>.<p>The Israelites departed, "about 600,000 on foot that were men." &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>, the infantry of an army) is added, because they went out as an army (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>), and none are numbered but those who could bear arms, from 20 years old and upwards; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; because of &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;, "beside the little ones," which follows. &#1496;&#1507; is used here in its broader sense, as in <a href="/genesis/47-12.htm">Genesis 47:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>, and applies to the entire family, including the wife and children, who did not travel on foot, but on beasts of burden and in carriages (<a href="/genesis/31-17.htm">Genesis 31:17</a>). The number given is an approximative one. The numbering at Sinai gave 603,550 males of 20 years old and upwards (<a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>), and 22,000 male Levites of a month old and upwards (<a href="/numbers/3-39.htm">Numbers 3:39</a>). Now if we add the wives and children, the total number of the people may have been about two million souls. The multiplication of the seventy souls, who went down with Jacob to Egypt, into this vast multitude, is not so disproportionate to the 430 years of their sojourn there, as to render it at all necessary to assume that the numbers given included not only the descendants of the seventy souls who went down with Jacob, but also those of "several thousand man-servants and maid-servants" who accompanied them. For, apart from the fact, that we are not warranted in concluding, that because Abraham had 318 fighting servants, the twelve sons of Jacob had several thousand, and took them with them into Egypt; even if the servants had been received into the religious fellowship of Israel by circumcision, they cannot have reckoned among the 600,000 who went out, for the simple reason that they are not included in the seventy souls who went down to Egypt; and in <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a> the number of those who came out is placed in unmistakeable connection with the number of those who went in. If we deduct from the 70 souls the patriarch Jacob, his 12 sons, Dinah, Asher's daughter Zerah, the three sons of Levi, the four grandsons of Judah and Benjamin, and those grandsons of Jacob who probably died without leaving any male posterity, since their descendants are not mentioned among the families of Israel, there remain 41 grandsons of Jacob who founded families, in addition to the Levites. Now, if we follow <a href="/1_chronicles/7-20.htm">1 Chronicles 7:20</a>., where ten or eleven generations are mentioned between Ephraim and Joshua, and reckon 40 years as a generation, the tenth generation of the 41 grandsons of Jacob would be born about the year 400 of the sojourn in Egypt, and therefore be over 20 years of age at the time of the exodus. Let us assume, that on an average there were three sons and three daughters to every married couple in the first six of these generations, two sons and two daughters in the last four, and we shall find, that in the tenth generation there would be 478,224 sons about the 400th year of the sojourn in Egypt, who would therefore be above 20 years of age at the time of the exodus, whilst 125,326 men of the ninth generation would be still living, so that there would be 478,224 + 125,326, or 603,550 men coming out of Egypt, who were more than 20 years old. But though our calculation is based upon no more than the ordinary number of births, a special blessing from God is to be discerned not only in this fruitfulness, which we suppose to have been uninterrupted, but still more in the fact, that the presumed number of children continued alive, and begot the same number of children themselves; and the divine grace was peculiarly manifest in the fact, that neither pestilence nor other evils, nor even the measures adopted by the Pharaohs for the suppression of Israel, could diminish their numbers or restrain their increase. If the question be asked, how the land of Goshen could sustain so large a number, especially as the Israelites were not the only inhabitants, but lived along with Egyptians there, it is a sufficient reply, that according to both ancient and modern testimony (cf. Robinson, Pal. i. p. 78), this is the most fertile province in all Egypt, and that we are not so well acquainted with the extent of the territory inhabited by the Israelites, as to be able to estimate the amount of its produce.</body></html>
