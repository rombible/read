He occupied a position similar to that of Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>), holding a priesthood of the most primitive character, probably as patriarch of his tribe, its head by right of primogeniture.

Jethro not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but in all the goodness done to Israel. Standers-by were more affected with the favours God had showed to Israel, than many were who received them. Jethro gave the glory to Israel's God. Whatever we have the joy of, God must have the praise. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Mutual friendship is sanctified by joint worship. It is very good for relations and friends to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, as those that meet in Christ. This was a temperate feast; they did eat bread, manna. Jethro must see and taste that bread from heaven, and though a gentile, is welcome: the gentiles are welcomed to Christ the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A burnt offering and sacrifices - This verse clearly shows that Jethro was recognized as a priest of the true God, and is of great importance in its bearings upon the relation between the Israelites and their congeners, and upon the state of religion among the descendants of Abraham. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Jethro &#8230; took a burnt offering&#8212;This friendly interview was terminated by a solemn religious service&#8212;the burnt offerings were consumed on the altar, and the sacrifices were peace offerings, used in a feast of joy and gratitude at which Jethro, as priest of the true God, seems to have presided, and to which the chiefs of Israel were invited.

The burnt offering, which was either of the flock or of the herd, was wholly consumed by fire, from whence it had its name; the peace offering for thanksgiving, which seemed to be meant by the sacrifices here, the flesh of them were to be eaten, <a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a> and now a feast was kept, as the latter part of the verse shows: whether Jethro brought cattle along with him for such a purpose, and so "gave" (p) or "offered" them for a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; as the word for took may be rendered, one and the same word signifying both to give and take, see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>, compared with <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a> or whether, with the leave of Moses and the children of Israel, he took them out of their flocks and herds, it matters not, since this is only observed to show Jethro's devotion to God, and the grateful sense he had of the divine goodness to Israel; and since he was a priest of Midian, as he is generally said to be, and a priest of the most high God, as Melchizedek was, he might offer sacrifices; for it does not appear that he delivered them to others to be offered, or that these were slain by Aaron; for, though he is after mentioned, yet not as a sacrificer, but as a guest; and perhaps this might be before he and his sons were separated to the priest's office, or, at least, before they had entered upon it; nor is this mention of a burnt offering and sacrifices any proof of Jethro's meeting Moses after the giving of the law, since, before that, sacrifices were in use, and Jethro being a grandchild of Abraham, might have learnt the use of them from him: <p>and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses's father in law, before God; the tents of Moses being on the east side of the tabernacle, as Aben Ezra says, in which was the mercy seat and cherubim, between which the divine Majesty was; but there is no need to suppose that the tabernacle was now built, for this tent of Moses might be placed before or near the pillar of cloud in which Jehovah was; or the sense may only be, that they ate their food in the presence of God, in the fear of the Lord, with gladness and singleness of heart, as good men do; and especially as this was an eucharistic sacrifice unto God they partook of, Aaron and the elders came out of a civil respect to Jethro, to take a meal with him, as well as to join with him in a religious action: the bread they ate was, no doubt, the manna, which Jethro, though a Midianite, yet a descendant of Abraham, and a good man, partook of, and is put for the whole repast, the flesh of the sacrifices and what else were eaten: no mention is made of Moses, nor was there any need of it, as Aben Ezra observes, it being his tent in which they were: the Targum of Jonathan adds,"Moses stood and ministered before them;''and so says Jarchi;

Moses, Aaron, and the elders, partook of the sacrificial meal, regarding the whole rite as one legitimately performed by a duly qualified person, and so as one in which they could properly participate. Jethro, like Melchisedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>), was recognised as a priest of the true God, though it would seem that the Midianites generally were, a generation later, idolaters (<a href="/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To eat bread...  before God</span>.

Jethro rejoiced at this, and broke out in praise to Jehovah, declaring that Jehovah was greater than all gods, i.e., that He had shown Himself to be exalted above all gods, for God is great in the eyes of men only when He makes known His greatness through the display of His omnipotence. He then gave a practical expression to his praise by a burnt-offering and slain-offering, which he presented to God. The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a> is only an emphatic repetition of the first, and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is not dependent upon &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but upon &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; nopu tub, or upon &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; understood, which is to be supplied in thought after the second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: "That He has proved Himself great by the affair in which they (the Egyptians) dealt proudly against them (the Israelites)." Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-10.htm">Nehemiah 9:10</a>, from which it is evident, that to refer these words to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea as a punishment for their attempt to destroy the Israelites in the water (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) is too contracted an interpretation; and that they rather relate to all the measures adopted by the Egyptians for the oppression and detention of the Israelites, and signify that Jehovah had shown Himself great above all gods by all the plagues inflicted upon Egypt down to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea. </body></html>
