Having been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is a further type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judge among them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they were with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. This business Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great care and kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his cause before him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethro thought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would make the administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may be over-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we may neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor task ourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan. Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive to make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the persons admitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, that understood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns or clamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety and religion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, though they could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will best fortify a man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despise this advice. Those are not wise, who think themselves too wise to be counselled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the morning unto the evening - It may be assumed as at least probable that numerous cases of difficulty arose out of the division of the spoil of the Amalekites <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm">Exodus 17:13</a>, and causes would have accumulated during the journey from Elim. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-26. on the morrow &#8230; Moses sat to judge the people, &c.&#8212;We are here presented with a specimen of his daily morning occupations; and among the multifarious duties his divine legation imposed, it must be considered only a small portion of his official employments.

But the context makes it abundantly clear that what Jethro really blames, is Moses sitting alone and judging the whole people single-handed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jethro announced his arrival to Moses ("he said," sc., through a messenger), he received his father-in-law with the honour due to his rank; and when he had conducted him to his tent, he related to him all the leading events connected with the departure from Egypt, and all the troubles they had met with on the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them out of them all. Jethro rejoiced at this, and broke out in praise to Jehovah, declaring that Jehovah was greater than all gods, i.e., that He had shown Himself to be exalted above all gods, for God is great in the eyes of men only when He makes known His greatness through the display of His omnipotence. He then gave a practical expression to his praise by a burnt-offering and slain-offering, which he presented to God. The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a> is only an emphatic repetition of the first, and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is not dependent upon &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but upon &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; nopu tub, or upon &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; understood, which is to be supplied in thought after the second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: "That He has proved Himself great by the affair in which they (the Egyptians) dealt proudly against them (the Israelites)." Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-10.htm">Nehemiah 9:10</a>, from which it is evident, that to refer these words to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea as a punishment for their attempt to destroy the Israelites in the water (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) is too contracted an interpretation; and that they rather relate to all the measures adopted by the Egyptians for the oppression and detention of the Israelites, and signify that Jehovah had shown Himself great above all gods by all the plagues inflicted upon Egypt down to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea. </body></html>
