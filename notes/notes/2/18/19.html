But he appointed judges in the several tribes and families, which should try causes between man and man, and determine them, which would be done with less noise and more despatch than in the general assembly. Those whose gifts and stations are most eminent may yet be greatly furthered in their work by the assistance of those that are every way their inferiors. This is Jethro’s advice; but he adds two qualifications to his counsel. First, That great care should be taken in the choice of the persons who should be admitted into this trust; it was requisite that they should be men of the best character. 1st, For judgment and resolution, <span class="ital">able men — </span>Men of good sense, that understood business; and bold men, that would not be daunted by frowns or clamours. 2d, For piety, <span class="ital">such as fear God — </span>Who believe there is a God above them, that his eye is upon them, and that they are accountable to him, and who therefore stand in awe of his judgment.

Secondly, That he should attend to God’s direction in the case, verse<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">23.</span> <span class="ital">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so </span>— Jethro knew that Moses had a better counsellor than he was, and to his counsel he refers him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:13-27 Here is the great zeal and the toil of Moses as a magistrate. Having been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is a further type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judge among them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they were with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. This business Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great care and kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his cause before him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethro thought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would make the administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may be over-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we may neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor task ourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan. Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive to make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the persons admitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, that understood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns or clamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety and religion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, though they could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will best fortify a man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despise this advice.

All this relates to what Moses has done already: he is, as he has already done, to bring important cases to God, and to advise the people of the general laws which follow from their determination (as, for instance, from a particular case of damage, there might result a decision which would give such a law as <a href="/context/exodus/21-33.htm" title="And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;...">Exodus 21:33-34</a>), and so make known to them how they are to act when such cases arise.

The separation of the legislative and judicial functions was well known in Egypt, where the kings alone made new laws (Herod. 2:109, 136, 177, etc.), but causes were ordinarily determined by a body of judges. <span class="cmt_word">Bring the causes unto God</span>. In difficult cases, Moses actually laid the cause before God, and obtained directions from God as to the manner in which he was to decide it. See <a href="/numbers/27-5.htm">Numbers 27:5-11</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The next day Jethro saw how Moses was occupied from morning till evening in judging the people, who brought all their disputes to him, that he might settle them according to the statutes of God. &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;: as in <a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>. The people came to Moses "to seek or inquire of God" (<a href="/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>), i.e., to ask for a decision from God: in most cases, this means to inquire through an oracle; here it signifies to desire a divine decision as to questions in dispute. By judging or deciding the cases brought before him, Moses made known to the people the ordinances and laws of God. For every decision was based upon some law, which, like all true justice here on earth, emanated first of all from God. This is the meaning of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>, and not, as Knobel supposes, that Moses made use of the questions in dispute, at the time they were decided, as good opportunities for giving laws to the people. Jethro condemned this plan (<a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>.) as exhausting, wearing out (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; lit., to fade away, <a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>), both for Moses and the people: for the latter, inasmuch as they not only got wearied out through long waiting, but, judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>, very often began to take the law into their own hands on account of the delay in the judicial decision, and so undermined the well-being of the community at large; and for Moses, inasmuch as the work was necessarily too great for him, and he could not continue for any length of time to sustain such a burden alone (<a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). The obsolete form of the inf. const. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1493; is only used here, but is not without analogies in the Pentateuch. Jethro advised him (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>.) to appoint judged from the people for all the smaller matters in dispute, so that in future only the more difficult cases, which really needed a superior or divine decision, would be brought to him that he might lay them before God. "I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee (i.e., help thee to carry out this advice): Be thou to the people &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, towards God," i.e., lay their affairs before God, take the place of God in matters of judgment, or, as Luther expresses it, "take charge of the people before God." To this end, in the first place, he was to instruct the people in the commandments of God, and their own walk and conduct (&#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; with a double accusative, to enlighten, instruct; &#1513;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; the walk, the whole behaviour; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; particular actions); secondly, he was to select able men (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; men of moral strength, <a href="/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>) as judges, men who were God-fearing, sincere, and unselfish (gain-hating), and appoint them to administer justice to the people, by deciding the simpler matters themselves, and only referring the more difficult questions to him, and so to lighten his own duties by sharing the burden with these judges. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1492;&#1511;&#1500; (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a>) "make light of (that which lies) upon thee." If he would do this, and God would command him, he would be able to stand, and the people would come to their place, i.e., to Canaan, in good condition (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;). The apodosis cannot begin with &#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, "then God will establish thee," for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; never has this meaning; but the idea is this, "if God should preside over the execution of the plan proposed." </body></html>
