This is the third time he is so called in the chapter already, and many more times besides after in it; the reason of which seems to be, either to distinguish him from another of the same name, or to do him honour, that he should be in such a relation to so great and distinguished a man as Moses now was: <p>came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness; not with his own sons and wife, but with the sons and wife of Moses; Zipporah and her sons, as before related; with those he came into the wilderness of Arabia, where Moses now was, and which was not at a great distance from Midian, since about the same spot Moses, when he dwelt there, had, and fed the flock of his father-in-law, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>, that part of the land of Midian where Jethro lived lay somewhere eastward of Mount Sinai, and was probably situated where Sharme now stands; which, according to Dr. Pocock (i), is about a day and a half's journey from Mount Sinai, from whence the monks of Mount Sinai are chiefly supplied with fish (k): it follows: where he encamped at the mount of God: at Horeb, where the Lord had appeared to Moses; and so the Targum of Jonathan adds,"where the glory of the Lord was revealed to Moses at the beginning;''and where, afterwards, the Lord, appeared again, and gave the law, and therefore is called the Mount of God; the one as well as the other being past when Moses wrote this book, and called the mountain by this name: it is matter of question at what time Jethro came hither, whether before or after the giving of the law: it seems, by the order in which this story is here placed, as if it was immediately after the battle with Amalek; and Saadiah Gaon is of opinion it was before the giving of the law; and one would think it most reasonable and natural that Jethro would take the first opportunity of visiting Moses, and that Moses would not long defer sending for his wife and children: but Aben Ezra thinks he did not come till the second year after the tabernacle was set up, since, in the context, mention is made of burnt offerings and sacrifices, and no account is given of a new altar built by Moses; and besides, he says, "I do make them know the statutes of God and his laws", <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a>, and it is certain from hence, that the children of Israel were removed from Rephidim, and were now encamped at the mount of God, at Horeb; but whether they had got to the other side of the mount of Sinai as yet is not so clear; though it looks as if what Moses did, by the advice of Jethro, was after the law was given on Sinai, see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> so that, upon the whole, it seems as if this account, according to the order of time, should be placed after <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-28.htm">Numbers 10:28</a>, or, as Dr. Lightfoot (l) thinks, between the tenth and eleventh verses of that chapter, and is put here to show that though Midian was near Amalek, as he observes, yet Jethro was exempt from the curse and destruction threatened to that, see <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>. <p>(i) Travels, p. 137.

War to the Lord from generation to generation!" There is nothing said about sacrifices being offered upon this altar. It has been conjectured, therefore, that as a place of worship and thank-offering, the altar with its expressive name was merely to serve as a memorial to posterity of the gracious help of the Lord, and that the words which were spoken by Moses were to serve as a watchword for Israel, keeping this act of God in lively remembrance among the people in all succeeding generations. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>) merely introduces the words as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>, etc. The expression &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505; &#1497;&#1491; is obscure, chiefly on account of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;. In the ancient versions (with the exception of the Septuagint, in which &#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1509; is treated as one word, and rendered &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; is taken to be equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;   (<a href="/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>; <a href="/job/26-9.htm">Job 26:9</a>) for &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, and the clause is rendered "the hand upon the throne of the Lord." But whilst some understand the laying of the hand (sc., of God) upon the throne to be expressive of the attitude of swearing, others regard the hand as symbolical of power. There are others again, like Clericus, who suppose the hand to denote the hand laid by the Amalekites upon the throne of the Lord, i.e., on Israel. But if &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; signifies throng or adytum arcanum, the words can hardly be understood in any other sense than "the hand lifted up to the throne of Jehovah in heaven, war to the Lord," etc.; and thus understood, they can only contain an admonition to Israel to follow the example of Moses, and wage war against Amalek with the hands lifted up to the throne of Jehovah. Modern expositors, however, for the most part regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; as a corruption of &#1504;&#1505;, "the hand on the banner of the Lord." But even admitting this, though many objections may be offered to its correctness, we must not understand by "the banner of Jehovah" the staff of Moses, but only the altar with the name Jehovah-nissi, as the symbol or memorial of the victorious help afforded by God in the battle with the Amalekites. </body></html>
