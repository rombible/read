And of these the first is that of respecting their life. The security of life is the primary object of government; and it has been well said that men originally coalesced into States with a view to self-preservation (Arist., <span class= "ital">Pol. i.</span> 1). All written codes forbid murder; and in communities which are without written codes an unwritten law condemns it. When God “set a mark upon Cain” (<a href="/genesis/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.">Genesis 4:15</a>), He marked thereby His abhorrence of the murderer. The “seven precepts of Noah” included one which distinctly forbade the taking of human life (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>). In all countries and among all peoples, a natural instinct or an unwritten tradition placed murder among the worst of crimes, and made its penalty death. The Mosaic legislation on the point was differenced from others principally by the care it took to distinguish between actual murder, manslaughter (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm" title="And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.">Exodus 21:13</a>), death by misadventure (<a href="/numbers/35-23.htm" title="Or with any stone, with which a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it on him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:">Numbers 35:23</a>), and justifiable homicide (<a href="/exodus/22-2.htm" title="If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.">Exodus 22:2</a>). Before, however, it made these distinctions, the great principle of the sanctity of human life required to be broadly laid down; and so the law was given in the widest possible terms—“Thou shalt not kill.” Exceptions were reserved till later.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/20-13.htm" title="You shall not kill.">Exodus 20:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not kill — </span>Thou shalt not do any thing hurtful to the health or life of thy own body, or any other’s. This doth not forbid our necessary defence, or the magistrates putting offenders to death; but it forbids all malice and hatred to any, for <span class="ital">he that hateth his brother is a murderer, </span>and all revenge arising therefrom; likewise anger, and hurt said or done, or aimed to be done, in a passion; of this our Saviour expounds this commandment, <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:12-17 The laws of the SECOND table, that is, the last six of the ten commandments, state our duty to ourselves and to one another, and explain the great commandment, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, Lu 10:27. Godliness and honesty must go together. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations. Honour thy father and thy mother, includes esteem of them, shown in our conduct; obedience to their lawful commands; come when they call you, go where they send you, do what they bid you, refrain from what they forbid you; and this, as children, cheerfully, and from a principle of love. Also submission to their counsels and corrections. Endeavouring, in every thing, to comfort parents, and to make their old age easy; maintaining them if they need support, which our Saviour makes to be particularly intended in this commandment, Mt 15:4-6. Careful observers have noted a peculiar blessing in temporal things on obedient, and the reverse on disobedient children. The sixth commandment requires that we regard the life and the safety of others as we do our own. Magistrates and their officers, and witnesses testifying the truth, do not break this command. Self-defence is lawful; but much which is not deemed murder by the laws of man, is such before God. Furious passions, stirred up by anger or by drunkenness, are no excuse: more guilty is murder in duels, which is a horrible effect of a haughty, revengeful spirit. All fighting, whether for wages, for renown, or out of anger and malice, breaks this command, and the bloodshed therein is murder. To tempt men to vice and crimes which shorten life, may be included. Misconduct, such as may break the heart, or shorten the lives of parents, wives, or other relatives, is a breach of this command. This command forbids all envy, malice, hatred, or anger, all provoking or insulting language. The destruction of our own lives is here forbidden. This commandment requires a spirit of kindness, longsuffering, and forgiveness. The seventh commandment concerns chastity. We should be as much afraid of that which defiles the body, as of that which destroys it. Whatever tends to pollute the imagination, or to raise the passions, falls under this law, as impure pictures, books, conversation, or any other like matters. The eighth commandment is the law of love as it respects the property of others. The portion of worldly things allotted us, as far as it is obtained in an honest way, is the bread which God hath given us; for that we ought to be thankful, to be contented with it, and, in the use of lawful means, to trust Providence for the future. Imposing upon the ignorance, easiness, or necessity of others, and many other things, break God's law, though scarcely blamed in society. Plunderers of kingdoms though above human justice, will be included in this sentence. Defrauding the public, contracting debts without prospect of paying them, or evading payment of just debts, extravagance, all living upon charity when not needful, all squeezing the poor in their wages; these, and such things, break this command; which requires industry, frugality, and content, and to do to others, about worldly property, as we would they should do to us. The ninth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's good name. This forbids speaking falsely on any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising or designing to deceive our neighbour. Speaking unjustly against our neighbour, to hurt his reputation. Bearing false witness against him, or in common conversation slandering, backbiting, and tale-bearing; making what is done amiss, worse than it is, and in any way endeavouring to raise our reputation upon the ruin of our neighbour's. How much this command is every day broken among persons of all ranks! The tenth commandment strikes at the root; Thou shalt not covet. The others forbid all desire of doing what will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all wrong desire of having what will gratify ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-32</a> is the best comment on these two verses.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Remember the sabbath day&#8212;implying it was already known, and recognized as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments [Ex 20:3-11] comprise our duties to God&#8212;the other six [Ex 20:12-17] our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach to the government of the heart as well as the lip (Mt 5:17). "If a man do them he shall live in them" [Le 18:5; Ne 9:29]. But, ah! what an if for frail and fallen man. Whoever rests his hope upon the law stands debtor to it all; and in this view every one would be without hope were not "the Lord our Righteousness" [Jer 23:6; 33:16] (Joh 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit any man or woman, without authority, and without just cause; which exception must necessarily be understood, because many other scriptures command the magistrate to kill great offenders. And this prohibition being delivered by God, who made, and searcheth, and commands men’s hearts, must be extended not only to the external act of killing, but to all motions of the heart or tongue which tend that way, as anger, hatred, envy, malice, strife, blows, and the challenges of duelists; which is clearly manifest by comparing this with other scriptures, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21</a> <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1Jo 3:15</a></span>, &c.

Not meaning any sort of creatures, for there are some to be killed for the food and nourishment of men, and others for their safety and preservation; but rational creatures, men, women, and children, any of the human species, of every age, sex, condition, or nation; no man has a right to take away his own life, or the life of another; by this law is forbidden suicide, or self-murder, parricide or murder of parents, homicide or the murder of man; yet killing of men in lawful war, or in defence of a man's self, when his own life is in danger, or the execution of malefactors by the hands or order of the civil magistrate, and killing a man at unawares, without any design, are not to be reckoned breaches of this law; but taking away the life of another through private malice and revenge, and even stabbing of a man's character, and so all things tending to or designed for the taking away of life, and all plots, conspiracies, and contrivances for that purpose, even all sinful anger, undue wrath and envy, rancour of all mind, all malice in thought, word, or deed, are contrary to this precept, see <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a> and which, on the other hand, requires that men should do all they can for the ease, peace, and preservation of the lives of men: this is the sixth command, but, in the Septuagint, the strict order in which this and the two following precepts lie is not observed, rehearsing them thus, "thou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill"; and so in <a href="/mark/10-19.htm">Mark 10:19</a> the order is inverted. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> kill.</span><p>(i) But love and preserve your brother's life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

Here the duty is laid down simply as a Divine command: the human penalty for infringing it is prescribed elsewhere (see on <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm" title="He that smites a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.">Exodus 21:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shalt do no murder</span>] AV. had <span class="ital">shalt not kill</span>: but the Heb. word implies violent, unauthorised killing.

Here again is a moral precept included in all codes, and placed by all in a prominent position. Our first duty towards our neighbour is to respect his life. When Cain slew Abel, he could scarcely have known what he was doing; yet a terrible punishment was awarded him for his transgression (<a href="/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11-14</a>). After the flood, the solemn declaration was made, which thenceforward became a universal law among mankind - "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man" (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). In the world that followed the flood, all races of men had the tradition that only blood could expiate blood. In the few places where there was an organised government, and a systematic administration of justice, the State acted on the principle, and punished the murderer capitally. Elsewhere, among tribes and races which had not vet coalesced into states, the law of blood-revenge obtained, and the inquisition for blood became a private affair. The next of kin was the recognised" avenger," upon whom it devolved to hunt out the murderer and punish him. Here the sin is simply and emphatically denounced, the brevity of the precept increasing its force. The Israelites are told that to take life is a crime. God forbids it. As usual, no exceptions are made. Exceptions appear later on (<a href="/numbers/35-22.htm">Numbers 35:22-25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; etc.); but the first thing is to establish the principle. Human life is sacred. Man is not to shed the blood of his fellow-man. If he does, of his hand will the life taken surely be required. The casuistic question whether suicide is forbidden under this precept, probably did not occur to the legislator or to the Hebrews of his time. Neither the Hebrews, nor the Egyptians, among whom they had so long lived, were addicted to suicide; and it is a general rule that laws are not made excepting against tolerably well-known crimes. It has been argued that angry thoughts and insulting words were forbidden by it on the strength of our Lord's comment in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21, 22</a>). But it seems to the present writer that in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-47</a> our Lord is not so much explaining the Jewish law as amplifying it on his own authority - note the repetition of the phrase, "But I say unto you" - and making it mean to Christians what it had not meant to Jews. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Third Word, "Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain," is closely connected with the former two. Although there is no God beside Jehovah, the absolute One, and His divine essence cannot be seen or conceived of under any form, He had made known the glory of His nature in His name (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>., <a href="/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2</a>), and this was not to be abused by His people. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; does not mean to utter the name (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; never has this meaning), but in all the passages in which it has been so rendered it retains its proper meaning, "to take up, life up, raise;" e.g., to take up or raise (begin) a proverb (<a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>), to lift up a song (<a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>), or a prayer (<a href="/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4</a>). And it is evident from the parallel in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, "to lift up his soul to vanity," that it does not mean "to utter" here. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; does not signify a lie (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;), but according to its etymon &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, to be waste, it denotes that which is waste and disorder, hence that which is empty, vain, and nugatory, for which there is no occasion. The word prohibits all employment of the name of God for vain and unworthy objects, and includes not only false swearing, which is condemned in <a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a> as a profanation of the name of Jehovah, but trivial swearing in the ordinary intercourse of life, and every use of the name of God in the service of untruth and lying, for imprecation, witchcraft, or conjuring; whereas the true employment of the name of God is confined to "invocation, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving," which proceeds from a pure, believing heart. The natural heart is very liable to transgress this command, and therefore it is solemnly enforced by the threat, "for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless" (leave him unpunished), etc. </body></html>
