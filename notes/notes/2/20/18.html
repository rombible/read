They felt the near contact with God to be more than they could bear. Even Moses was so deeply moved that he exclaimed, “I exceedingly fear and quake” (<a href="/hebrews/12-21.htm" title="And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)">Hebrews 12:21</a>). The people were still more afraid, and felt compelled to withdraw to a distance, beyond the sound of the terrible voice. From Deuteronomy we learn that they retired within their tents (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-30.htm" title="Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>), having first sent a deputation to Moses, with a request that he would thenceforth act as their intermediary.

That is, they heard the one, and saw the other; they heard the dreadful volleys of thunder, and saw the amazing flashes of lightning, which were like lamps and torches, as the word used signifies; by a communication of senses, one sense is put for another, and the sense of sight being the principal, as Ben Melech observes, it is put for the rest, and so in the following. It is an observation of Austin's (o) that to "see" is used of all of the five senses, seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling: <p>and the noise the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: they the sound of the trumpet, which made them tremble and saw the mountain all in a smoke, which made it look very terrible. Though the words may be rendered, as they are by some, "they perceived the thunders", &amp;c. (p); had a sensible perception of them with their eyes ears, which greatly affected them, and made strong impressions upon their minds, and filled them with fear and dread: <p>and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off; their minds were not only terrified and distressed, and their bodies shook with fear; but they could not stand their ground, but were obliged to retreat, who but just before were curious to draw near, and gaze and see what they could, to prevent which bounds were set; but now these were needless, what they saw and heard were sufficient to keep them at a distance, nay, obliged them to quit their places; they were at the lower part of the mount before, and now they removed a good way from it, even to their camp, and to their tents in it, see <a href="/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>.

The effect produced upon the people by the accumulated terrors of Sinai - "the thunderings and the lightnings, the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking" - the cloud, and the voice out of the cloud - was an awful and terrible fear. They could not bear the manifestation of the near presence of God; and therefore "they removed and stood afar off." It seemed to them as if, on hearing the voice of God, speaking out of the thick darkness, they must die (ver. 19). Moses, upon their expressing these feelings, comforted them with an assurance that God had shown his terrors, not for their injury, but to put his fear in their hearts (ver. 20), and allowed them to retire to a distance from the mount, while he himself "drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people saw the thunderings</span>. The use of a specific verb for a generic one, with terms to all of which it is not, strictly speaking, applicable, is common to many writers, and is known to grammarians as zengma. "Saw" here means "perceived, witnessed." <span class="cmt_word">The mountain smoking</span>. Compare <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>. In <a href="/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23</a> it is said that "the mountain did burn with fire." <span class="cmt_word">When the people saw it, they removed</span>. It appears, from <a href="/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23</a>, that. before retiring, the people sent a deputation of heads of tribes and elders up to Moses in the mount, to convey to him their wishes, and suggest that he should be their intermediary with God. Moses laid their wishes before God, and was directed to give them his sanction, <span class="accented">whereupon they withdrew to their tents</span> (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 30). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fifth Word, "Honour thy father and thy mother," does not refer to fellow-men, but to "those who are the representatives (vicarii) of God. Therefore, as God is to be served with honour and fear, His representatives are to be so too" (Luther decem. praec.). This is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-3.htm">Leviticus 19:3</a>, where reverence towards parents is placed on an equality with the observance of the Sabbath, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; (fear) is substituted for &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; (honour). It also follows from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, which, as Calvin correctly observes, nihil aliud est quam Deo et hominibus, qui dignitate pollent, justum honorem deferre. Fellow-men or neighbours (&#1512;&#1506;) are to be loved (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>): parents, on the other hand, are to be honoured and feared; reverence is to be shown to them with heart, mouth, and hand - in thought, word, and deed. But by father and mother we are not to understand merely the authors and preservers of our bodily life, but also the founders, protectors, and promoters of our spiritual life, such as prophets and teachers, to whom sometimes the name of father is given (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), whilst at other times paternity is ascribed to them by their scholars being called sons and daughters (<a href="/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>, etc.); also the guardians of our bodily and spiritual life, the powers ordained of God, to whom the names of father and mother (<a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>; <a href="/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>) may justly be applied, since all government has grown out of the relation of father and child, and draws its moral weight and stability, upon which the prosperity and well-being of a nation depends, from the reverence of children towards their parents.<p>(Note: "In this demand for reverence to parents, the fifth commandment lays the foundation for the sanctification of the whole social life, inasmuch as it thereby teaches us to acknowledge a divine authority in the same" (Oehler, Dekalog, p. 322).)<p>And the promise, "that thy days may be long (thou mayest live long) in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee," also points to this. There is a double promise here. So long as the nation rejoiced in the possession of obedient children, it was assured of a long life or existence in the land of Canaan; but there is also included the promise of a long life, i.e., a great age, to individuals (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Deuteronomy 22:7</a>), just as we find in <a href="/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a> a good old age referred to as a special blessing from God. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>, the promise of long life is followed by the words, "and that it may be well with thee," which do not later the sense, but merely explain it more fully.<p>As the majesty of God was thus to be honoured and feared in parents, so the image of God was to be kept sacred in all men. This thought forms the transition to the rest of the commandments. </body></html>
