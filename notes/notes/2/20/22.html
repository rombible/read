This intermediate revelation appears to have been at once committed to writing, and in its written shape was known as “the Book of the Covenant “ (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm" title="And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.">Exodus 24:7</a>), and regarded with special veneration.<p>“The Book of the Covenant” is wanting in system and arrangement, but is not wholly unsystematic. It commences with some laws concerning the worship of God (<a href="/context/exodus/20-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.">Exodus 20:22-26</a>), proceeds from the Divine to the human, and treats in its second section (<a href="/context/exodus/21-1.htm" title="Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them.">Exodus 21:1-32</a>) of “the rights of persons,” then concerns itself with “the rights of property” (<a href="/exodus/21-33.htm" title="And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;">Exodus 21:33</a> to <a href="/exodus/22-15.htm" title="But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.">Exodus 22:15</a>), and, finally, winds up with “miscellaneous laws” (<a href="/exodus/22-16.htm" title="And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.">Exodus 22:16</a> to <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm" title="The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Exodus 23:19</a>), partly on things Divine, partly on things human—the things Divine being reserved to the last, so that the end of the legislation is in close harmony with the beginning. Altogether, the enactments contained in the short space of three chapters are some seventy; and the “Book of the Covenant” is thus no mere tentative sketch; but a very wonderful condensation of the essence of all the more important matters which Moses afterwards put forth by Divine inspiration in the long space of nearly forty years.<p><span class= "bld">LAWS CONCERNING RELIGION.</span><p>(22) <span class= "bld">Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</span>—It was important to identify the giver of the Book of the Covenant with the deliverer of the Ten Commandments, and accordingly this was done in the opening words of the Book.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:22-26 Moses having entered into the thick darkness, God there spake in his hearing all that follows from hence to the end of chap. 23, which is mostly an exposition of the ten commandments.

The stage of society for which the Code was designed, and the characteristics of the Code itself, are well indicated by W. R. Smith (<span class="ital">OTJC.</span>2[180] p. 340 ff). ‘The society contemplated in it is of very simple structure. The basis of life is agricultural. Cattle and agricultural produce are the main elements wealth; and the laws of property deal almost exclusively with them (see <a href="/exodus/21-28.htm" title="If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.">Exodus 21:28</a> to <a href="/exodus/22-10.htm" title="If a man deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:">Exodus 22:10</a>). The principles of criminal and civil justice are those still current among the Arabs of the desert, viz. retaliation and pecuniary compensation. Murder is dealt with by the law of blood-revenge; but the innocent man-slayer may seek asylum at God’s altar (cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-18.htm" title="And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.">1 Kings 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-29.htm" title="And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.">1 Kings 2:29</a>).’ Man-stealing, offences against parents, and witchcraft are also punishable by death. Personal injuries fall mostly, like murder, under the law of retaliation (Exo <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm" title="Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,">Exodus 21:24</a><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> - THE BOOK OF THE COVENANT, (chap. 20. ver. 22, to chap. 22. ver. 23). The Decalogue is followed by a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, which occupy the remainder of ch. 20. and the whole of the three following chapters (ch. 21, 22. and 23.). It appears from ch. 24. that these laws, received by Moses on Sinai, immediately after the delivery of the ten commandments, were at once committed to  writing and collected into a book, which was known as "the Book of the Covenant" (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>), and was regarded as a specially sacred volume. The document, as it has come down to us, "cannot be regarded as a strictly systematic whole" (Canon Cook): yet still, it is not wholly unsystematic,but aims in some degree at an orderly arrangement. First and foremost are placed the laws which concern the worship of God, which are two in number: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Against idols; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Concerning altars (<a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23-26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then follow the laws respecting what our legal writers call "the rights of persons" -  which occupy thirty-two verses of ch. 21. and fall under some twenty different heads, beginning with the rights of slaves, and terminating with the compensation to be made for injuries to the person caused by cattle. The third section is upon "the rights of property," and extends from <a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33</a>, to <a href="/exodus/22-15.htm">Exodus 22:15</a>, including some ten or twelve enactments. After this we can only say that the laws are mixed, some being concerned with Divine things (as ch. 22:20, 29, 30; and ch. 23. 10-19): others with human, and these last being of various kinds, all, however, more or less "connected with the civil organization of the state" (Kalisch). In the fourth section the enactments seem to fall under about twenty-five heads. The result is that the "Book of the Covenant" contains, in little more than three chapters, about seventy distinct laws. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven</span>. The book opened with this reminder, which at once recalled its author and declared its authority. "I, who give these laws, am the same who spake the ten commandments amid the thunders of Sinai. Reverence the laws accordingly." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The other Five Words or commandments, which determine the duties to one's neighbour, are summed up in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> in the one word, "Love thy neighbour as thyself." The order in which they follow one another is the following: they first of all secure life, marriage, and property against active invasion or attack, and then, proceeding from deed to word and thought, they forbid false witness and coveting.<p>(Note: Luther has pointed out this mirum et aptum ordinem, and expounds it thus: Incipit prohibitio a majori usque ad minimum, nam maximum damnum est occisio hominis, deinde proximum violatio conjugis, tertium ablatio facultatis. Quod qui in iis nocere non possunt, saltem lingua nocent, ideo quartum est laesio famae. Quodsi in iis non praevalent omnibus, saltem corde laedunt proximum, cupiendo quae ejus sunt, in quo et invidia proprie consistit.)<p>If, therefore, the first three commandments in this table refer primarily to deeds; the subsequent advance to the prohibition of desire is a proof that the deed is not to be separated from the disposition, and that "the fulfilment of the law is only complete when the heart itself is sanctified" (Oehler). Accordingly, in the command, "Thou shalt not kill," not only is the accomplished fact of murder condemned, whether it proceed from open violence or stratagem (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a>), but every act that endangers human life, whether it arise from carelessness (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a>) or wantonness (<a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>), or from hatred, anger, and revenge (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17-18</a>). Life is placed at the head of these commandments, not as being the highest earthly possession, but because it is the basis of human existence, and in the life the personality is attacked, and in that the image of God (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The omission of the object still remains to be noticed, as showing that the prohibition includes not only the killing of a fellow-man, but the destruction of one's own life, or suicide. - The two following commandments are couched in equally general terms. Adultery, &#1504;&#1488;&#1507;, which is used in <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a> of both man and woman, signifies (as distinguished from &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; to commit fornication) the sexual intercourse of a husband with the wife of another, or of a wife with the husband of another. This prohibition is not only directed against any assault upon the husband's dearest possession, for the tenth commandment guards against that, but upholds the sacredness of marriage as the divine appointment for the propagation and multiplication of the human race; and although addressed primarily to the man, like all the commandments that were given to the whole nation, applies quite as much to the woman as to the man, just as we find in <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a> that adultery was to be punished with death in the case of both the man and the woman. - Property was to be equally inviolable. The command, "Thou shalt not steal," prohibited not only the secret or open removal of another person's property, but injury done to it, or fraudulent retention of it, through carelessness or indifference (<a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-13.htm">Exodus 22:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4-5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-4</a>). - But lest these commandments should be understood as relating merely to the outward act as such, as they were by the Pharisees, in opposition to whom Christ set forth their true fulfilment (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a>.), God added the further prohibition, "Thou shalt not answer as a false witness against thy neighbour," i.e., give false testimony against him. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;: to answer or give evidence against a person (<a href="/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>). &#1506;&#1491; is not evidence, but a witness. Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1506;&#1491;, a witness of a lie, who consciously gives utterance to falsehood, we find &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1491; in Deuteronomy, one who says what is vain, worthless, unfounded (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, <a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; on &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; see <a href="/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>). From this it is evident, that not only is lying prohibited, but false and unfounded evidence in general; and not only evidence before a judge, but false evidence of every kind, by which (according to the context) the life, married relation, or property of a neighbour might be endangered (cf. <a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13</a>.). - The last or tenth commandment is directed against desiring (coveting), as the root from which every sin against a neighbour springs, whether it be in word or deed. The &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (lxx), coveting, proceeds from the heart (<a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>), and brings forth sin, which "is finished" in the act (<a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). The repetition of the words, "Thou shalt not covet," does not prove that there are two different commandments, any more than the substitution of &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-18.htm">Deuteronomy 5:18</a> for the second &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;. &#1495;&#1502;&#1491; and &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; are synonyms, - the only difference between them being, that "the former denotes the desire as founded upon the perception of beauty, and therefore excited from without, the latter, desire originating at the very outset in the person himself, and arising from his own want or inclination" (Schultz). The repetition merely serves to strengthen and give the great emphasis to that which constitutes the very kernel of the command, and is just as much in harmony with the simple and appropriate language of the law, as the employment of a synonym in the place of the repetition of the same word is with the rhetorical character of Deuteronomy. Moreover, the objects of desire do not point to two different commandments. This is evident at once from the transposition of the house and wife in Deuteronomy. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (the house) is not merely the dwelling, but the entire household (as in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>; <a href="/job/8-15.htm">Job 8:15</a>), either including the wife, or exclusive of her. In the text before us she is included; in Deuteronomy she is not, but is placed first as the crown of the man, and a possession more costly than pearls (<a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>). In this case, the idea of the "house" is restricted to the other property belonging to the domestic economy, which is classified in Deuteronomy as fields, servants, cattle, and whatever else a man may have; whereas in Exodus the "house" is divided into wife, servants, cattle, and the rest of the possessions. </body></html>
