It is not improbable that the work of creation was made to occupy six days because one day in seven is the appropriate proportion of rest to labour for such a being as man. God might have created all things on one day had He so pleased; but, having the institution of the Sabbath in view, He prefigured it by spreading His work over six days, and then resting on the seventh. His law of the Sabbath established a conformity between the method of His own working and that of His reasonable creatures, and taught men to look on work, not as an aimless, indefinite, incessant, weary round, but as leading on to an end, a rest, a fruition, a time for looking back, and seeing the result and rejoicing in it. Each Sabbath is such a time, and is a type and foretaste of that eternal “sabbatising” in another world which “remaineth for the people of God” (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>). The secondary object of the institution of the Sabbath, assigned in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm" title="And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out there through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, is in no way incompatible with this primary one. The thought of God’s works in creation might well be associated in the mind of an. Israelite with the thought of His “wondrous works” in Egypt, and the recollection of the blessed peace and rest in which creation resulted, with the memory of the glad time of repose and refreshment which supervened upon the weary task work of the Egyptian bondage.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:3-11 The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRST table, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. It cannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is false to his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship, JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden. Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship, breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. The second commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lord our God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, in any form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, or picture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further. All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of mere human inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concerns the manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence and seriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God, all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters not whether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things break this commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them. The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. The form of the fourth commandment, Remember, shows that it was not now first given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is to be kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so as to neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those days we must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day. Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all works of luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden. Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business, worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, are not keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be a carnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day of rest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. The advantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to the health and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for taking care of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day is blessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and direction to keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of the sabbath day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sabbath ... - a Sabbath to Yahweh thy God.

Remember the sabbath day&#8212;implying it was already known, and recognized as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments [Ex 20:3-11] comprise our duties to God&#8212;the other six [Ex 20:12-17] our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach to the government of the heart as well as the lip (Mt 5:17).

The note of Jarchi is,"he blessed it with manna, by giving double bread on the sixth, and sanctified it by manna, that it might not descend on it;''so that there was a provision made for it, which was blessing it; and it was distinguished from all other days, no manna falling on it, which was the sanctification of it; and all showed it to be a day the Lord had a particular regard to, and that it was to be a day of rest, and exemption from labour. (This verse shows that the days in the first chapter of Genesis were real twenty four hour days. For you compare like things to like. Just as God worked six days and rested on the seventh, so the Israelites were to do also. The comparison would make no sense if the days were "seven ages" or were "seven ages" that overlapped each other (Day Age Theory) or if there was a huge gap between the days (Gap Theory). These are modern compromises to accomodate the alleged geological ages with the Biblical account of creation.Further this verse allows one to determine the age of the universe. Using the biblical geneologies Bishop Ussher determined the date of creation to be 4004 B.C. Although this may be off by one or two percent, it is a very accurate estimate based on biblical revelation not man's speculation.

It is not impossible that ultimately the institution was of Babylonian origin: in Babylonian there occurs (though rarely) the word <span class="ital">shabattum</span>, meaning day for propitiating a deity’s anger1[178], and in Babylonia also, especially in the earlier periods of the history, every seventh day of the month was marked by abstention from secular business2[179]: but even if that was the case (for connecting links are still wanting), it is certain that when adopted by the Hebrews, a new character was impressed upon it by the higher and purer religion of Israel. In the earliest legislation of the Hebrews, the sabbath appears as a day of cessation from (in particular) <span class="ital">field-work</span>, designed with a humanitarian end (<a href="/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a> E; <a href="/exodus/34-21.htm" title="Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ripening time and in harvest you shall rest.">Exodus 34:21</a> J), and, to judge from the context, possessing already a religious character: in the Decalogue, in what is probably (see above) the oldest part of the Commandment, it is to be kept ‘holy’ by the Israelite: in the early historical books, it is associated with the ‘new moon,’ in a manner which implies that both were occasions of intermission from labour and trade (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm" title="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?">Amos 8:5</a>), and holidays (<a href="/context/2_kings/4-22.htm" title="And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again....">2 Kings 4:22-23</a>); Hosea (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a>), and Isaiah (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm" title="And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:">Exodus 1:13</a>), both allude to it as a day of religious observance. In later times, both the religious observances and also the abstention from labour were increasingly emphasized. In H and Ezek. (see on <a href="/ezekiel/31-13.htm" title="On his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be on his branches:">Ezekiel 31:13</a>) the observance of the sabbath is repeatedly insisted on: cf. a little later <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm" title="Blessed is the man that does this, and the son of man that lays hold on it; that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.">Isaiah 56:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm" title="If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shall honor him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:">Isaiah 58:13</a> f., and (in the ideal future) <a href="/isaiah/66-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:23</a>. Ezekiel, also, in his ideal legislation for the future (chs. 40–48), gives directions,—based, presumably, upon already existing usage,—respecting the sacrifices to be offered every sabbath by the ‘prince’ on behalf o the nation in the restored temple (<a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm" title="And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm" title="And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.">Ezekiel 46:4</a> f.).

(On the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; with the o-sound under the guttural, see Ewald, 251d.). &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; signifies bending before God in prayer, and invoking His name; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, worship by means of sacrifice and religious ceremonies. The suffixes &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; and - &#1501; (to them, and them) refer to the things in heaven, etc., which are made into pesel, symbols of Jehovah, as being the principal object of the previous clause, and not to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, although &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is applied in <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a> and <a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a> to a rude idolatrous worship, which identifies the image as the symbol of deity with the deity itself, Still less do they refer to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>.<p>The threat and promise, which follow in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>, relate to the first two commandments, and not to the second alone; because both of them, although forbidding two forms of idolatry, viz., idolo-latry and ikono-latry, are combined in a higher unity, by the fact, that whenever Jehovah, the God who cannot be copied because He reveals His spiritual nature in no visible form, is worshipped under some visible image, the glory of the invisible God is changed, or Jehovah changed into a different God from what He really is. Through either form of idolatry, therefore, Israel would break its covenant with Jehovah. For this reason God enforces the two commandments with the solemn declaration: "I, Jehovah thy God, am &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500; a jealous God;" i.e., not only &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, a zealous avenger of sinners, but &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a jealous God, who will not transfer to another the honour that is due to Himself (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>), nor tolerate the worship of any other god (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>), but who directs the warmth of His anger against those who hate Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>), with the same energy with which the warmth of His love (Sol 8:6) embraces those who love Him, except that love in the form of grace reaches much further than wrath. The sin of the fathers He visits (punishes) on the children to the third and fourth generation. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; third (sc., children) are not grandchildren, but great-grandchildren, and &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; the fourth generation. On the other hand He shows mercy to the thousandths, i.e., to the thousandth generation (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, where &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; stands for &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;). The cardinal number is used here for the ordinal, for which there was no special form in the case of &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;. The words &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;, in which the punishment and grace are traced to their ultimate foundation, are of great importance to a correct understanding of this utterance of God. The &#1500; before &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; does not take up the genitive with &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; again, as Knobel supposes, for no such use of &#1500; can be established from <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, or in fact in any way whatever. In this instance &#1500; signifies "at" or "in relation to;" and &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;, from its very position, cannot refer to the fathers alone, but to the fathers and children to the third and fourth generation. If it referred to the fathers alone, it would necessarily stand after &#1488;&#1489;&#1514;. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; is to be taken in the same way. God punishes the sin of the fathers in the children to the third and fourth generation in relation to those who hate Him, and shows mercy to the thousandth generation in relation to those who love Him. The human race is a living organism, in which not only sin and wickedness are transmitted, but evil as the curse of the sin and the punishment of the wickedness. As children receive their nature from their parents, or those who beget them, so they have also to bear and atone for their fathers' guilt. This truth forced itself upon the minds even of thoughtful heathen from their own varied experience (cf. Aeschyl. Sept. 744; Eurip. according to Plutarch de sera num. vind. 12, 21; Cicero de nat. deorum 3, 38; and Baumgarten-Crusius, bibl. Theol. p. 208). Yet there is no fate in the divine government of the world, no irresistible necessity in the continuous results of good and evil; but there reigns in the world a righteous and gracious God, who not only restrains the course of His penal judgments, as soon as the sinner is brought to reflection by the punishment and hearkens to the voice of God, but who also forgives the sin and iniquity of those who love Him, keeping mercy to the thousandth generation (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>). The words neither affirm that sinning fathers remain unpunished, nor that the sins of fathers are punished in the children and grandchildren without any fault of their own: they simply say nothing about whether and how the fathers themselves are punished; and, in order to show the dreadful severity of the penal righteousness of God, give prominence to the fact, that punishment is not omitted-that even when, in the long-suffering of God, it is deferred, it is not therefore neglected, but that the children have to bear the sins of their fathers, whenever, for example (as naturally follows from the connection of children with their fathers, and, as Onkelos has added in his paraphrase of the words), "the children fill up the sins of their fathers," so that the descendants suffer punishment for both their own and their forefathers' misdeeds (<a href="/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>; <a href="/amos/7-17.htm">Amos 7:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>.; <a href="/daniel/9-16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a>). But when, on the other hand, the hating ceases, when the children forsake their fathers' evil ways, the warmth of the divine wrath is turned into the warmth of love, and God becomes &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; ("showing mercy") to them; and this mercy endures not only to the third and fourth generation, but to the thousandth generation, though only in relation to those who love God, and manifest this love by keeping His commandments. "If God continues for a long time His visitation of sin, He continues to all eternity His manifestation of mercy, and we cannot have a better proof of this than in the history of Israel itself" (Schultz).<p>(Note: On the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children, see also Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. ii. p. 446ff.) </body></html>
