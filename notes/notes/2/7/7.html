He makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the performance of his promises to them, and the Egyptians by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Moses, as the ambassador of Jehovah, speaking in his name, laid commands upon Pharaoh, denounced threatenings against him, and called for judgments upon him. Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Moses stood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to be meant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh.

At this time, which is observed partly to show how long Israel had been afflicted in Egypt; for their great troubles and miseries began about the time of the birth of Moses, or a little before, as appears from the above history; and partly to show the patience and forbearance of God with the Egyptians, and how just and righteous were his judgments on them; with this perfectly agrees Stephen's account of the age of Moses, <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a> and Aaron eighty three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh; so that they were men that had had a large experience of things, and had been long training up for the service designed to be done by them; they were men of wisdom and prudence, of sedate and composed countenances, and fit to appear before a king, whose age and venerable aspect might command attention to them. Aben Ezra observes, that"in all the Scripture there is no mention of any prophets that prophesied in their old age but these, because their excellency was greater than all the prophets.''By this it appears that Aaron was three years older than Moses. A Jewish chronologer says (n), that it is affirmed in an exposition of theirs, that Aaron prophesied to the Israelites in Egypt eighty years, which is making him to be a very young prophet when he first entered into the office.

This age is confirmed by the statement (in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>) that Moses was a hundred and twenty at his death. It is also accepted as exact by St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23, 30</a>). Moderns are surprised that at such an age a man could undertake and carry through a difficult and dangerous enterprise; but in Egypt one hundred and ten years was not considered a very exceptionally long life, and men frequently retained their full vigour till seventy or eighty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses' last difficulty (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>, repeated in <a href="/exodus/6-30.htm">Exodus 6:30</a>) was removed by God with the words: "See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet" (<a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>, Moses was to be a god to Aaron; and in harmony with that, Aaron is here called the prophet of Moses, as being the person who would announce to Pharaoh the revelations of Moses. At the same time Moses was also made a god to Pharaoh; i.e., he was promised divine authority and power over Pharaoh, so that henceforth there was no more necessity for him to be afraid of the king of Egypt, but the latter, notwithstanding all resistance, would eventually bow before him. Moses was a god to Aaron as the revealer of the divine will, and to Pharaoh as the executor of that will. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2-5</a> God repeats in a still more emphatic form His assurance, that notwithstanding the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, He would bring His people Israel out of Egypt. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2</a>) does not mean ut dimittat or mittat (Vulg.
