He makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the performance of his promises to them, and the Egyptians by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Moses, as the ambassador of Jehovah, speaking in his name, laid commands upon Pharaoh, denounced threatenings against him, and called for judgments upon him. Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Moses stood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to be meant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh. At length Moses is delivered from his fears. He makes no more objections, but, being strengthened in faith, goes about his work with courage, and proceeds in it with perseverance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wonders - A word used only of portents performed to prove a divine interposition; they were the credentials of God's messengers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.
