Egypt was the greatest monarchy in the whole world. She was now at the height of her glory. Among existent polytheisms, hers was the most famous; and her gods must have seemed, not only to herself, but to all the surrounding nations, the most powerful. To discredit them was to throw discredit upon polytheism generally, and to exalt the name of Jehovah above that of all the deities of the nations. (Comp. <a href="/context/exodus/14-11.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?">Exodus 14:11-16</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 God glorifies himself. He makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the performance of his promises to them, and the Egyptians by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Moses, as the ambassador of Jehovah, speaking in his name, laid commands upon Pharaoh, denounced threatenings against him, and called for judgments upon him. Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Moses stood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to be meant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh. At length Moses is delivered from his fears. He makes no more objections, but, being strengthened in faith, goes about his work with courage, and proceeds in it with perseverance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wonders - A word used only of portents performed to prove a divine interposition; they were the credentials of God's messengers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.
