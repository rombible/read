Those whom God called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill, even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The engraver - The artificer, literally "one who cuts": a general name for the workman, to which was added the name of the material in which he worked; thus the artificer in wood, or carpenter; the artificer in iron, or smith, etc. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-32.htm">Exodus 35:32-33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4-5</a> enumerate the branches of work committed to Bezaleel. What was under the charge of Aholiab is here for the first time clearly distinguished into the work of the skilled weaver, that of the embroiderer, and that of the weaver.<p>The cunning workman - The skilled weaver, literally, "the reckoner". He might have been so called because he had nicely to count and calculate the threads in weaving figures after the manner of tapestry or carpet. His work was chiefly used in the curtains and veil of the tabernacle, in the ephod and the breastplate (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15</a>, etc.).<p>The embroiderer - He worked with a needle, either shaping his design in stitches of colored thread, or in pieces of colored cloth sewn upon the groundwork. His work was employed in the entrance curtains of the tent and the court, and in the girdle of the high priest <a href="/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; <a href="/exodus/27-16.htm">Exodus 27:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>.<p>The weaver - He appears to have worked in the loom in the ordinary way with materials of only a single color. The tissues made by him were used for the robe of the ephod and its binding, and for the coats of the priests <a href="/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22</a>, <a href="/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>.<p>These three classes of workers were men, while the spinners and dyers were women <a href="/exodus/35-25.htm">Exodus 35:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart&#8212;A statement which not only testifies that skill in art and science is a direct gift from God, but that weaving was especially the business of men in Egypt (see Ex 38:22; 39:22, 27). And in perfect harmony with the testimony of the monuments is the account given by Moses to the artists who were divinely taught the arts necessary for the embellishment of the tabernacle. Others, whose limited means did not admit of these expensive contributions, offered their gratuitous services in fabricating such articles of tapestry as were needed; arts which the Israelitish females learned as bondwomen, in the houses of Egyptian princes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart,....

The methods of working here spoken of are, all of them, such as were well known in Egypt at the time, and which, consequently, it would have been quite natural for some of the Israelites to have learnt. We are not to suppose that God supernaturally communicated to Bezaleel and Aholiab the technical knowledge required in their occupations, but only that he gave them genius and artistic skill, so that both their designs, and their execution of them, were of unusual excellence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The precious stones for the robes of the high priest, and the spices for the incense and anointing oil, were presented by the princes of the congregation, who had such costly things in their possession. </body></html>
