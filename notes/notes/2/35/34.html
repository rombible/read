Those whom God called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill, even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Curious works, cunning work - Works of skill.
