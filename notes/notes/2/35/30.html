Those whom God called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill, even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The precious stones <a href="/exodus/28-9.htm">Exodus 28:9</a> and spices were contributed by the rulers, who were more wealthy than the other Israelites. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

Though, in some real sense, "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," still Moses was probably devoid of the technical knowledge requisite for a "superintendent of the works" on the present occasion. At any rate, his other duties imperatively required that he should decline to undertake, in addition to them, so onerous an office. And God had told him whom it would be best for him to set over the work (<a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>). Accordingly, he now made known to the people that the construction of the tabernacle and its appurtenances would be committed to two men - Bezaleel, the son of Uri, as principal, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, as his assist-ant - who would "teach" those under them what they were to do (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath called</span>, etc See <a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>: - "I have called by name Bezaleel," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Judah</span>. The descent of Bezaleel from Judah has been already traced. (See the comment on Exodus 31:2.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Preliminaries to the Work. - <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-1.htm">Exodus 35:1-29</a>. After the restoration of the covenant, Moses announced to the people the divine commands with reference to the holy place of the tabernacle which was to be built. He repeated first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-1.htm">Exodus 35:1-3</a>) the law of the Sabbath according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>, and strengthened it by the announcement, that on the Sabbath no fire was to be kindled in their dwelling, because this rule was to be observed even in connection with the work to be done for the tabernacle. (For a fuller comment, see at <a href="/exodus/20-9.htm">Exodus 20:9</a>.). Then, in accordance with the command of Jehovah, he first of all summoned the whole nation to present freewill-offerings for the holy things to be prepared (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-4.htm">Exodus 35:4</a>, <a href="/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>), mentioning one by one all the materials that would be required (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5-9</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3-7</a>); and after that he called upon those who were endowed with understanding to prepare the different articles, as prescribed in ch. 25-30, mentioning these also one by one (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-11.htm">Exodus 35:11-19</a>), even down to the pegs of the dwelling and court (<a href="/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>), and "their cords," i.e., the cords required to fasten the tent and the hangings round the court to the pegs that were driven into the ground, which had not been mentioned before, being altogether subordinate things. (On the "cloths of service," <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-19.htm">Exodus 35:19</a>, see at <a href="/exodus/31-10.htm">Exodus 31:10</a>.) In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-29</a> we have an account of the fulfilment of this command. The people went from Moses, i.e., from the place where they were assembled round Moses, away to their tents, and willingly offered the things required as a heave-offering for Jehovah; every one "whom his heart lifted up," i.e., who felt himself inclined and stirred up in his heart to do this. The men along with (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; see Ewald, 217) the women brought with a willing heart all kinds of golden rings and jewellery: chak, lit., hook, here a clasp or ring; nezem, an ear or nose-ring (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-47.htm">Genesis 24:47</a>); tabbaath, a finger-ring; cumaz, globulus aureus, probably little golden balls strung together like beads, which were worn by the Israelites and Midianites (<a href="/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>) as an ornament round the wrist and neck, as Diod. Sic. relates that they were by the Arabians (3, 44). "All kinds of golden jewellery, and every one who had waved (dedicated) a wave (offering) of gold to Jehovah," sc., offered it for the work of the tabernacle. The meaning is, that in addition to the many varieties of golden ornaments, which were willingly offered for the work to be performed, every one brought whatever gold he had set apart as a wave-offering (a sacrificial gift) for Jehovah. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507; to wave, lit., to swing or move to and fro, is used in connection with the sacrificial ritual to denote a peculiar ceremony, through which certain portions of a sacrifice, which were not intended for burning upon the altar, but for the maintenance of the priests (<a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>), were consecrated to the Lord, or given up to Him in a symbolical manner (see at <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>). Tenuphah, the wave-offering, accordingly denoted primarily those portions of the sacrificial animal which were allotted to the priests as their share of the sacrifices; and then, in a more general sense, every gift or offering that was consecrated to the Lord for the establishment and maintenance of the sanctuary and its worship. In this wider sense the term tenuphah (wave-offering) is applied both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, <a href="/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a> to the gold and copper presented by the congregation for the building of the tabernacle. So that it does not really differ from terumah, a lift of heave-offering, as every gift intended for the erection and maintenance of the sanctuary was called, inasmuch as the offerer lifted it off from his own property, to dedicate it to the Lord for the purposes of His worship. Accordingly, in <a href="/exodus/35-24.htm">Exodus 35:24</a> the freewill-offerings of the people in silver and gold for the erection of the tabernacle are called terumah; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm">Exodus 36:6</a>, all the gifts of metal, wood, leather, and woven materials, presented by the people for the erection of the tabernacle, are called &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;. (On heaving and the heave-offering, see at <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>.) </body></html>
