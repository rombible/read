The legislator extends this duty to cases where the owner is our personal enemy. It was not generally recognised in antiquity that men’s enemies had any claims upon them. Cicero, indeed, says—“Sunt autem quædam officia etiam adversus eos servanda, a quibus injuriam aceeperis” (<span class= "ital">De Off. i.</span> 11); but he stops short of enjoining active benevolence.

In Dt. the comprehensive term ‘brother,’ i.e. fellow-countryman, is employed, in accordance with the prevalent usage of that book (cf. <a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-2.htm" title="And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release....">Deuteronomy 15:2-3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm" title="Beware that there be not a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to the LORD against you, and it be sin to you.">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-11.htm" title="For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land....">Deuteronomy 15:11-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm" title="You shall in any wise set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brothers shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.">Deuteronomy 17:15</a> <span class="ital">al.</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4, 5</span>.

They can hardly be here in their original place; for they evidently interrupt the connexion between <span class="ital">vv.</span> 1–3 and <span class="ital">vv.</span> 6–9: they would follow better after <a href="/exodus/22-24.htm" title="And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.">Exodus 22:24</a> or 27.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine enemy's ox</span>. A private enemy is here spoken of, not a public one, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>. It is remarkable that the law should have so far anticipated Christianity as to have laid it down that men have duties of friendliness even towards their enemies, and are bound under certain circumstances to render them a service. "Hate thine enemies" (<a href="/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>) was no injunction of the Mosaic taw, but a conclusion which Rabbinical teachers unwarrantably drew from it. Christianity, however, goes far beyond Mosaism in laying down the broad precept - "Love your enemies." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thy fulness and thy flowing thou shalt not delay (to Me)." &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; fulness, signifies the produce of corn (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>); and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506; (lit., tear, flowing, liquor stillans), which only occurs here, is a poetical epithet for the produce of the press, both wine and oil (cf. &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, lxx; arborum lacrimae, Plin. 11:6).

That the command not to delay and not to withhold the fulness, etc., relates to the offering of the first-fruits of the field and vineyard, as is more fully defined in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2-11</a>, is evident from what follows, in which the law given at the exodus from Egypt, with reference to the sanctification of the first-born of man and beast (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>), is repeated and incorporated in the rights of Israel, inasmuch as the adoption of the first-born on the part of Jehovah was a perpetual guarantee to the whole nation of the right of covenant fellowship.
