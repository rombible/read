The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will cut them off - The national existence of the Canaanites was indeed to be "utterly" destroyed, every trace of their idolatries was to be blotted out, no social contact was to be held with them while they served other gods, nor were alliances of any kind to be formed with them.

But it is alike contrary to the spirit of the divine law, and to the facts bearing on the subject scattered in the history, to suppose that any obstacle was put in the way of well disposed individuals of the denounced nations who left their sins and were willing to join the service of Yahweh.

Though Christians have no such special pledge, there is, no doubt, that virtuous and godly living would greatly conduce to health, and take away half the sicknesses from which men suffer, even at the present day. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The next command in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> has reference to the feast of Harvest, or feast of Weeks. In "the first-fruits of thy land" there is an unmistakeable allusion to "the first-fruits of thy labours" in <a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>. It is true the words, "the first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God," are so general in their character, that we can hardly restrict them to the wave-loaves to be offered as first-fruits at the feast of Weeks, but must interpret them as referring to all the first-fruits, which they had already been commanded not to delay to offer (<a href="/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>), and the presentation of which is minutely prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12-13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2-11</a>, - including therefore the sheaf of barley to be offered in the second day of the feast of unleavened bread (<a href="/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9</a>.). At the same time the reference to the feast of Weeks is certainly to be retained, inasmuch as this feast was an express admonition to Israel, to offer the first of the fruits of the Lord. In the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, the latter might be understood as explanatory of the former and in apposition to it, since they are both of them applied to the first-fruits of the soil (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>, and <a href="/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>). But as &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; could hardly need any explanation in this connection, the partitive sense is to be preferred; though it is difficult to decide whether "the first of the first-fruits" signifies the first selection from the fruits that had grown, ripened, and been gathered first-that is to say, not merely of the entire harvest, but of every separate production of the field and soil, according to the rendering of the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, - or whether the word &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is used figuratively, and signifies the best of the first-fruits. There is no force in the objection offered to the former view, that "in no other case in which the offering of first-fruits generally is spoken of, is one particular portion represented as holy to Jehovah, but the first-fruits themselves are that portion of the entire harvest which was holy to Jehovah." For, apart from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>, where a different rendering is sometimes given to &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, the expression &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a> shows unmistakeably that only a portion of the first of all the fruit of the ground had to be offered to the Lord. On the other hand, this view is considerably strengthened by the fact, that whilst &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; signify those fruits which ripened first, i.e., earliest, &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is used to denote the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;, the first portion or first selection from the whole, not only in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>, and most probably in <a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a> as well. - Now if these directions do not refer either exclusively or specially to the loaves of first-fruits of the feast of Weeks, the opinion which has prevailed from the time of Abarbanel to that of Knobel, that the following command, "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk," refers to the feast of Ingathering, is deprived of its principal support. And any such allusion is rendered very questionable by the fact, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, where this command is repeated, it is appended to the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal that had been torn to pieces. Very different explanations have been given to the command. In the Targum, Mishnah, etc., it is regarded as a general prohibition against eating flesh prepared with milk. Luther and others suppose it to refer to the cooking of the kid, before it has been weaned from its mother's milk. But the actual reference is to the cooking of a kid in the milk of its own mother, as indicating a contempt of the relation which God has established and sanctified between parent and young, and thus subverting the divine ordinances. As kids were a very favourite food (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-9.htm">Genesis 27:9</a>, <a href="/genesis/27-14.htm">Genesis 27:14</a>; <a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>; <a href="/judges/13-15.htm">Judges 13:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>), it is very likely that by way of improving the flavour they were sometimes cooked in milk. According to Aben Ezra and Abarbanel, this was a custom adopted by the Ishmaelites; and at the present day the Arabs are in the habit of cooking lamb in sour milk. A restriction is placed upon this custom in the prohibition before us, but there is no intention to prevent the introduction of a superstitious usage customary at the sacrificial meals of other nations, which Spencer and Knobel have sought to establish as at all events probable, though without any definite historical proofs, and for the most part on the strength of far-fetched analogies. </body></html>
