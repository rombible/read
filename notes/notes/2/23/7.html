A doubtful case was rather to be left to God Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. <a href="/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>.<p>(c) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert judgment <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; compare <a href="/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>.<p>(d) To vindicate the rights of the stranger <a href="/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> - rather, the foreigner.
