But if the verb did signify only <span class="ital">to leave</span>, it may be thus rendered according to the Hebrew words, <span class="ital">then</span>, or <span class="ital">therefore</span>, or <span class="ital">surely</span> (for all these ways the Hebrew particle <span class="ital">vau</span> is used) thou shalt forbear to leave it, to wit, the ass groaning under his burden, or the lifting up of the ass and burden, to him alone; but if thou wilt be leaving, I will appoint thee a better object for it, thou shalt surely leave or lay aside what thou hast against him, i.e. whatsoever controversy thou hast with him, that shall not hinder thee from succouring him or his in any distress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew preposition <span class="ital">in</span>, doth oft signify <span class="ital">against</span>, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/26-20.htm" title="And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.">Genesis 26:20</a> <a href="/psalms/85-4.htm" title="Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause your anger toward us to cease.">Psalm 85:4</a> 94:16 <a href="/hosea/9-8.htm" title="The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.">Hosea 9:8</a></span>.

The difficulty could be removed by reading in the last clause, with Bochart, Bä., <span class="ital">thou shalt</span> <span class="bld">surely help</span> <span class="ital">with him</span> (<span class="greekheb">עזר תעזר</span> for <span class="greekheb">עזב תעזב</span>).
