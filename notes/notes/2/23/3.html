For however great the compassion of God may be for the poor, and how much soever he may recommend them to our care and protection, he would not have our tenderness for them carry us to countenance them unjustly, or give a wrong judgment for their sakes.

After the many precepts in favour of the poor, this injunction produces a sort of shock. But it is to be understood as simply forbidding any undue favouring of the poor because they are poor, and so as equivalent to the precept in <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor." In courts of justice, strict justice is to be rendered, without any leaning either towards the rich, or towards the poor. To lean either way is to pervert judgment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thou shalt not despise God, and the prince among thy people thou shalt not curse." Elohim does not mean either the gods of other nations, as Josephus, Philo, and others, in their dead and work-holy monotheism, have rendered the word; or the rulers, as Onkelos and others suppose; but simply God, deity in general, whose majesty was despised in every break of the commandments of Jehovah, and who was to be honoured in the persons of the rulers (cf. <a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). Contempt of God consists not only in blasphemies of Jehovah openly expressed, which were to be punished with death (<a href="/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>.), but in disregard of His threats with reference to the oppression of the poorer members of His people (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-27</a>), and in withholding from them what they ought to receive (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29-31</a>). Understood in this way, the command is closely connected not only with what precedes, but also with what follows. The prince (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, lit., the elevated one) is mentioned by the side of God, because in his exalted position he has to administer the law of God among His people, and to put a stop to what is wrong. </body></html>
