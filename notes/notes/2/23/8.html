Corruption has been always rife in the East, and the pure administration of justice is almost unknown there. Signal punishments by wise rulers have sometimes checked the inveterate evil (Herod. v. 25). But it recurs again and again—“Naturam expellas furca, tarnen usque recurret.” According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">contr. Ap. ii.</span> 27), the Jewish law punished with death the judge who took a bribe. But Hebrew judges seem practically to have been no better than Oriental judges generally. (See <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm" title="And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.">1Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-10.htm" title="In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.">Psalm 26:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm" title="A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm" title="Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="/context/micah/3-9.htm" title="Hear this, I pray you, you heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.">Micah 3:9-11</a>, &c.) The corrupt Administration of justice was one of the crying evils which provoked God’s judgments against His people, and led, in the first instance, to the Babylonian captivity, and afterwards to the Roman conquest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/23-8.htm" title="And you shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.">Exodus 23:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt take no gift </span>— From those whose causes are depending before thee; because, if thou dost not sell justice for it, thou wilt both seem and be tempted to do so. <span class="ital">The gift blindeth the wise </span>— Bribes and interest cast a mist before the eyes, and bias the judgment and affections even of those who are otherwise wise and discerning.

A doubtful case was rather to be left to God Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. <a href="/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>.<p>(c) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert judgment <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; compare <a href="/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>.<p>(d) To vindicate the rights of the stranger <a href="/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> - rather, the foreigner.

The worst sin of a judge, and the commonest in the East, is to accept abribe from one of the parties to a suit, and give sentence accordingly. As such a practice defeats the whole end for which the administration of justice exists, it is, when detected, for the most part, punished capitally. Josephus tells us that it was so among the Jews (<span class="accented">Contr. Apion</span>. 2:27); but the Mosaic code, as it has come down to us, omits to fix the penalty. Whatever it was, it was practically set at nought. Eli's sons "turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment" (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). In David's time, men's hands were "full of bribes" (<a href="/psalms/26-10.htm">Psalm 26:10</a>). Solomon complains of wicked men" taking gifts out of their bosoms to pervert the ways of judgment" (<a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). Isaiah is never weary of bearing witness against the princes of his day, who" love gifts and follow after rewards" (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>);who "justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him" (<a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>). Micah adds his testimony  - "Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob and princes of the house of Israel, that <span class="accented">abhor judgment and pervert all equity</span>. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward" (<a href="/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The gift blindeth the wise</span>.

But, on the other hand, "neither shalt thou adorn the poor man in his dispute" (<a href="/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>), i.e., show partiality to the poor or weak man in an unjust cause, out of weak compassion for him. (Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, a passage which, notwithstanding the fact that &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; is applied to favour shown to the great or mighty, overthrows Knobel's conjecture, that &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; should be read for &#1493;&#1491;&#1500;, inasmuch as it prohibits the showing of favour to the one as much as to the other.)</body></html>
