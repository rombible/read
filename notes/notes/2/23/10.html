It is most extraordinary that any legislator should have been able to induce a people to accept such a law. <span class= "ital">Prima facie, </span>it seemed, by forbidding productive industry during one year in seven, to diminish the wealth of the nation by one-seventh. But it is questionable whether, under a primitive agricultural system, when rotation of crops was unknown, the lying of the land fallow during one year in seven would not have been an economical benefit. There was no prohibition on labour other than in cultivation. The clearing away of weeds and thorns and stones was allowed, and may have been practised. After an early harvest of the self-sown crop, the greater part of the year may have been spent in this kind of industry. Still the enactment was no doubt unpopular: it checked the regular course of agriculture, and seemed to rob landowners of one-seventh of their natural gains. Accordingly, we find that it was very irregularly observed. Between the Exodus and the Captivity it had apparently been neglected seventy times (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2Chronicles 36:21</a>), or more often than it had been kept. After the Captivity, however, the observance became regular, and classical writers notice the custom as one existing in their day (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist. v.</span> 4). Julius Cæsar permitted it, and excused the Jews from paying tribute in the seventh year on its account (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant Jud. </span>xiv. 10, § 6). The object of the law was threefold—(1) to test obedience; (2) to give an advantage to the poor and needy, to whom the crop of the seventh year belonged (<a href="/exodus/23-11.htm" title="But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your olive grove.">Exodus 23:11</a>); and (3) to allow an opportunity, once in seven years, for prolonged communion with God and increased religious observances. (See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/exodus/23-10.htm" title="And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:...">Exodus 23:10-11</a></span>. The institution of the sabbatical year was designed, 1st, To show what a plentiful land that was into which God was bringing them, that so numerous a people could have rich maintenance out of the products of so small a country, without foreign trade, and yet could spare the increase of every seventh year. 2d, To teach them confidence in his care and bounty while they did their duty; that as the sixth day’s manna served for two days’ meat, so the sixth year’s increase should serve for two years’ subsistence. 3d, Thus he would try and secure their obedience, keep them in dependance upon himself, and give to them and all their neighbours a manifest proof of his singular and gracious providence over them. 4th, By this kind of quit rent they were likewise admonished that God alone was the Lord of the land, and that they were only tenants at his will. And being thus freed from their great labours in cultivating the ground, in manuring, ploughing, sowing, weeding, reaping, they were the more at leisure to meditate on God’s works, and to acquaint themselves with his will. 5th, Another reason also is given here, <span class="ital">That the poor of thy land may eat. </span>God gave a special blessing to the sixth year, whereby it brought forth the fruit of three years; and in years of so great plenty, men are generally more negligent in their reaping, and therefore, the relics are more. So that in this appointment God had in view a more comfortable provision for the poor. It was likewise a curb to avarice, and habituated them to the exercise of humanity to their slaves, and even beasts. <span class="ital">In like manner with thy vineyard and olive-yard — </span>Thou shalt not prune nor dress them, nor gather and appropriate to thy own use what they shall produce, but shalt leave them to the poor.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the first mention of the Sabbatical year; the law for it is given at length in <a href="/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2</a>. Both the Sabbatical year and the weekly Sabbath are here spoken of exclusively in their relation to the poor, as bearing testimony to the equality of the people in their covenant with Yahweh. In the first of these institutions, the proprietor of the soil gave up his rights for the year to the whole community of living creatures, not excepting the beasts: in the latter, the master gave up his claim for the day to the services of his servants and cattle.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. six years thou shalt sow thy land&#8212;intermitting the cultivation of the land every seventh year. But it appears that even then there was a spontaneous produce which the poor were permitted freely to gather for their use, and the beasts driven out fed on the remainder, the owners of fields not being allowed to reap or collect the fruits of the vineyard or oliveyard during the course of this sabbatical year. This was a regulation subservient to many excellent purposes; for, besides inculcating the general lesson of dependence on Providence, and of confidence in His faithfulness to His promise respecting the triple increase on the sixth year (Le 25:20, 21), it gave the Israelites a practical proof that they held their properties of the Lord as His tenants, and must conform to His rules on pain of forfeiting the lease of them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And six years thou shall sow thy land, The land of Canaan, given to their ancestors and to them, and which they were now going to inherit; and when they came into it they were to plant it with vines and olives; or rather, these being ready planted, they were to prune and dress them; and they were to till their land, and plough it, and sow it with various sorts of grain, for six years running, from the time of their possession of it: <p>and shall gather in the fruits thereof; corn and wine, and oil, into their own garners, treasuries, and cellars, as their own property, to dispose of as they pleased for their own use and profit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10, 11</span>. The fallow year. In every seventh year the fields, vineyards, and olive-gardens are to remain uncultivated, such produce as they bear naturally being not gathered by the owners, but left to the poor. The terms in which the law is expressed leave it uncertain whether (as is generally supposed) a year common to the whole land is intended, or (Riehm, <span class="ital">HWB.</span> s.v. Sabbathjahr; Wellh. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> p. 117 f.; Nowack, <span class="ital">Archäol.</span> ii. 162; W. R.

In <a href="/context/leviticus/25-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,...">Leviticus 25:1-7</a> (H) it is represented as a fixed year to be observed throughout the country simultaneously; but this does not determine the question whether it had that character from the beginning. A common septennial fallow year, must, in practice, have had its inconveniences: <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> (cf. <a href="/context/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths....">Leviticus 26:34-35</a>) seems to imply that it was not observed, at least regularly, before the exile: but there are several notices of its observance in the Greek period (e.g. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-49.htm" title="But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.">1Ma 6:49</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-53.htm" title="Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)">1Ma 6:53</a> : <span class="ital">DB.</span> iv. 325b).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–12</span>. The seventh year to be a fallow year, and the seventh day to be a day of rest. The motive, it may be noticed, is in each case a philanthropic one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of the Sabbatical year</span>. Days of rest, at regular or irregular intervals, were well known to the ancients and some  regulations of the kind existed in most countries But entire years of rest were wholly unknown to any nation except the Israelites. and exposed them to the reproach of idleness. (See Tacit. <span class="accented">Hist</span>. 5:4: - "Septimo die otium placuisse ferunt, quia is finem laborum dedit; dein, <span class="accented">blandiente inertia</span>, septimum quoque annum ignaviae datum"). In a primitive condition of agriculture, when rotation of crops was unknown, artificial manure unemployed, and the need of letting even the best land sometimes lie fallow unrecognised, it may not have been an uneconomical arrangement to require an entire suspension of cultivation once in seven years. But great difficulty was probably experienced in enforcing the law. Just as there were persons who wished to gather manna on the seventh day (<a href="/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>), so there would be many anxious to obtain in the seventh year something more from their fields than Nature would give them if left to herself. If the "seventy years" of the captivity were intended exactly to make up for omissions of the due observance of the sabbatical year, we must suppose that between the time of the exodus and the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the ordinance had been as often neglected as observed. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>.) The primary object of the requirement was, as stated in ver. 11, <span class="cmt_word">that the poor of thy people may eat</span>, what the land brought forth of its own accord in the Sabbatical year being shared by them (<a href="/leviticus/25-6.htm">Leviticus 25:6</a>.). But no doubt it was also intended that the Sabbatical year should be one of increased religious observance, whereof the solemn reading of the law in the ears of the people at the Feast of Tabernacles "in the year of release" (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>) was an indication and a part. That reading was properly preceded by a time of religious preparation (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-15</a>), and would naturally lead on to further acts of a religious character, which might occupy a considerable period (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> chs. 9. and 10.). Altogether, the year was a most solemn period, calling men to religious self-examination, to repentance, to the formation of holy habits, and tending to a general elevation among the people of the standard of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">What they leave the beasts of the field shall eat</span>. There was to be no regular ingathering. The proprietor, his servants, the poor, and the stranger were to take what they needed; and the residue was to be for the cattle and for the beasts that were in the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy vineyard - thy oliveyard</span>. Corn, wine, and oil were the only important products of Palestine; and this mention of the vineyard and the oliveyard shows that one and the same law was to hold good of all the lands in the country, however they might be cultivated. The whole land was to rest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Not only was their conduct not to be determined by public opinion, the direction taken by the multitude, or by weak compassion for a poor man; but personal antipathy, enmity, and hatred were not to lead them to injustice or churlish behaviour. On the contrary, if the Israelite saw his enemy's beast straying, he was to bring it back again; and if he saw it lying down under the weight of its burden, he was to help it up again (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-4</a>). The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489; &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;, "cease (desist) to leave it to him (thine enemy); thou shalt loosen it (let it loose) with him," which have been so variously explained, cannot have any other signification than this: "beware of leaving an ass which has sunk down beneath its burden in a helpless condition, even to thine enemy, to try whether he can help it up alone; rather help him to set it loose from its burden, that it may get up again." This is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-4.htm">Deuteronomy 22:4</a>, where &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488;, "withdraw not thyself," is substituted for &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489; &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;, and &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1501;, "set up with him," for &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;. From this it is obvious that &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; is used in the first instance in the sense of leaving it alone, leaving it in a helpless condition, and immediately afterwards in the sense of undoing or letting loose. The peculiar turn given to the expression, "thou shalt cease from leaving," is chosen because the ordinary course, which the natural man adopts, is to leave an enemy to take care of his own affairs, without troubling about either him or his difficulties. Such conduct as this the Israelite was to give up, if he ever found his enemy in need of help.</body></html>
