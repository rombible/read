They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The blood of my sacrifice - It is generally considered that this must refer to the Paschal Lamb.

All the males were enjoined to repair to the tabernacle and afterwards the temple, and the women frequently went. The institution of this national custom was of the greatest importance in many ways: by keeping up a national sense of religion and a public uniformity in worship, by creating a bond of unity, and also by promoting internal commerce among the people. Though the absence of all the males at these three festivals left the country defenseless, a special promise was given of divine protection, and no incursion of enemies was ever permitted to happen on those occasions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These clauses most understand of the passover, by comparing this place with its parallel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/34-25.htm" title="You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left to the morning.">Exodus 34:25</a></span>, where the passover is mentioned.

In a more advanced stage of society the bread was made in this way only in cases of emergency (<a href="/genesis/19-3.htm" title="And he pressed on them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.">Genesis 19:3</a>), or for purposes of ritual. The ordinary bread of the Hebrews was made lighter by fermentation’ (Kennedy, in <span class="ital">EB.</span> i. 604). The reason why leavened bread was prohibited for ritual purposes was, probably, partly because unleavened bread had the sanction of antiquity (Kennedy, <span class="ital">ib.</span> iii. 2753), partly because leaven, being produced by fermentation, was regarded as tainted with a species of corruption (<span class="ital">ib.</span> p. 2754; <span class="ital">OTJC.</span>2[194] p. 345; <span class="ital">Rel.

On the contrary, as they are separated from these by <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>, they are to be reckoned as forming part of the laws relating to their mutual obligations one towards another. This is evident from the fact, that in both of them the care of the poor stands in the foreground. From this characteristic and design, which are common to both, we may explain the fact, that there is no allusion to the keeping of a Sabbath unto the Lord, as in <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2</a>, in connection with either the seventh year or seventh day: all that is mentioned being their sowing and reaping for six years, and working for six days, and then letting the land lie fallow in the seventh year, and their ceasing or resting from labour on the seventh day. "The seventh year thou shalt let (thy land) loose (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496; to leave unemployed), and let it lie; and the poor of thy people shall eat (the produce which grows of itself), and their remainder (what they leave) shall the beast of the field eat." &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;: lit., to breathe one's self, to draw breath, i.e., to refresh one's self (cf. <a href="/exodus/31-17.htm">Exodus 31:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-14.htm">2 Samuel 16:14</a>). - With <a href="/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a> the laws relating to the rights of the people, in their relations to one another, are concluded with the formula enforcing their observance, "And in all that I say to you, take heed," viz., that ye carefully maintain all the rights which I have given you. There is then attached to this, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14</a>, a warning, which forms the transition to the relation of Israel to Jehovah: "Make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth." This forms a very fitting boundary line between the two series of mishpatim, inasmuch as the observance and maintenance of both of them depended upon the attitude in which Israel stood towards Jehovah. </body></html>
