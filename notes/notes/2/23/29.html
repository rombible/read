The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beast of the field - i. e. destructive animals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29, 30. I will not drive &#8230; out &#8230; in one year; lest the land become desolate&#8212;Many reasons recommend a gradual extirpation of the former inhabitants of Canaan.

The expulsion of the Canaanites will however be gradual: it will not be completed till the Israelites are numerous enough to fill effectually the territory vacated by them. Hence, with verbal variations, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm" title="And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase on you.">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>. The representation is in striking contrast to the idealized pictures of rapid conquests drawn in the Deuteronomic sections of the book of Joshua, from which the popular conception of the ‘extermination of the Canaanites’ is derived (e.g. <a href="/context/joshua/10-28.htm" title="And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho....">Joshua 10:28-43</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/11-16.htm" title="So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;...">Joshua 11:16-23</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/21-43.htm" title="And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelled therein....">Joshua 21:43-45</a>); but it agrees with the accounts given in the older strata of Joshua and Judges, according to which there were many districts from which the Israelites were unable to expel the Canaanites, and the country as a whole was only occupied by them gradually (<a href="/joshua/13-13.htm" title="Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.">Joshua 13:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-63.htm" title="As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm" title="And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries....">Joshua 17:11-18</a>, <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>; <a href="/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Jdg 1:21</a>; <a href="/context/judges/1-27.htm" title="Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land....">Jdg 1:27-35</a>; <a href="/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jdg 1:9</a>). The historical reason why the Canaanites thus remained so long in many parts of the land was because the Israelites had not the military resources enabling them to cope with them (cf. <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>); but the fact nevertheless remained one which many religiously-minded Israelites found it difficult to reconcile with their sense of Jehovah’s sovereignty; and different moral, or religious, theories were framed to account for it. Here it is explained as due to Jehovah’s care that unoccupied spots should not be left in the land, on which wild beasts might multiply and become a danger to the Israelites (<a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm" title="And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.">2 Kings 17:25</a> f.; cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm" title="If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:">Ezekiel 14:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?">Ezekiel 14:21</a>): for other theories, see <a href="/judges/2-20.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;">Jdg 2:20</a> to <a href="/judges/3-4.htm" title="And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.">Jdg 3:4</a> (comp. <span class="ital">LOT.</span>8 p. 165 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">31a.</span> Israel’s territory will reach, beyond Canaan itself, from the Red Sea to the ‘sea of the Philistines’ (i.e. the SE. coast of the Medit.

Warnings against holding intercourse with the Canaanites, and commands to overthrow their altars, &c.

Even in France, after the Franco-German war, it was found that in many districts wolves increased. A third reason why the nations were not subdued all at once, not mentioned here, is touched in <a href="/judges/2-21.htm">Judges 2:21-23</a> - "The Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily, that through them he might prove Israel, whether they would keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, or not." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Relation of Jehovah to Israel. - The declaration of the rights conferred by Jehovah upon His people is closed by promises, through which, on the one hand, God insured to the nation the gifts and benefits involved in their rights, and, on the other hand, sought to promote that willingness and love which were indispensable to the fulfilment of the duties incumbent upon every individual in consequence of the rights conferred upon them. These promises secured to the people not only the protection and help of God during their journey through the desert, and in the conquest of Canaan, but also preservation and prosperity when they had taken possession of the land.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-27</a><p>Jehovah would send an angel before them, who should guard them on the way from injury and destruction, and bring them to the place prepared for them, i.e., to Canaan. The name of Jehovah was in this angel (<a href="/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), that is to say, Jehovah revealed Himself in him; and hence he is called in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>, the face of Jehovah, because the essential nature of Jehovah was manifested in him. This angel was not a created spirit, therefore, but the manifestation of Jehovah Himself, who went before them in the pillar of cloud and fire, to guide and to defend them (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). But because it was Jehovah who was guiding His people in the person of the angel, He demanded unconditional obedience (<a href="/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), and if they provoked Him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, see <a href="/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) by disobedience, He would not pardon their transgression; but if they followed Him and hearkened to His voice, He would be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries (<a href="/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>). And when the angel of the Lord had brought them to the Canaanites and exterminated the latter, Israel was still to yield the same obedience, by not serving the gods of the Canaanites, or doing after their works, i.e., by not making any idolatrous images, but destroying them (these works), and smiting to pieces the pillars of their idolatrous worship (&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1514; does not mean statues erected as idols, but memorial stones or columns dedicated to idols: see my Comm. on <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), and serving Jehovah alone. Then would He bless them in the land with bountiful provision, health, fruitfulness, and length of life (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23-26</a>). "Bread and water" are named, as being the provisions which are indispensable to the maintenance of life, as in <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>. The taking away of "sickness" (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>) implied the removal of everything that could endanger life. The absence of anything that miscarried, or was barren, insured the continuance and increase of the nation; and the promise that their days should be fulfilled, i.e., that they should not be liable to a premature death (cf. <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), was a pledge of their well-being.</body></html>
