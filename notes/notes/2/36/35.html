Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Where have we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by love dwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? Mt 1:23. This is the sum of the ministry of reconciliation, 2Co 5:18,19. This was the design of the tabernacle of witness, a visible testimony of the love of God to the race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. <p>See the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. <p>For <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-9.htm">Exodus 38:9-20</a> see the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. he made a veil of blue&#8212;the second or inner veil, which separated the holy from the most holy place, embroidered with cherubim and of great size and thickness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, the second veil, which separated between the holy place and the holy of holies, because the first veil is described <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/36-37.htm" title="And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;">Exodus 36:37</a></span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle,....
