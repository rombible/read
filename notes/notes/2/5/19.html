See what need we have to pray that we may be delivered from wicked men. The head-workmen justly complained to Pharaoh: but he taunted them. The malice of Satan has often represented the service and worship of God, as fit employment only for those who have nothing else to do, and the business only of the idle; whereas, it is the duty of those who are most busy in the world. Those who are diligent in doing sacrifice to the Lord, will, before God, escape the doom of the slothful servant, though with men they do not. The Israelites should have humbled themselves before God, and have taken to themselves the shame of their sin; but instead of that, they quarrel with those who were to be their deliverers. Moses returned to the Lord. He knew that what he had said and done, was by God's direction; and therefore appeals to him. When we find ourselves at any time perplexed in the way of our duty, we ought to go to God, and lay open our case before him by fervent prayer. Disappointments in our work must not drive us from our God, but still we must ponder why they are sent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are idle - The old Egyptian language abounds in epithets which show contempt for idleness. The charge was equally offensive and ingenious; one which would be readily believed by Egyptians who knew how much public and private labors were impeded by festivals and other religious ceremonies. Among the great sins which, according to Egyptian belief, involved condemnation in the final judgment, idleness is twice mentioned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-19. And the taskmasters hasted them &#8230; officers &#8230; beaten&#8212;As the nearest fields were bared and the people had to go farther for stubble, it was impossible for them to meet the demand by the usual tale of bricks. "The beating of the officers is just what might have been expected from an Eastern tyrant, especially in the valley of the Nile, as it appears from the monuments, that ancient Egypt, like modern China, was principally governed by the stick" [Taylor]. "The mode of beating was by the offender being laid flat on the ground and generally held by the hands and feet while the chastisement was administered" [Wilkinson]. (De 25:2). A picture representing the Hebrews on a brick field, exactly as described in this chapter, was found in an Egyptian tomb at Thebes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Did see that they were in evil case, </span> or, <span class="ital">looked upon them with sadness</span>, or <span class="ital">with an evil eye</span>, i.e. with a sorrowful and angry countenance, as those that could obtain no relaxation for themselves or for their brethren. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case,....

The accompanying illustration (given more completely in Wilk.-B. i. 344) from the tomb of Rekhmâra, vizier of Thothmes III (1503–1449 b.c.), at ‘Abd el-Ḳurnah, opposite to Luxor, represents Asiatic captives making bricks for the temple of Amon at Thebes. On the left we see men drawing water from a tank to moisten the mud: elsewhere there are men carrying the mud in baskets, kneading it with their feet, placing it in moulds (which would usually be stamped with the name of the reigning king), exposing the bricks to dry, piling them up in rows, and building a wall with them; in the lower picture we notice an Egyptian ‘taskmaster’ with hid rod. The gangs of slaves, or captives, engaged upon such work, were organized almost like an army: they were under the superintendence of ‘standard-bearers,’ chosen out of the Egyptian army (corresponding to the ‘taskmasters’ here), and they had also officers of their own (corresponding to the <span class="ital">shôṭerim</span>), who were responsible to the standard-bearers. See Erman, pp. 417 f., 128. At Tell el-Maskhuta, the site of Pithom (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.">Exodus 1:11</a>), M. Naville found bricks, some made with chopped straw or reed, and some without it (<span class="ital">Pithom</span>, p. 11b). Most Egyptian bricks, however, do not contain straw; and Petrie (<span class="ital">Egypt and Israel</span>, 30) think that the straw here asked for was for dipping the hand in, or sprinkling over the still soft bricks, that they might not stick.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The officers... did see that they were in evil case</span>.
