In the act of solemn worship, they perceived that He was present with them, as their Lord and their Deliverer. It is idle to speculate on the mode of this revelation. That no visible form was presented to their bodily eyes, we are expressly informed, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>; see <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; compare <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>.

And they saw the God of Israel&#8212;That there was no visible form or representation of the divine nature, we have expressly intimated (De 4:15). But a symbol or emblem of His glory was distinctly, and at a distance, displayed before those chosen witnesses. Many think, however, that in this private scene was discovered, amid the luminous blaze, the faint adumbrated form of the humanity of Christ (Eze 1:26; compare Ga 3:24).<p>sapphire&#8212;one of the most valuable and lustrous of the precious gems&#8212;of a sky-blue or light azure color and frequently chosen to describe the throne of God (see Eze 1:26; 10:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They saw the God of Israel; </span> not any visible resemblance of the Divine nature, which is expressly denied, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/4-15.htm" title="Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:">Deu 4:15</a> <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting.

The Targum of Jonathan restrains this to Nadab and Abihu whereas it is doubtless true of Moses and Aaron, and the seventy elders, who all saw him, and who were witnesses to the people that it was a divine Person that spoke to Moses, and delivered the laws unto him, to be observed by them; which seems to be the reason of their being called up, and favoured with this sight which must not be understood as of anything criminal in them, as if they curiously looked and pried to see something they should not, for which they deserved some sort of punishment, as the Targum intimates; but of a privilege, and a very high one they were favoured with: and this sight they had was not by a vision of prophecy, or with the eyes of their understanding, but corporeally; they saw the Son of God, the God of Israel, in an human form, as a pledge and presage of his future incarnation, who is the Angel that spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, as Stephen says, and the Lord that was among the angels there, who afterwards became incarnate, and having done his work on earth, ascended on high, <a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>. <p>and there was under his feet; which shows that there was a visible form, and that human; nor is this contrary to what is said, "ye saw no similitude"; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>, since what is here related does not respect the same time, nor the same persons; this was after the giving of the ten commands, that at the time of it; this is said of the seventy elders, with Moses, Aaron, and his two sons, that of all the people: <p>as it were paved work of a sapphire stone: like a pavement pitched with sapphire. The Septuagint version is,"and they saw the place where the God of Israel stood, and what were under his feet, as the work of a sapphire brick.''The sapphire stones, of which the pavement was, were as broad as bricks, and being like a brick, was a memorial, as the Targum of Jonathan says, of the servitude the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with in clay and bricks; but being a sapphire, bright and glorious, may denote the liberty they now enjoyed in exchange for their bondage. And the Targum of Jonathan understands it of the colour, and not of the form of the sapphire, and renders it, the white sapphire; and so do some Jewish writers (w); though the colour of the sapphire is azure, or sky coloured, with which agrees what follows: <p>and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness; and Ruaeus (x) says, the sapphire is sky coloured, and some of them shine and sparkle with golden points or spots, and are reckoned the best sapphires; so that this represents the heaven as quite clear and serene, bespangled with stars; and as the heavens, covered with clouds, may denote the displeasure of God, so a serene heaven his favour and good will, and in such an amiable light was he now beheld. <p>(w) Saadiah Gaon in Aben Ezra, &amp; R.

Cf. the sapphire throne upon which, in his vision, Ezekiel sees the Divine form (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>).

These words can scarcely mean less than that they saw with their bodily eyes some appearance of the Divine being who had summoned them to his presence for the purpose. Moses, we know, saw a "similitude of God" (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). Isaiah "saw the Lord sitting upon his throne "(<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). Ezekiel saw upon the throne "the appearance of a man" (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). It does not follow from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12, 15</a>, that <span class="accented">the elders</span> saw no similitude, since in that passage Moses is speaking, not to the elders, but to the people, and referring, not to what occurred at the sacrificial feast after the ratification of the covenant, but to the scene at the giving of the Ten Commandments previously (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-18</a>). What the form was which the elders saw, we are not told; but as it had "feet," it was probably a human form. It may have been hazy, indefinite, "too dazzling bright for mortal eye" to rest upon. But it was a true "vision of God"  - and, as Keil says, "a foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity." <span class="cmt_word">There was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone.</span> Rather, "and under his feet was, as it were, a work of clear sapphire." Nothing is said concerning a pavement, but only that below the feet of the figure which they saw was something, which looked as if it were made of bright blue sapphire stone, something as clear and as blue as the blue of heaven. Canon Cook  supposes the actual sky to be meant; but the expression, "<span class="accented">as it were</span>, the body of heaven," or "like the very heaven," makes this impossible. A thing is not like itself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The ceremony described in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-11</a> is called "the covenant which Jehovah made with Israel" (<a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>). It was opened by Moses, who recited to the people "all the words of Jehovah" (i.e., not the decalogue, for the people had heard this directly from the mouth of God Himself, but the words in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22-26</a>), and "all the rights" (ch. 21-23); whereupon the people answered unanimously (&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;), "All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do." This constituted the preparation for the conclusion of the covenant. It was necessary that the people should not only know what the Lord imposed upon them in the covenant about to be made with them, and what He promised them, but that they should also declare their willingness to perform what was imposed upon them. The covenant itself was commenced by Moses writing all the words of Jehovah in "the book of the covenant" (<a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a> and <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>), for the purpose of preserving them in an official record. The next day, early in the morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and erected twelve boundary-stones or pillars for the twelve tribes, most likely round about the altar and at some distance from it, so as to prepare the soil upon which Jehovah was about to enter into union with the twelve tribes. As the altar indicated the presence of Jehovah, being the place where the Lord would come to His people to bless them (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>), so the twelve pillars, or boundary-stones, did not serve as mere memorials of the conclusion of the covenant, but were to indicate the place of the twelve tribes, and represent their presence also. </body></html>
