Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness.

Half of the blood was thrown against the altar; the other half (<span class="ital">v.</span> 8) was thrown over the people. Covenants were ratified in different ways: sometimes, for instance, the contracting parties were held to be bound by eating salt together (cf. <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm" title="And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.">Leviticus 2:13</a>, <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm" title="All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.">Numbers 18:19</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>), sometimes by partaking together in a sacrificial meal (<a href="/genesis/31-54.htm" title="Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.">Genesis 31:54</a>; cf. <span class="ital">v.</span> 11 here), in Genesis 15, <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm" title="And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,">Jeremiah 34:18</a> f., by passing between the divided pieces of slaughtered animals; and especially by the use, still prevalent in many parts of the world, of blood, as by each of the parties tasting the other’s blood, or smearing himself with it, or letting it be mingled with his own, &c., or by both jointly dipping their hands in the blood of a slaughtered animal, &c.

So analogously here: Jehovah and the people are symbolically joined together by the sacrificial blood being thrown over the altar (representing Jehovah) and the people; and thus the ‘covenant,’ or agreement, between them is ratified (cf. <a href="/psalms/50-5.htm" title="Gather my saints together to me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.">Psalm 50:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">basons</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">’aggânôth</span>, elsewhere only <a href="/isaiah/22-24.htm" title="And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.">Isaiah 22:24</a>, <a href="/songs/7-3.htm" title="Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.">Song of Solomon 7:3</a>.

The blood, which symbolised the life of the victim, was the essential part of every sacrifice, and was usually poured over the altar, or at any rate sprinkled upon it, as the very crowning act of offering. (See <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>; etc.) On this occasion Moses retained half of the blood, <span class="cmt_word">and put it in basins</span>, for the purpose of so uniting all the people in the sacrifice, and thereby the more solemnly pledging them to the covenant, which the sacrifice at once consecrated and consummated. (See <a href="/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>.)

On the basis of the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, certain grand and prominent points are mentioned, as constituting the boundaries towards both the east and west. On the west the boundary extended from the Red Sea (see <a href="/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) to the sea of the Philistines, or Mediterranean Sea, the south-eastern shore of which was inhabited by the Philistines; and on the east from the desert, i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, the desert of Arabia, to the river (Euphrates). The poetic suffix &#1502;&#1493; affixed to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; answers to the elevated oratorical style. Making a covenant with them and their gods would imply the recognition and toleration of them, and, with the sinful tendencies of Israel, would be inevitably followed by the worship of idols. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a> signifies if; the second, imo, verily, and serves as an energetic introduction to the apodosis. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, a snare (vid., <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>); here a clause of destruction, inasmuch as apostasy from God is invariably followed by punishment (<a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>). </body></html>
