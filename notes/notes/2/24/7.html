Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The book of the covenant - See <a href="/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a> note.

In this book we have the germ of the Holy Scriptures - the first "book" actually mentioned as written in the narrative of the Bible. Genesis may contain other older documents, inserted by Moses, under the sanction of the Holy Spirit, in his compilation. But his own composition, if we except the burst of poesy called forth by the passage of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-18</a>), would seem to have commenced with "the Book of the Covenant." Upon this nucleus the rest of the law was based; and it was to explain and enforce the law that Moses composed the Pentateuch. <span class="cmt_word">In the audience of the people</span>, Literally, "in the ears of the people," which is equally intelligible, and more graphic. <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, etc The people made the same answer as before (ver. 3), adding a general promise of obedience to all that God might command in future. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These two verses form part of the address of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22-23:33</a>; for &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; ("but to Moses He said") cannot be the commencement of a fresh address, which would necessarily require &#1502; &#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>). The turn given to the expression &#1502; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; presupposes that God had already spoken to others, or that what had been said before related not to Moses himself, but to other persons. But this cannot be affirmed of the decalogue, which applied to Moses quite as much as to the entire nation (a sufficient refutation of Knobel's assertion, that these verses are a continuation of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20-25</a>, and are linked on to the decalogue), but only of the address concerning the mishpatim, or "rights," which commences with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>, and, according to <a href="/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>, was intended for the nation, and addressed to it, even though it was through the medium of Moses. What God said to the people as establishing its rights, is here followed by what He said to Moses himself, namely, that he was to go up to Jehovah, along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders. At the same time, it is of course implied that Moses, who had ascended the mountain with Aaron alone (<a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>), was first of all to go down again and repeat to the people the "rights" which God had communicated to him, and only when this had been done, to ascend again with the persons named. According to <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a> and <a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a> (? 9), this is what Moses really did. But Moses alone was to go near to Jehovah: the others were to worship afar off, and the people were not to come up at all. </body></html>
