These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even of the mercy seat - See the margin.

They stretched out their wings, and their faces were turned towards the mercy seat [Ex 25:20], probably in a bowing attitude. The prevailing opinion now is, that those splendid figures were symbolical not of angelic but of earthly and human beings&#8212;the members of the Church of God interested in the dispensation of grace, the redeemed in every age&#8212;and that these hieroglyphic forms symbolized the qualities of the true people of God&#8212;courage, patience, intelligence, and activity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Of one and the same piece of massy gold, out of which the cherubims were made. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end,.... The situation of the cherubim is particularly explained, lest, as Jarchi observes, it should be thought that there were two at both ends of the mercy seat; whereas there were only one at one end, and another at the other, opposite to each other, and both pointing to the mercy seat; which may express the situation and office of the ministers of the word under each dispensation, who are so placed as to derive all their gifts and graces from Christ, and to point him out unto the sons of men as the only way of salvation, the only propitiation for sin, and through whom alone grace and mercy are to be had: <p>even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof; this is not so much intended the more to inculcate and confirm the situation of the cherubim, as more fully to explain the matter of which they were made; for it was "of" or out of the mercy seat that they were made, at the two ends of it; that is, they were made not only of the same kind of metal with that, but out of the same mass or lump of gold that was; a lid of gold being made commensurate to the ark, what remained above that measure, at the ends of it, were beaten and formed into two cherubim. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">of one piece with</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">out of</span>: the same idiom, <span class="ital">vv.</span> 31, 35, <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm" title="And you shall make the horns of it on the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and you shall overlay it with brass.">Exodus 27:2</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-8.htm" title="And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.">Exodus 28:8</a>, <a href="/exodus/30-2.htm" title="A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.">Exodus 30:2</a>.

Round about it they were to construct a golden &#1494;&#1512;, i.e., probably a golden rim, encircling it like an ornamental wreath. They were also to cast four golden rings and fasten them to the four feet (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514; walking feet, feet bent as if for walking) of the ark, two on either side; and to cut four poles of acacia-wood and plate them with gold, and put them through the rings for carrying the ark. The poles were to remain in the rings, without moving from them, i.e., without being drawn out, that the bearers might not touch the ark itself (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). </body></html>
