Hitherto Israel had had no place of worship, no structure dedicated to God. God now brings this state of things to an end, by requiring them to “make him a sanctuary.” In Egypt they had seen structures of vast size and extraordinary magnificence erected in every city for the worship of the Egyptian gods. They are now to have their own structure, their “holy place,” their “house of God.” As, however, they are still in a nomadic condition, without fixed abode, continually shifting their quarters, a building, in the ordinary sense of the word, would have been unsuitable. They must soon have quitted it or have foregone their hopes of Palestine. God therefore devised for them a structure in harmony with their condition—a “tent-temple”—modelled on the ordinary form of the better Oriental tents, but of the best materials and of an unusual size—yet still portable. It is this structure, with its contents and its adjuncts, which forms the main subject of the rest of the book of Exodus, and which is now minutely and elaborately described in six consecutive chapters (Exodus 25-30)<p><span class= "bld">That I may dwell among them.</span>—Compare <a href="/context/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.">Exodus 29:42-46</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-38</a>.

His dwelling with Israel was not purely spiritual. From time to time He manifested Himself sensibly in the Holy of Holies, where He dwelt continually, and might be consulted by the temporal ruler of the nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">A sanctuary — </span>A place of solemn worship; that I may dwell among them.

He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7.

After the gifts which God will accept have been specified, and the spirit in which they are to be offered noted (ver. 2), God proceeds to unfold his purpose, and declare the object for which the gifts are needed. He will have a "sanctuary" constructed for him, an habitation in which he may "dwell." Now, it is certainly possible to conceive of a religion which should admit nothing in the nature of a temple or sanctuary; and there are even writers who tell us that a religion has actually existed without one (Herod. 1:131, Strab. 15. pp, 1039-41) That God should "dwell" in a house, as a man does, is of course impossible; and the Hebrews were as deeply impressed with this truth as any other nation (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>, etc.). But a religion without a temple was probably unknown in the days of Moses; and, with such a people as  the Hebrews, it is inconceivable that religion could have maintained its ground for long without something of the kind. "It was," as Kalisch says, "above all things necessary to create a firm and visible centre of monotheism, to keep perpetually the idea of the one omnipotent God alive in the minds of the people, and so to exclude for ever a relapse into the pagan and idolatrous aberrations" (<span class="accented">Comment on Exodus</span>, p. 365). A sanctuary was therefore to be constructed; but, as the nation was in the peculiar position of being nomadic, without fixed abode, that is, and constantly on the move, the usual form of a permanent building was unsuitable under the circumstances. To meet the difficulty, a tent-temple was designed, which is called <span class="accented">mishkan</span>, "the dwelling," or <span class="accented">ohel</span>, "the tent," which was simply an Oriental tent on a large scale, made of the best obtainable materials, and guarded by an enclosure. The details of the work are reserved for later mention. In the present passage two directions only are given: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A sanctuary is to be constructed; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Both it, and all its vessels, are to be made after patterns which God was about to show to Moses. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A sanctuary</span> well expresses the Hebrew <span class="accented">micdash</span>, which is derived from cadash - "to be holy."
