The representation on the Arch of Titus exactly agrees with this description. It was a peculiarity of the "candlestick," as compared with other candelabra, that all the branches were in the same plane. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Table of Shew-Bread (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>). - The table for the shew-bread (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>) was to be made of acacia-wood, two cubits long, one broad, and one and a half high, and to be plated with pure gold, having a golden wreath round, and a "finish (&#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;) of a hand-breadth round about," i.e., a border of a hand-breadth in depth surrounding and enclosing the four sides, upon which the top of the table was laid, and into the four corners of which the feet of the table were inserted. A golden wreath was to be placed round this rim. As there is no article attached to &#1494;&#1512;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;&#1489; in <a href="/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a> (cf. <a href="/exodus/37-12.htm">Exodus 37:12</a>), so as to connect it with the &#1494;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-24.htm">Exodus 25:24</a>, we must conclude that there were two such ornamental wreaths, one round the slab of the table, the other round the rim which was under the slab. At the four corners of the four feet, near the point at which they joined the rim, four rings were to be fastened for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., to hold the poles with which the table was carried, as in the case of the ark. </body></html>
