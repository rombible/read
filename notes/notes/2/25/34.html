It would seem from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33-35</a> that the ornamentation of the candlestick consisted of uniform members, each comprising a series of an almond flower, a knob and a lily; that the stem comprised four of these members; that each pair of branches was united to the stem at one of the knobs; and that each branch comprised three members.

A golden wreath was to be placed round this rim. As there is no article attached to &#1494;&#1512;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;&#1489; in <a href="/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a> (cf. <a href="/exodus/37-12.htm">Exodus 37:12</a>), so as to connect it with the &#1494;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-24.htm">Exodus 25:24</a>, we must conclude that there were two such ornamental wreaths, one round the slab of the table, the other round the rim which was under the slab. At the four corners of the four feet, near the point at which they joined the rim, four rings were to be fastened for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., to hold the poles with which the table was carried, as in the case of the ark. </body></html>
