He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yahweh had redeemed the Israelites from bondage.

The reason of the difference seems to be this, that the light of reason implanted in all men, gives him greater help in the discovery of moral and judicial things than in ceremonial matters, or in the external way and manner of God’s worship; which is a thing depending wholly upon God’s institution, and not left to man’s invention, which is a very incompetent judge of those things, as appears from hence, because the wittiest men, destitute of God’s revelation, have been guilty of most foolery in their devices of God’s worship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

All liberally-minded Israelites are invited to contribute the materials necessary for the construction and equipment of a sanctuary—its fabric, its sacred vessels, and (ch. 28) the vestments of its priests. The materials are to include metals, textile fabrics, skins, wood, oil, spices, and precious stones. The sanctuary, when completed, is to form an abode in which Jehovah may dwell in the midst of His people (<span class="ital">v.</span> 8).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - THE TABERNACLE AND THE GIFTS FOR IT. The great principles of the moral law had been given in the Ten Commandments uttered by God amid the thunders of Sinai. The "Book of the Covenant," or short summary of the main laws, civil, political, and social, had been communicated to Moses, and by him reduced to a written form (<a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>). A solemn league and covenant had been entered into between God and his people, the people undertaking to keep all the words of the Lord, and God to be their Protector, Guide, and King. But no form of worship had been set up. Abstract monotheism had been inculcated; and worship had been so far touched upon that an "altar" had been mentioned, and certain directions, chiefly negative, had been given with respect to it (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24-26</a>). It remained that the abstract monotheism should be enshrined in forms, obtain a local habitation, and be set forth before the eyes, and so fixed in the heart and affections of the people. God was now about to declare to Moses what the character of the habitation should be, its size, form, and materials. But before doing this, as a first and fitting, if not necessary, preliminary, he required of the people to bring of the best of their possessions for the service which he was about to institute, enumerating the substances which he would condescend to receive at their hands, and especially enjoining upon them that all should be offered willingly and from the heart (ver. 2). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses was preparing to ascend the mountain with his servant Joshua (vid., <a href="/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>), he ordered the elders to remain in the camp (&#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; i.e., where they were) till their return, and appointed Aaron and Hur (vid., <a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>) as administrators of justice in case of any disputes occurring among the people. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; whoever has matters, matters of dispute (on this meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; see <a href="/genesis/37-19.htm">Genesis 37:19</a>).</body></html>
