The Sinaitic acacia (<span class= "ital">A. Seyal</span>) is a “gnarled and thorny tree, somewhat like a solitary hawthorn in its habit and manner of growth, but much larger” (Tristram). At present it does not, in the Sinaitic region, grow to such <span class= "bld">a </span>size as would admit of planks, ten cubits long by one and a half wide, being cut from it; but, according to Canon Tristram (<span class= "ital">Nat.

He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7.

Of these were made a covering for the tent or tabernacle: <p>and badgers' skins, which were for the same use: the Septuagint version calls them hyacinth or blue skins; according to which, they seem to be the rams' skins died blue; and so Josephus (b) seems to have understood it; and it is much questionable whether the same creature is meant we call the badger, since that with the Israelites was an unclean creature; nor is its skin made use of for shoes, or well could be, as the skin of this creature is said to be, <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>.

Several species of acacia are found in Palestine, the Sin. Peninsula, and the Arabian desert (<span class="ital">EB.</span> s.v. Shittah tree): the <span class="ital">Acacia seyâl</span> flourishes in dry wâdys, and grows freely in the Peninsula, and along the W. shore of the Dead Sea: it is a gnarled and thorny tree, some 15–25 feet in height: and its wood is hard, close-grained, and durable (cf. the rend. of LXX. <span class="greekheb">ξύλα ἄσεπτα</span>). According to Doughty (<span class="ital">Arab. Des.</span> ii. 678, cited in <span class="ital">EB.</span> l.c.), another species is used for shipbuilding on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.

The manufacture of leather was well-known in Egypt from an early date, and the Libyan tribes of North Africa were celebrated for their skill in preparing and dyeing the material (Herod. 4:189). Scarlet was one of the colours which they peculiarly affected (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). We must suppose that the skins spoken of had been brought with them by the Israelites cut of Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And badgers' skins</span>. It is generally agreed among moderns that this is a wrong translation. Badgers are found in Palestine, but not either in Egypt or in the wilderness. The Hebrew <span class="accented">takhash</span> is evidently the same word as the Arabic <span class="accented">tukhash</span> or <span class="accented">dukhash</span>, which is applied to marine animals only, as to seals, dolphins, dugongs, and perhaps sharks and dog-fish. "Seals' skins" would perhaps be the best translation.

The seyal wood is "hard and close-grained of an orange colour with a darker heart, well-adapted for cabinet work;" but the tree, as it exists nowadays, could certainly not furnish the planks, ten cubits long by one and a half wide, which were needed for the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a>). The <span class="accented">Serissa</span> might do so, but it is not now found in the wilderness. We are reduced to supposing either that the seyal grew to a larger size anciently than at present, or that the serissa was more widely spread than at the present day. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When he ascended the mountain, upon which the glory of Jehovah dwelt, it was covered for six days with the cloud, and the glory itself appeared to the Israelites in the camp below like devouring fire (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>); and on the seventh day He called Moses into the cloud.
