The church in its infancy was thus taught by shadows of good things to come; but the substance is Christ, and the grace of the gospel. Christ is our great High Priest. When he undertook the work of our redemption, he put on the clothes of service, he arrayed himself with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, girded himself with resolution to go through the undertaking, took charge of all God's spiritual Israel, laid them near his heart, engraved them on the palms of his hands, and presented them to his Father. And he crowned himself with holiness to the Lord, consecrating his whole undertaking to the honour of his Father's holiness. True believers are spiritual priests.

"to work in the midst of blue", &amp;c. from whence is learnt that the thread of gold was twisted in the midst of them (y): and it may be further observed, that after the enumeration of the stones in the breastplate, <a href="/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a> no mention is made of the Urim and Thummim, which seems to confirm the opinion of many, and which is my own, that they are the same with the stones: moreover, in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a>, it may be observed, that what the coats for the common priests were made of is expressed, which is not before, which was linen; expressive of their purity and holiness, and in which they ought always to appear before God and man, and in which apparel they have been imitated among the Heathens: the priests of Hercules are said to be clothed with linen (z), and the Egyptian priests wore only a linen garment (a); hence the priests of Isis, with whom she is represented as surrounded by Juvenal (b), are called by him "grex liniger", and by Martial, "linigeri" (c). <p>(y) Maimon.

The robes consisted of the ephod (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-2.htm">Exodus 39:2-7</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-12</a>), the choshen or breastplate (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8-21</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15-29</a>), the mel or over-coat (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22-26</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-34</a>); the body-coats, turbans, drawers, and girdles, for Aaron and his sons (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27-29</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>, and <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>). The Urim and Thummim are not mentioned (cf. <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The head-dresses of the ordinary priests, which are simply called "bonnets" in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>, are called "goodly bonnets" or "ornamental caps" in <a href="/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a> of this chapter (&#1502;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; an ornament, cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; ornatus fuit). The singular, "girdle," in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, with the definite article, "the girdle," might appear to refer simply to Aaron's girdle, i.e., the girdle of the high priest; but as there is no special description of the girdles of Aaron's sons (the ordinary priests) in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, where they are distinctly mentioned and called by the same name (abnet) as the girdle of Aaron himself, we can only conclude that they were of the same materials and the same form and make as the latter, and that the singular, &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1496;, is used here either in the most general manner, or as a generic noun in a collective sense (see Ges. 109, 1). The last thing mentioned is the diadem upon Aaron's turban (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), so that the order in which the priests' robes are given here is analogous to the position in which the ark of the covenant and the golden altar stand to one another in the directions concerning the sacred things in ch. 25-30. "For just as all the other things are there placed between the holy ark and the golden altar as the two poles, so here all the rest of the priests' robes are included between the shoulder-dress, the principal part of the official robes of the high priest, and the golden frontlet, the inscription upon which rendered it the most striking sign of the dignity of his office" (Baumgarten). </body></html>
