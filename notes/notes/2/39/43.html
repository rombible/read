As the Most High dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col 2:9. The tabernacle was a symbol of every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem of the heavenly temple, Re 21:3.

The result of a careful and minute survey showed that every plank, curtain, altar, and vase had been most accurately made of the form, and in the place designed by the Divine Architect&#8212;and Moses, in accepting it of their hands, thanked God for them, and begged Him to bless them.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Both the people for their liberal contribution, and the workmen for their great care and industry. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses did look upon all the work,....
