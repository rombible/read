By this was set before them, that their lives were preserved through the ransom of the atonement, which in due time was to be made for sin. They were also to consider their lives, thus ransomed from death, as now to be consecrated to the service of God. The parents were not to look upon themselves as having any right in their first-born, till they solemnly presented them to God, and allowed his title to them. That which is, by special mercy, spared to us, should be applied to God's honour; at least, some grateful acknowledgment, in works of piety and charity, should be made. The remembrance of their coming out of Egypt must be kept up every year. The day of Christ's resurrection is to be remembered, for in it we were raised up with Christ out of death's house of bondage. The Scripture tells us not expressly what day of the year Christ rose, but it states particularly what day of the week it was; as the more valuable deliverance, it should be remembered weekly. The Israelites must keep the feast of unleavened bread. Under the gospel, we must not only remember Christ, but observe his holy supper. Do this in remembrance of him. Also care must be taken to teach children the knowledge of God. Here is an old law for catechising. It is of great use to acquaint children betimes with the histories of the Bible. And those who have God's law in their heart should have it in their mouth, and often speak of it, to affect themselves, and to teach others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hebrew writers have generally regarded this as a formal injunction to write the precepts on slips of parchment, and to fasten them on the wrists and forehead; but other commentators are generally agreed that it is to be understood metaphorically. The words appear to be put into the mouths of the parents. They were to keep all the facts of the Passover constantly in mind, and, referring to a custom prevalent ages before Moses in Egypt, to have them present as though they were inscribed on papyrus or parchment fastened on the wrists, or on the face between the eyes. If, as may be inferred from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7-8</a>, Moses adopted this custom, he would take care to warn the people against the Egyptian superstition of amulets. Modern Israelites generally allege this precept as a justification for the use of phylacteries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, &c.&#8212;There is no reason to believe that the Oriental tattooing&#8212;the custom of staining the hands with the powder of Hennah, as Eastern females now do&#8212;is here referred to. Nor is it probable that either this practice or the phylacteries of the Pharisees&#8212;parchment scrolls, which were worn on their wrists and foreheads&#8212;had so early an existence.
