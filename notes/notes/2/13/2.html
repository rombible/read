The extension of the demand to existing beasts was also reasonable, since they too had been spared. God’s further requirement, that henceforth all the future firstborn should also be His, was intended to perpetuate the memory of the recent deliverance, and to help to fix it in the mind of the nation. The substitution of a redemption in the case of unclean beasts was necessitated by the circumstances of the case, since they could not be sacrificed; and the redemption of the firstborn sons naturally followed when the Levitical priesthood was established, and their services were no longer necessary. (See <a href="/context/numbers/3-40.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.">Numbers 3:40-51</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-16.htm" title="And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.">Numbers 18:16</a>.) The Jews still observe the ordinance, so far as the children are concerned, and redeem the son which has “opened the womb” on the thirtieth day after the birth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Sanctify — </span>That is, command all the people to sanctify; <span class="ital">unto me — </span>To my use and service, in a manner I shall hereafter explain; <span class="ital">all the firstborn — </span>That are males, as the command is limited, <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm" title="That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.">Exodus 13:12</a>; <span class="ital">whatsoever openeth the womb — </span>That is, every child which is the firstborn of his mother: so that if a man had many wives, either together or successively, his first child by every one of these was a firstborn, and, if a male, was claimed by the Lord.

By this was set before them, that their lives were preserved through the ransom of the atonement, which in due time was to be made for sin. They were also to consider their lives, thus ransomed from death, as now to be consecrated to the service of God. The parents were not to look upon themselves as having any right in their first-born, till they solemnly presented them to God, and allowed his title to them. That which is, by special mercy, spared to us, should be applied to God's honour; at least, some grateful acknowledgment, in works of piety and charity, should be made. The remembrance of their coming out of Egypt must be kept up every year. The day of Christ's resurrection is to be remembered, for in it we were raised up with Christ out of death's house of bondage. The Scripture tells us not expressly what day of the year Christ rose, but it states particularly what day of the week it was; as the more valuable deliverance, it should be remembered weekly. The Israelites must keep the feast of unleavened bread. Under the gospel, we must not only remember Christ, but observe his holy supper. Do this in remembrance of him. Also care must be taken to teach children the knowledge of God. Here is an old law for catechising. It is of great use to acquaint children betimes with the histories of the Bible. And those who have God's law in their heart should have it in their mouth, and often speak of it, to affect themselves, and to teach others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sanctify unto me - The command is addressed to Moses. It was to declare the will of God that all firstborn were to be consecrated to Him, set apart from all other creatures. The command is expressly based upon the Passover. The firstborn exempt from the destruction became in a new and special sense the exclusive property of the Lord: the firstborn of man as His ministers, the firstborn of cattle as victims. In lieu of the firstborn of men the Levites were devoted to the temple services. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The foundation of this duty rested on the fact that the Israelites, having had their first-born preserved by a distinguishing act of grace from the general destruction that overtook the families of the Egyptians, were bound in token of gratitude to consider them as the Lord's peculiar property (compare Heb 12:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sanctify unto me, </span> to my use and service, in manner as I shall hereafter explain.

If the Passover was still to retain this signification, of course no foreigner could participate in it. This is the first regulation. But as it was by virtue of a divine call, and not through natural descent, that Israel had become the people of Jehovah, and as it was destined in that capacity to be a blessing to all nations, the attitude assumed towards foreigners was not to be an altogether repelling one. Hence the further directions in <a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44</a> : purchased servants, who had been politically incorporated as Israel's property, were to be entirely incorporated by circumcision, so as even to take part in the Passover. But settlers, and servants working for wages, were not to eat of it, for they stood in a purely external relation, which might be any day dissolved. &#1489;&#1468; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, lit., to eat at anything, to take part in the eating (<a href="/leviticus/22-11.htm">Leviticus 22:11</a>). The deeper ground fore this was, that in this meal Israel was to preserve and celebrate its unity and fellowship with Jehovah. This was the meaning of the regulations, which were repeated in <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-47.htm">Exodus 12:47</a> from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-4.htm">Exodus 12:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-9.htm">Exodus 12:9</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>, where they had been already explained. If, therefore, a foreigner living among the Israelites wished to keep the Passover, he was first of all to be spiritually incorporated into the nation of Jehovah by circumcision (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>). &#1508;&#1505; &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;: "And he has made (i.e., made ready) a passover to Jehovah, let every male be circumcised to him (i.e., he himself, and the male members of his house), and then he may draw near (sc., to Jehovah) to keep it." The first &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; denotes the wish or intention to do it, the second, the actual execution of the wish. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, are all indicative of non-Israelites. &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512; was applied quite generally to any foreigner springing from another nation; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512; was a foreigner living for a shorter or longer time in the midst of the Israelites; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, lit., a dweller, settler, was one who settled permanently among the Israelites, without being received into their religious fellowship; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; was the non-Israelite, who worked for an Israelite for wages. </body></html>
