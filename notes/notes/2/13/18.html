The passage seems to dispose altogether of Dr. Brugsch’s theory, that the “Red Sea” of the writer of Exodus was the Lake Serbônis, and that it was not until after this lake was passed that their journey was deflected to the south.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</span>—It is generally agreed that this is a wrong translation. Very few of the Israelites can have possessed suits of armour until after the passage of the Red Sea, when they may have stripped the bodies of the slain Egyptians. Nor has the word used ever the force of “harnessed.” It might mean “with their loins girded,” but such an exposition would deprive the statement made of any force. Loins were always girded in preparation for a journey, and there would be no need to mention the fact. The best explanation is, that the word here means “organised,” “in military order” (Saadia, Gesenius, Lee, Knobel, Cook). It was clearly necessary, to prevent confusion, that a military order should have been adopted, and there are not wanting indications that during the year of contention with Pharaoh such an organisation was introduced and proceeded with. (See <a href="/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-31.htm" title="And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-26.htm" title="These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.">Exodus 6:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm" title="Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:">Exodus 12:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-51.htm" title="And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.">Exodus 12:51</a>.)

Before they entered the lists with their enemies, matters must be settled between them and their God; laws must be given, ordinances instituted, covenants sealed; and for the doing of this it was necessary they should retire into the solitudes of a wilderness, the only closet for such a crowd; the high road would be no proper place for these transactions.

One was only a few days' journey; the other was much further about, through the wilderness, and that was the way in which God chose to lead his people Israel. The Egyptians were to be drowned in the Red sea; the Israelites were to be humbled and proved in the wilderness. God's way is the right way, though it seems about. If we think he leads not his people the nearest way, yet we may be sure he leads them the best way, and so it will appear when we come to our journey's end. The Philistines were powerful enemies; it was needful that the Israelites should be prepared for the wars of Canaan, by passing through the difficulties of the wilderness. Thus God proportions his people's trials to their strength, 1Co 10:13. They went up in good order. They went up in five in a rank, some; in five bands, so others, which it seems rather to their faith and hope, that God would bring them to Canaan, in expectation of which they carried these bones with them while in the desert.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Harnessed - More probably, "marshalled" or "in orderly array."

God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea, &c.&#8212;This wondrous expanse of water is a gulf of the Indian ocean. It was called in Hebrew "the weedy sea," from the forest of marine plants with which it abounds. But the name of the Red Sea is not so easily traced. Some think it was given from its contiguity to the countries of Edom ("red"); others derive it from its coral rocks; while a third class ascribe the origin of the name to an extremely red appearance of the water in some parts, caused by a numberless multitude of very small mollusca. This sea, at its northern extremity, separates into two smaller inlets&#8212;the eastern called anciently the Elanitic gulf, now the gulf of Akaba; and the western the Heroopolite gulf, now the gulf of Suez, which, there can be no doubt, extended much more to the north anciently than it does now. It was toward the latter the Israelites marched.<p>went up harnessed&#8212;that is, girded, equipped for a long journey. (See Ps 105:37). The Margin renders it "five in a rank," meaning obviously five large divisions, under five presiding officers, according to the usages of all caravans; and a spectacle of such a mighty and motley multitude must have presented an imposing appearance, and its orderly progress could have been effected only by the superintending influence of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">armed</span>, or <span class="ital">girt</span> with swords and belts about the fifth rib, as the Hebrew word may imply. But it doth not appear how or whence they should get their arms, nor how the Egyptians would permit so numerous a people to have and to keep arms, especially when they had a long time oppressed and exasperated them, and made them desperate. It is true, some few of them might procure arms, but this word is here used concerning the whole body of them. Others render it <span class="ital">by fives</span>, five and five in a rank, that is, by a usual synecdoche, in military order, not doubtfully and fearfully, but confidently and courageously; not confusedly, as men that steal or run away, but in good order, so as one might not hinder another. Which interpretation is strengthened by comparing <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/1-14.htm" title="Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;">Joshua 1:14</a></span>.

The latter is much more reasonable to suppose, for five in a rank is too small a number for an army of 600,000 men to march in; since allowing the ranks to be but three feet asunder, and a mile to consist of about two thousand yards, the front and rear of the army would be sixty miles distant from each other (p). <p>(m) "accincti", Fagninus, Vatablus, Cartwright; so Onkelos, Aben Ezra.

M. Müller, <span class="ital">EB.</span>, Red Sea). If it is true that there was once a shallow extension of the Gulf of Suez reaching to L.

This law was to come into force when Israel had taken possession of the promised land. Then everything which opened the womb was to be given up to the Lord. &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;: to cause to pass over to Jehovah, to consecrate or give up to Him as a sacrifice (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). In "all that openeth the womb" the first-born of both man and beast are included (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). This general expression is then particularized in three clauses, commencing with &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;: (a) &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; cattle, i.e., oxen, sheep, and goats, as clean domestic animals, but only the males; (b) asses, as the most common of the unclean domestic animals, instead of the whole of these animals, <a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15</a>; (c) the first-born of the children of Israel. The female first-born of man and beast were exempted from consecration. Of the clean animals the first-born male (&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; abbreviated from &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1512; from the Chaldee &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1512; to throw, the dropped young one) was to belong to Jehovah, i.e., to be sacrificed to Him (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-15.htm">Exodus 13:15</a>, and <a href="/numbers/18-17.htm">Numbers 18:17</a>). This law is still further explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>, where it is stated that the sacrificing was not to take place till the eighth day after the birth; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-21.htm">Deuteronomy 15:21-22</a>, it is still further modified by the command, that an animal which had any fault, and was either blind or lame, was not to be sacrificed, but to be slain and eaten at home, like other edible animals. These two rules sprang out of the general instructions concerning the sacrificial animals. The first-born of the ass was to be redeemed with a male lamb or kid (&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as at <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>); and if not redeemed, it was to be killed. &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;: from &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; the nape, to break the neck (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>). The first-born sons of Israel were also to be consecrated to Jehovah as a sacrifice; not indeed in the manner of the heathen, by slaying and burning upon the altar, but by presenting them to the Lord as living sacrifices, devoting all their powers of body and mind to His service. Inasmuch as the first birth represented all the births, the whole nation was to consecrate itself to Jehovah, and present itself as a priestly nation in the consecration of the first-born. But since this consecration had its foundation, not in nature, but in the grace of its call, the sanctification of the first birth cannot be deduced from the separation of the first-born to the priesthood. This view, which was very prevalent among early writers, has been thoroughly overthrown by Outram (de Sacrif. 1, c. 4) and Vitringa (observv. ii. c. 2, pp. 272ff.). As the priestly character of the nation did not give a title in itself to the administration of the priesthood within the theocracy, so the first-born were not eo ipso chosen as priests through their consecration to Jehovah. In what way they were to consecrate their life to the Lord, depended upon the appointment of the Lord, which was, that they were to perform the non-priestly work of the sanctuary, to be servants of the priests in their holy service. Even this work was afterwards transferred to the Levites (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a>). At the same time the obligation was imposed upon the people to redeem their first-born sons from the service which was binding upon them, but was now transferred to the Levites, who were substituted for them; in other words, to pay five shekels of silver per head to the priesthood (<a href="/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>). In anticipation of this arrangement, which was to be introduced afterwards, the redemption (&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;) of the male first-born is already established here. - On <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>, see <a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;: to-morrow, for the future generally, as in <a href="/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;: what does this mean? quid sibi vult hoc praeceptum ac primogenitura (Jonathan).</body></html>
