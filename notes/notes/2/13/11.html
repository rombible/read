Our souls are forfeited to God's justice, and unless ransomed by the sacrifice of Christ, will certainly perish. These institutions would continually remind them of their duty, to love and serve the Lord. In like manner, baptism and the Lord's supper, if explained and attended to, would remind us, and give us occasion to remind one another of our profession and duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hebrew writers have generally regarded this as a formal injunction to write the precepts on slips of parchment, and to fasten them on the wrists and forehead; but other commentators are generally agreed that it is to be understood metaphorically. The words appear to be put into the mouths of the parents. They were to keep all the facts of the Passover constantly in mind, and, referring to a custom prevalent ages before Moses in Egypt, to have them present as though they were inscribed on papyrus or parchment fastened on the wrists, or on the face between the eyes. If, as may be inferred from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7-8</a>, Moses adopted this custom, he would take care to warn the people against the Egyptian superstition of amulets. Modern Israelites generally allege this precept as a justification for the use of phylacteries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 13:11-16.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, Egypt is called a "slave-house," inasmuch as Israel was employed in slave-labour there, and treated as a slave population (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, etc.). &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1494;&#1511; "strength of hand," in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a>, is more emphatic than the more usual &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>, etc.). - On <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>, see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, and <a href="/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-6.htm">Exodus 13:6</a>, the term "feast to Jehovah" points to the keeping of the seventh day by a holy convocation and the suspension of work (<a href="/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>). It is only of the seventh day that this is expressly stated, because it was understood as a matter of course, that the first was a feast of Jehovah.</body></html>
