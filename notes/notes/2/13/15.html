Our souls are forfeited to God's justice, and unless ransomed by the sacrifice of Christ, will certainly perish. These institutions would continually remind them of their duty, to love and serve the Lord. In like manner, baptism and the Lord's supper, if explained and attended to, would remind us, and give us occasion to remind one another of our profession and duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An ass - The ass could not be offered in sacrifice, being an unclean animal: possibly the only unclean animal domesticated among the Israelites at the time of the Exodus.

These words presuppose the custom of wearing mnemonic signs upon the hand and forehead; but they are not to be traced to the heathen custom of branding soldiers and slaves with marks upon the hand and forehead. For the parallel passages in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>, "bind them for a sign upon your hand," are proofs that the allusion is neither to branding nor writing on the hand. Hence the sign upon the hand probably consisted of a bracelet round the wrist, and the ziccaron between the eyes, of a band worn upon the forehead. The words are then used figuratively, as a proverbial expression employed to give emphasis to the injunction to bear this precept continually in mind, to be always mindful to observe it. This is still more apparent from the reason assigned, "that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth." For it was not by mnemonic slips upon the hand and forehead that a law was so placed in the mouth as to be talked of continually (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>), but by the reception of it into the heart and its continual fulfilment. (See also <a href="/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a>.) As the origin and meaning of the festival were to be talked of in connection with the eating of unleavened bread, so conversation about the law of Jehovah was introduced at the same time, and the obligation to keep it renewed and brought vividly to mind.</body></html>
