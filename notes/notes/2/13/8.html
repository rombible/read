By this was set before them, that their lives were preserved through the ransom of the atonement, which in due time was to be made for sin. They were also to consider their lives, thus ransomed from death, as now to be consecrated to the service of God. The parents were not to look upon themselves as having any right in their first-born, till they solemnly presented them to God, and allowed his title to them. That which is, by special mercy, spared to us, should be applied to God's honour; at least, some grateful acknowledgment, in works of piety and charity, should be made. The remembrance of their coming out of Egypt must be kept up every year. The day of Christ's resurrection is to be remembered, for in it we were raised up with Christ out of death's house of bondage. The Scripture tells us not expressly what day of the year Christ rose, but it states particularly what day of the week it was; as the more valuable deliverance, it should be remembered weekly. The Israelites must keep the feast of unleavened bread. Under the gospel, we must not only remember Christ, but observe his holy supper. Do this in remembrance of him. Also care must be taken to teach children the knowledge of God. Here is an old law for catechising. It is of great use to acquaint children betimes with the histories of the Bible. And those who have God's law in their heart should have it in their mouth, and often speak of it, to affect themselves, and to teach others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Canaanites - Five nations only are named in this passage, whereas six are named in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, and ten in the original promise to Abraham, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>.

As the expression, "all the first-born," applied to both man and beast, the explanation is added, "everything that opens the womb among the Israelites, of man and beast." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1495;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; for &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1514; (<a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>): &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is placed like an adjective after the noun, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; for &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>, lxx). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;: "it is Mine," it belongs to Me. This right to the first-born was not founded upon the fact, that "Jehovah was the Lord and Creator of all things, and as every created object owed its life to Him, to Him should its life be entirely devoted," as Kurtz maintains, though without scriptural proof; but in <a href="/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a> and <a href="/numbers/8-17.htm">Numbers 8:17</a> the ground of the claim is expressly mentioned, viz., that on the day when Jehovah smote all the first-born of Egypt, He sanctified to Himself all the first-born of the Israelites, both of man and beast. Hence the sanctification of the first-born rested not upon the deliverance of the first-born sons from the stroke of the destroyer through the atoning blood of the paschal lamb, but upon the fact that God sanctified them for Himself at that time, and therefore delivered them. But Jehovah sanctified the first-born of Israel to Himself by adopting Israel as His first-born son (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), or as His possession. Because Israel had been chosen as the nation of Jehovah, its first-born of man and beast were spared, and for that reason they were henceforth to be sanctified to Jehovah. In what way, is more clearly defined in <a href="/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>.</body></html>
