The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word of the Lord - This gives the first indication that the warnings had a salutary effect upon the Egyptians.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. He that feared the word of the Lord &#8230; regarded not, &c.&#8212;Due premonition, it appears, had been publicly given of the impending tempest&#8212;the cattle seem to have been sent out to graze, which is from January to April, when alone pasturage can be obtained, and accordingly the cattle were in the fields. This storm occurring at that season, not only struck universal terror into the minds of the people, but occasioned the destruction of all&#8212;people and cattle&#8212;which, in neglect of the warning, had been left in the fields, as well as of all vegetation [Ex 9:25]. It was the more appalling because hailstones in Egypt are small and of little force; lightning also is scarcely ever known to produce fatal effects; and to enhance the wonder, not a trace of any storm was found in Goshen [Ex 9:26].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which strange mixture much increased the miracle.
