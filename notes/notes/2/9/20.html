Providence ordered it, that Moses should have a man of such a fierce and stubborn spirit as this Pharaoh to deal with; and every thing made it a most signal instance of the power of God has to humble and bring down the proudest of his enemies. When God's justice threatens ruin, his mercy at the same time shows a way of escape from it. God not only distinguished between Egyptians and Israelites, but between some Egyptians and others. If Pharaoh will not yield, and so prevent the judgment itself, yet those that will take warning, may take shelter. Some believed the things which were spoken, and they feared, and housed their servants and cattle, and it was their wisdom. Even among the servants of Pharaoh, some trembled at God's word; and shall not the sons of Israel dread it? But others believed not, and left their cattle in the field.

It is a new fact that any of the Egyptians had been brought to "fear the word of Jehovah." Probably, the effect of the plagues had been gradually to convince a considerable number, not so much that Jehovah was the one True God as that he was a great and powerful god, whose chastisements were to be feared. Consequently there were now a certain number among the "servants of Pharaoh" who pro-fired by the warning given (ver. 19), and housed their cattle and herdsmen, in anticipation of the coming storm. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the plagues had thus far entirely failed to bend the unyielding heart of Pharaoh under the will of the Almighty God, the terrors of that judgment, which would infallibly come upon him, were set before him in three more plagues, which were far more terrible than any that had preceded them. That these were to be preparatory to the last decisive blow, is proved by the great solemnity with which they were announced to the hardened king (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13-16</a>). This time Jehovah was about to "send all His strokes at the heart of Pharaoh, and against his servants and his people" (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; does not signify "against thy person," for &#1500;&#1489; is not used for &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, and even the latter is not a periphrasis for "person;" but the strokes were to go to the king's heart, "It announces that they will be plagues that will not only strike the head and arms, but penetrate the very heart, and inflict a mortal wound" (Calvin). From the plural "strokes," it is evident that this threat referred not only to the seventh plague, viz., the hail, but to all the other plagues, through which Jehovah was about to make known to the king that "there was none like Him in all the earth,;" i.e., that not one of the gods whom the heathen worshipped was like Him, the only true God. For, in order to show this, Jehovah had not smitten Pharaoh and his people at once with pestilence and cut them off from the earth, but had set him up to make him see, i.e., discern or feel His power, and to glorify His name in all the earth (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-15.htm">Exodus 9:15</a>, <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>). In <a href="/exodus/9-15.htm">Exodus 9:15</a> &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (I have stretched out, etc.) is to be taken as the conditional clause: "If I had now stretched out My hand and smitten thee...thou wouldest have been cut off." &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; forms the antithesis to &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1491;, and means to cause to stand or continue, as in <a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a> (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; lxx). Causing to stand presupposes setting up. In this first sense the Apostle Paul has rendered it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>, in accordance with the purport of his argument, because "God thereby appeared still more decidedly as absolutely determining all that was done by Pharaoh" (Philippi on <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>). The reason why God had not destroyed Pharaoh at once was twofold: (1) that Pharaoh himself might experience (&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; to cause to see, i.e., to experience) the might of Jehovah, by which he was compelled more than once to give glory to Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16-17</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>); and (2) that the name of Jehovah might be declared throughout all the earth. As both the rebellion of the natural man against the word and will of God, and the hostility of the world-power to the Lord and His people, were concentrated in Pharaoh, so there were manifested in the judgments suspended over him the patience and grace of the living God, quite as much as His holiness, justice, and omnipotence, as a warning to impenitent sinners, and a support to the faith of the godly, in a manner that should by typical for all times and circumstances of the kingdom of God in conflict with the ungodly world. The report of this glorious manifestation of Jehovah spread at once among all the surrounding nations (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>.), and travelled not only to the Arabians, but to the Greeks and Romans also, and eventually with the Gospel of Christ to all the nations of the earth (vid., Tholuck on <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>). </body></html>
