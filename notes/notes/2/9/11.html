But it would seem from this passage that they still continued about Pharaoh, and endeavoured to settle him in his resolution not to let Israel go: persuading him, perhaps, that although Moses had the better of them for the present, yet they should at last be too hard for him. But now, being on a sudden smitten with these ulcers, in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, they were rendered so contemptible, that they durst not again look either Moses or Pharaoh in the face; for we hear no more of them after this time. To this, it seems, the apostle refers, (<a href="/2_timothy/3-9.htm" title="But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.">2 Timothy 3:9</a>,) when he says their folly was “manifested unto all men.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:8-12 When the Egyptians were not wrought upon by the death of their cattle, God sent a plague that seized their own bodies. If lesser judgments do not work, God will send greater. Sometimes God shows men their sin in their punishment. They had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and now the ashes of the furnace are made a terror to them. The plague itself was very grievous. The magicians themselves were struck with these boils. Their power was restrained before; but they continued to withstand Moses, and to confirm Pharaoh in his unbelief, till they were forced to give way. Pharaoh continued obstinate. He had hardened his own heart, and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts, permitting Satan to blind and harden him. If men shut their eyes against the light, it is just with God to close their eyes.

Moses took ashes from the furnace&#8212;Hebrew, "brick-kiln." The magicians, being sufferers in their own persons, could do nothing, though they had been called; and as the brick-kiln was one of the principal instruments of oppression to the Israelites [De 4:20; 1Ki 8:51; Jer 11:4], it was now converted into a means of chastisement to the Egyptians, who were made to read their sin in their punishment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Could not stand before Moses, </span> as they hitherto had done, both as spies and as adversaries; for though their understandings were convinced of God’s hand and infinite power, yet their hearts were not changed; but for their worldly interest they persisted to rebel against their light., and therefore are justly plagued. It was no favour to Pharaoh that the plague was not upon him, but only a reservation to a greater mischief, as it follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boils,.... Which were on them as on others, and which with all their art and skill they could not keep off; and which were so sore upon them, and painful to them, that they were obliged to withdraw, and could not stand their ground, confronting Moses, contesting and litigating with him; for it seems, though they had not acted, nor attempted to act in imitation of Moses and Aaron, since the plague of the lice, yet they still continued about Pharaoh, lessening as much as in them lay the miracles wrought by them, and suggesting that they had done the most and the worst they could, and so contributing to harden the heart of Pharaoh against the people of Israel; wherefore they were righteously punished with boils for so doing, and for their contempt of the messengers and miracles of God, and for their imposition upon men, and their deception of them: <p>for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians; but not upon Moses and Aaron, nor upon any of the Israelites, and was afterwards called peculiarly the botch of Egypt, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

It is gathered from this that the magicians had, up to this time, been always in attendance when the miracles were wrought, though they had now for some time failed to produce any counterfeits of them. On this occasion their persistency was punished by the sudden falling of the pestilence upon themselves with such severity that they were forced to quit the royal presence and hasten to their homes to be nursed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The hand of Jehovah will be (&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, which only occurs here, as the participle of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, generally takes its form from &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="/nehemiah/6-6.htm">Nehemiah 6:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22</a>) against thy cattle...as a very severe plague (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; that which sweeps away, a plague), i.e., will smite them with a severe plague.

A definite time was also fixed for the coming of the plague, as in the case of the previous one (<a href="/exodus/8-23.htm">Exodus 8:23</a>), in order that, whereas murrains occasionally occur in Egypt, Pharaoh might discern in his one the judgment of Jehovah. </body></html>
