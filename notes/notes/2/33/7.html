Months would necessarily elapse before the Tabernacle could be constructed according to the pattern which he had seen in the mount. During this interval he determined to make use of one of the existing tents as a “house of prayer,” severing it from the others, and giving it the name “Tent of Meeting,” which was afterwards appropriated to the Tabernacle. It would seem that he selected his own tent for the purpose—probably because it was the best that the camp afforded—and contented himself with another.

The Tent of Meeting, and the use made of it by Moses. The sudden introduction of this notice of the Tent of Meeting is extremely surprising; and it is difficult to explain it, except by the conjecture mentioned on <span class="ital">v.</span> 6. The notice is a highly interesting and remarkable one, preserving, as it does, the oldest representation that we possess—that of E—of the Tent of Meeting, and differing in many particulars from the representation given by P (chs. 25–31, &c.). The ‘tent’ is obviously much simpler in structure than that of P; it is guarded by one attendant, the Ephraimite Joshua, instead of by the host of Levites pictured by P (Numbers 3-4); and it is <span class="ital">outside</span> the camp (so <a href="/numbers/11-26.htm" title="But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.">Numbers 11:26</a> f., <a href="/exodus/12-4.htm" title="And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.">Exodus 12:4</a>), at some distance from it, not in its centre, as in P (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm" title="Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.">Numbers 2:17</a>).

The decision of the matter still hung in suspense. God had not revoked his threat to withdraw himself and leave the host to the conduct of an angel. He had merely reserved his final decision (ver. 5). Moses was anxious to wrestle with him in prayer until he obtained the reversal of this sentence; but he could not be always ascending Sinai, when the camp needed his superintending care, and the camp as yet contained no place of worship, where a man could pray and be secure against disturbance. Moses, under these circumstances, with the tabernacle in his mind, but without leisure to construct it, contrived "for the present distress" a temporary tabernacle or tent. He took, apparently, the tent that had hitherto been his own, and removed it to a position outside the camp, erecting it there, and at the same time giving it the name of "the tent of meeting" (ver. 7). Hither he decreed that all persons should come who desired communion with God (ver. 7), and hither he resorted himself for the same purpose (ver. 8). It pleased God to approve these arrangements; and to show his approval by a visible token. Whenever Moses entered the "tent of meeting," the pillar of the cloud descended from the top of Sinai, and took up its station at the door of the tent (ver. 9), thus securing Moses from interruption. At the sight the people "worshipped," each at his tent's door, while Moses was privileged to speak with God "face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend" (ver. 11). Joshua accompanied him on the first occasion, and remained behind, to guard the tent, when Moses left it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>).  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> <span class="cmt_word">took the tabernacle.</span> The "tabernacle" proper was not yet constructed. (See chs. 35-40.) And the word used is not that properly rendered "tabernacle" - viz., <span class="accented">mishkan</span> (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>); but the far more common word <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which means "tent." The proper translation would be, "Moses took the tent." But the question at once arises - What tent? It is suggested that the article may have the force of the possessive pronoun, and indicate that he took "his tent." (Compare <a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10</a>, where "<span class="accented">the</span> house" undoubtedly means "<span class="accented">his</span> house.") Moses took his own tent, probably as the best in the encampment, and converted it to a sacred use, transferring his own abode to another. <span class="cmt_word">Afar off from the camp</span>. The sacred and the profane must not approach each other too closely - an interval must be set between them. But the distance, evidently, was not great (ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation.</span> Rather, "the tent of meeting" or "of conference" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the tent in which he expected to meet and converse with God. See the comment on Exodus 27:21. <span class="cmt_word">Every one which sought the Lord went out.</span> Moses must have commanded this. The "tent" was not to be a mere oratory for himself, but open to all Israelites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses' negotiations with the people, for the purpose of bringing them to sorrow and repentance, commenced with the announcement of what Jehovah had said.
