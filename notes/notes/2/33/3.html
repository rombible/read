Let them go forward as they are; this was very expressive of God's displeasure. Though he promises to make good his covenant with Abraham, in giving them Canaan, yet he denies them the tokens of his presence they had been blessed with. The people mourned for their sin. Of all the bitter fruits and consequences of sin, true penitents most lament, and dread most, God's departure from them. Canaan itself would be no pleasant land without the Lord's presence. Those who parted with ornaments to maintain sin, could do no less than lay aside ornaments, in token of sorrow and shame for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>.<p>For I will not go up in the midst of thee - The covenant on which the original promise <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a> was based had been broken by the people. Yahweh now therefore declared that though His Angel should go before Moses, He would withhold His own favoring presence. The nation should be put on a level with other nations, to lose its character as the people in special covenant with Yahweh (see the note at <a href="/exodus/33-16.htm">Exodus 33:16</a>).

At length there was an end of ambiguity - God's purpose was made plain - the people had shown themselves unfit for his near presence, and he would withdraw himself.

He had received no assurance of mercy in reply to his first entreaty (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>). He therefore announced his intention to the people in these words: "Peradventure I can make an atonement for your sin." But to the Lord he said (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-31.htm">Exodus 32:31</a>, <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>), "The sin of this people is a great sin; they have made themselves a god of gold," in opposition to the clear commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a> : "and now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin, and if not, blot me out of the book that Thou hast written." The book which Jehovah has written is the book of life, or of the living (<a href="/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). This expression is founded upon the custom of writing the names of the burgesses of a town or country in a burgess-list, whereby they are recognised as natives of the country, or citizens of the city, and all the privileges of citizenship are secured to them. The book of life contains the list of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>), and ensures to those whose names are written there, life before God, first in the earthly kingdom of God, and then eternal life also, according to the knowledge of salvation, which keeps pace with the progress of divine revelation, e.g., in the New Testament, where the heirs of eternal life are found written in the book of life (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, etc.), - an advance for which the way was already prepared by <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a> and <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>. To blot out of Jehovah's book, therefore, is to cut off from fellowship with the living God, or from the kingdom of those who live before God, and to deliver over to death. As a true mediator of his people, Moses was ready to stake his own life for the deliverance of the nation, and not to live before God himself, if Jehovah did not forgive the people their sin. These words of Moses were the strongest expression of devoted, self-sacrificing love. And they were just as deep and true as the wish expressed by the Apostle Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, that he might be accursed from Christ for the sake of his brethren according to the flesh. Bengel compares this wish of the apostle to the prayer of Moses, and says with regard to this unbounded fulness of love, "It is not easy to estimate the measure of love in a Moses and a Paul; for the narrow boundary of our reasoning powers does not comprehend it, as the little child is unable to comprehend the courage of warlike heroes" (Eng. Tr.). The infinite love of God is unable to withstand the importunity of such love. God, who is holy love, cannot sacrifice the righteous and good for the unrighteous and guilty, nor can He refuse the mediatorial intercession of His faithful servant, so long as the sinful nation has not filled up the measure of its guilt, in which case even the intercession of a Moses and a Samuel would not be able to avert the judgment (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>). Hence, although Jehovah puts back the wish and prayer of Moses with the words, "Whoever (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1502;&#1497;, both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-11.htm">2 Samuel 20:11</a>, is more emphatic than either one or the other alone) has sinned, him will I blot out of My book," He yields to the entreaty that He will ensure to Moses the continuance of the nation under His guidance, and under the protection of His angel, which shall go before it (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2-3</a>), and defer the punishment of their sin until the day of His visitation. </body></html>
