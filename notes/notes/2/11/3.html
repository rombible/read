To other writers he is a “prophet (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="/luke/24-27.htm" title="And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="/acts/7-37.htm" title="This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.">Acts 7:37</a>), or “a man of God” (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm" title="And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; Psalms 90, Title; <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>), or “the servant of the Lord” (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,">Joshua 1:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>); never simply “the man.”<p><span class= "bld">Very great.</span>—It has been said that this expression does not comport well with the “meekness” of Moses. But it is the mere statement of a fact, and of one necessary to be stated for the proper understanding of the narrative. Moses, in the course of his long contention as an equal with Pharaoh, had come to be regarded, not only by the courtiers, but by the Egyptians generally, as a great personage—a personage almost on a par with the Pharaoh, whom they revered as a god upon earth. The position to which he had thus attained exerted an important influence on the entire Egyptian people at this time, causing them to be well-inclined towards his countrymen, and willing to make sacrifices in order to help them and obtain their good-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/exodus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/11-3.htm" title="And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

This was the last day of the servitude of Israel; they were about to go away. Their masters, who had abused them in their work, would have sent them away empty; but God provided that the labourers should not lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now, at their departure, and it was given to them. God will right the injured, who in humble silence commit their cause to him; and none are losers at last by patient suffering. The Lord gave them favour in the sight of the Egyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them.

First of all, he had confounded the magicians (<a href="/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18, 19</a>); then he had so far impressed the courtiers that a number of them took advantage of one of his warnings and thereby saved their cattle and slaves (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>). Finally, he had forced the entire Court to acknowledge that it lay in his power to destroy or save Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>). He had after that parleyed with the king very much as an equal (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8-11; 16 -18). It is no wonder that the Egyptians, who regarded their king as a "great god," were deeply impressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 11:4 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ninth plague: The Darkness. - As Pharaoh's defiant spirit was not broken yet, a continuous darkness came over all the land of Egypt, with the exception of Goshen, without any previous announcement, and came in such force that the darkness could be felt. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;: "and one shall feel, grasp darkness." &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;: as in <a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-26.htm">Judges 16:26</a>, &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx); not "feel in the dark," for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; has this meaning only in the Piel with &#1489;&#1468; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>). &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;: darkness of obscurity, i.e., the deepest darkness. The combination of two words or synonyms gives the greatest intensity to the thought. The darkness was so great that they could not see one another, and no one rose up from his place. The Israelites alone "had light in their dwelling-places." The reference here is not to the houses; so that we must not infer that the Egyptians were unable to kindle any lights even in their houses. The cause of this darkness is not given in the text; but the analogy of the other plagues, which had all of them a natural basis, warrants us in assuming, as most commentators have done, that there was the same here - that it was in fact the Chamsin, to which the lxx evidently allude in their rendering: &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;. This wind, which generally blows in Egypt before and after the vernal equinox and lasts two or three days, usually rises very suddenly, and fills the air with such a quantity of fine dust and coarse sand, that the sun loses its brightness, the sky is covered with a dense veil, and it becomes so dark that "the obscurity cause by the thickest fog in our autumn and winter days is nothing in comparison" (Schubert). Both men and animals hide themselves from this storm; and the inhabitants of the towns and villages shut themselves up in the innermost rooms and cellars of their houses till it is over, for the dust penetrates even through well-closed windows. For fuller accounts taken from travels, see Hengstenberg (pp. 120ff.) and Robinson's Palestine i. pp. 287-289. Seetzen attributes the rising of the dust to a quantity of electrical fluid contained in the air. - The fact that in this case the darkness alone is mentioned, may have arisen from its symbolical importance. "The darkness which covered the Egyptians, and the light which shone upon the Israelites, were types of the wrath and grace of God" (Hengstenberg). This occurrence, in which, according to Arabian chroniclers of the middle ages, the nations discerned a foreboding of the day of judgment or of the resurrection, filled the king with such alarm that he sent for Moses, and told him he would let the people and their children go, but the cattle must be left behind. &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1490;: sistatur, let it be placed, deposited in certain places under the guard of Egyptians, as a pledge of your return. Maneat in pignus, quod reversuri sitis, as Chaskuni correctly paraphrases it. But Moses insisted upon the cattle being taken for the sake of their sacrifices and burnt-offerings. "Not a hoof shall be left behind." This was a proverbial expression for "not the smallest fraction." Bochart gives instances of a similar introduction of the "hoof" into proverbial sayings by both Arabians and Romans (Hieroz. i. p. 490). This firmness on the part of Moses he defended by saying, "We know not with what we shall serve the Lord, till we come thither;" i.e., we know not yet what kind of animals or how many we shall require for the sacrifices; our God will not make this known to us till we arrive at the place of sacrifice. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; with a double accusative as in <a href="/genesis/30-29.htm">Genesis 30:29</a>; to serve any one with a thing. </body></html>
