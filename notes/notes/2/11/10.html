See how slow God is to wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it, nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block to us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not a dog move his tongue - A proverb expressive of freedom from alarm and immunity front assault. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. all these thy servants shall &#8230; bow down themselves unto me&#8212;This would be the effect of the universal terror; the hearts of the proudest would be humbled and do reverential homage to God, in the person of His representative.<p>went out &#8230; in a great anger&#8212;Holy and righteous indignation at the duplicity, repeated falsehood, and hardened impenitence of the king; and this strong emotion was stirred in the bosom of Moses, not at the ill reception given to himself, but the dishonor done to God (Mt 19:8; Eph 4:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh,  Which are related in the preceding chapters: <p>and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart: one time after another, and yet more and more: <p>so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land; until the last plague, the slaying of the firstborn, was brought upon him and his people, related in the following chapter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">these</span> <span class="bld">portents</span>] The ‘portents’ described before in P (<a href="/context/exodus/7-8.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,...">Exodus 7:8-13</a>, and the ‘plagues’ narrated by P), not those referred to in <span class="ital">v.</span> 9. ‘It is only in P that Moses <span class="ital">and Aaron</span> do the signs, and that <span class="ital">before Pharaoh</span>, <a href="/exodus/7-9.htm" title="When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.">Exodus 7:9</a>, <a href="/exodus/9-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.">Exodus 9:8</a>’ (Di.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but Jehovah</span> <span class="ital">hardened</span>, &c., emphasizing the fact that the portents had had no effect upon the Pharaoh.

Aaron's agency is  not always mentioned, and seems to have been less marked in the later than in the earlier miracles, Moses gradually gaining self-reliance. In passing from the subject of the plagues wrought by the two brothers, it may be useful to give a synopsis of them, distinguishing those which came without warning from those which were announced beforehand, and noting, where possible, their actual worker, their duration, their physical source, and the hurt which they did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses' address to Pharaoh forms the continuation of his brief answer in <a href="/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a>. At midnight Jehovah would go out through the midst of Egypt. This midnight could not be "the one following the day on which Moses was summoned to Pharaoh after the darkness," as Baumgarten supposes; for it was not till after this conversation with the king that Moses received the divine directions as to the Passover, and they must have been communicated to the people at least four days before the feast of the Passover and their departure from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>). What midnight is meant, cannot be determined. So much is certain, however, that the last decisive blow did not take place in the night following the cessation of the ninth plague; but the institution of the Passover, the directions of Moses to the people respecting the things which they were to ask for from the Egyptians, and the preparations for the feast of the Passover and the exodus, all came between. The "going out" of Jehovah from His heavenly seat denotes His direct interposition in, and judicial action upon, the world of men. The last blow upon Pharaoh was to be carried out by Jehovah Himself, whereas the other plagues had been brought by Moses and Aaron. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; "in (through) the midst of Egypt:" the judgment of God would pass from the centre of the kingdom, the king's throne, over the whole land. "Every first-born shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh, that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid that is behind the mill," i.e., the meanest slave (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>, where the captive in the dungeon is substituted for the maid, prisoners being often employed in this hard labour, <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>), "and all the first-born of cattle." This stroke was to fall upon both man and beast as a punishment for Pharaoh's conduct in detaining the Israelites and their cattle; but only upon the first-born, for God did not wish to destroy the Egyptians and their cattle altogether, but simply to show them that He had the power to do this. The first-born represented the whole race, of which it was the strength and bloom (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>). But against the whole of the people of Israel "not a dog shall point its tongue" (<a href="/exodus/11-7.htm">Exodus 11:7</a>). The dog points its tongue to growl and bite. The thought expressed in this proverb, which occurs again in <a href="/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a> and Judith 11:19, was that Israel would not suffer the slightest injury, either in the case of "man or beast." By this complete preservation, whilst Egypt was given up to death, Israel would discover that Jehovah had completed the separation between them and the Egyptians. The effect of this stroke upon the Egyptians would be "a great cry," having no parallel before or after (cf. <a href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a>); and the consequence of this cry would be, that the servants of Pharaoh would come to Moses and entreat them to go out with all the people. "At thy feet," i.e., in thy train (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; <a href="/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>). With this announcement Moses departed from Pharaoh in great wrath. Moses' wrath was occasioned by the king's threat (<a href="/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28</a>), and pointed to the wrath of Jehovah, which Pharaoh would soon experience. As the more than human patience which Moses had displayed towards Pharaoh manifested to him the long-suffering and patience of his God, in whose name and by whose authority he acted, so the wrath of the departing servant of God was to show to the hardened king, that the time of grace was at an end, and the wrath of God was about to burst upon him. </body></html>
