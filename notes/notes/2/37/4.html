The incense represented the prayers of the saints. The sacrifice of the alter represented the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. The golden pot with manna, or bread from heaven, the flesh of Jesus Christ, which he gave for the life of the world. The candlestick, with its lights, the teaching and enlightening of the Holy Spirit. The shew-bread represented that provision for those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, which the gospel, the ordinances and the sacraments of the house of prayer, abundantly bestow. The exactness of the workmen to their rule, should be followed by us; seeking for the influences of the Holy Spirit, that we may rejoice in and glorify God while in this world, and at length be with him for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. <p>See the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. <p>For <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-9.htm">Exodus 38:9-20</a> see the notes to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 37<p>Ex 37:1-29.

It is not on that account to be regarded as a useless repetition of minute particulars; for by the enumeration of these details, it can be seen how exactly everything was fashioned according to the "pattern shown on the mount" [Ex 25:40]; and the knowledge of this exact correspondence between the prescription and the execution was essential to the purposes of the fabric.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood,.... Jarchi says, because he gave his mind to this work more than the rest of the wise men, it is called by his name. It is a notion of some Jewish writers that the ark was made by Bezaleel, without the help of others; but there is no sufficient reason to be given for it; for other things are equally ascribed to him in this and the following chapter, as the mercy seat with the cherubim, the shewbread table, the candlestick of pure gold, the two altars, the laver of brass, with other things, which are only said to be made by him, because they were made by his direction, and he having the oversight of them while making; wherefore Aben Ezra observes, that this is particularly said for the glory of the ark. Of the ark, and all other things mentioned in this chapter; see Gill on <a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1</a> &amp;c. to end of chapter; see Gill on <a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a> &amp;c. to end of chapter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/36-8.htm">Exodus 36:8-38:20</a>.
