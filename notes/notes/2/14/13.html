So long as we have means of resistance put in our power, with a reasonable prospect of success, it is our duty to use them—to exert ourselves to the uttermost, to make all possible efforts. God, for the most part, “helps those who help themselves.” But there are occasions when we can do nothing—when all must be left to Him. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm" title="You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.">2Chronicles 20:17</a>.) Under these circumstances, our duty and our true wisdom is to wait patiently, quietly, courageously.

A remarkable instance this of the composure of Moses’s mind, and the sedateness of his temper, and how well he deserved the character given him <a href="/numbers/12-3.htm" title="(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.)">Numbers 12:3</a>, of being one of the meekest of men. He did not answer these fools according to their folly: he does not chide, but comforts them; and with an admirable presence of mind, not in the least disconcerted or disheartened, either by the approach of Pharaoh, or the tremblings of Israel, he stills their murmurings, calmly exhorting them to take heart and trust in God. It is our duty when we cannot get out of our troubles, yet to get above our fears, so that they may only serve to quicken our prayers and endeavours, but may not prevail to silence our faith and hope.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:10-14 There was no way open to Israel but upward, and thence their deliverance came. We may be in the way of duty, following God, and hastening toward heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some cried out unto the Lord; their fear led them to pray, and that was well. God brings us into straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others cried out against Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not still able to work miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt; and so were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever done them; thus gross are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear ye not. It is always our duty and interest, when we cannot get out of troubles, yet to get above our fears; let them quicken our prayers and endeavours, but not silence our faith and hope. Stand still, think not to save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them. Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, into peaceful thoughts of the great salvation God is about to work for you.

Moses knew that the pursuit of Israel by the host of the Egyptians was a part of the counsel of God, and was to tend in some way or other to the promotion of God's honour and glory (ver. 4). He had sufficient faith to believe in a deliverance the nature of which  it is not likely that he could anyway conjecture. Whether hail would fall from heaven and destroy them (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>); or the earth gape and swallow them up (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>); or the angel of death smite them all in the night (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); or any other strange form of destruction come upon them, he did not know; but he concluded from what had been revealed to him, that God was about to vindicate his own honour without the aid of man. Hence his words - <span class="cmt_word">Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord</span> - which assigned to the Israelites a mere passive attitude of expectation. <span class="cmt_word">For the Egyptians</span>, etc. The order of the words in the original favours the marginal rendering, which is to be adopted with one slight change.

There is no reference to any other Egyptians than those with Pharaoh in the camp, nor to any later relations between Egypt and the chosen people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When it was announced that Israel had fled, "the heart of Pharaoh and his servants turned against the people," and they repented that they had let them go. When and whence the information came, we are not told. The common opinion, that it was brought after the Israelites changed their route, has no foundation in the text. For the change in Pharaoh's feelings towards the Israelites, and his regret that he had let them go, were caused not by their supposed mistake, but by their flight. Now the king and his servants regarded the exodus as a flight, as soon as they recovered from the panic caused by the death of the first-born, and began to consider the consequences of the permission given to the people to leave his service. This may have occurred as early as the second day after the exodus. In that case, Pharaoh would have had time to collect chariots and horsemen, and overtake the Israelites at Hachiroth, as they could easily perform the same journey in two days, or one day and a half, to which the Israelites had taken more than three. "He yoked his chariot (had it yoked, cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14</a>), and took his people (i.e., his warriors) with him," viz., "six hundred chosen war chariots (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and all the chariots of Egypt" (sc., that he could get together in the time), and "royal guards upon them all." &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, tristatae qui et terni statores vocantur, nomen est secundi gradus post regiam dignitatem (Jerome on <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>), not charioteers (see my Com. on <a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>, the army raised by Pharaoh consisted of chariot horses (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;), riding horses (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., runners, <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), and &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, the men belonging to them. War chariots and cavalry were always the leading force of the Egyptians (cf. <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>). Three times (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>, and <a href="/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>) it is stated that Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he pursued the Israelites, to show that God had decreed this hardening, to glorify Himself in the judgment and death of the proud king, who would not honour God, the Holy One, in his life. "And the children of Israel were going out with a high hand:" <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>. is a conditional clause in the sense of, "although they went out" (Ewald, 341). &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;, the high hand, is the high hand of Jehovah with the might which it displayed (<a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), not the armed hand of the Israelites. This is the meaning also in <a href="/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a>; it is different in <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>. The very fact that Pharaoh did not discern the lifting up of Jehovah's hand in the exodus of Israel displayed the hardening of his heart. "Beside Pihachiroth:" see <a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>. </body></html>
