What seems to tend to the church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church's enemies. While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furthered the bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with the greatest reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himself for it. God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, a torment to themselves.

The horses were thoroughbred, renowned for strength and spirit. Chariots are first represented on the monuments of the 18th dynasty. By "all the chariots of Egypt" we are to understand all that were stationed in Lower Egypt, most of them probably at Rameses and other frontier garrisons near the headquarters of Pharaoh.<p>Captains - The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  sha&#770;l&#305;&#770;ysh, literally "third or thirtieth," may represent an Egyptian title. The king had about him a council of thirty, each of whom bore a title, Mapu, a "thirty man." The word occurs frequently in the Books of Kings. David seems to have organized the Shalishim as a distinct corps (see <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a> Hebrew), retaining the old name, and adopting the Egyptian system. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. he made ready his chariot&#8212;His preparations for an immediate and hot pursuit are here described: A difference is made between "the chosen chariots" and "the chariots of Egypt." The first evidently composed the king's guard, amounting to six hundred, and they are called "chosen," literally, "third men"; three men being allotted to each chariot, the charioteer and two warriors. As to "the chariots of Egypt," the common cars contained only two persons, one for driving and the other for fighting; sometimes only one person was in the chariot, the driver lashed the reins round his body and fought; infantry being totally unsuitable for a rapid pursuit, and the Egyptians having had no cavalry, the word "riders" is in the grammatical connection applied to war chariots employed, and these were of light construction, open behind, and hung on small wheels.<span class="bld">Quest.</span> How. could he use or carry his chariots, when all his horses were killed by that plague? <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/9-6.htm" title="And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.">Exodus 9:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> That plague slew only the horses which were in the field, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm" title="Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.">Exodus 9:3</a></span>, not those kept in houses, as the chariot-horses generally were, and now are. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the chariots, </span> i.e. a great number; all that could be got together in haste, which the present service required. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Over every one of them; </span> over the men that fought out of every chariot.

But the 1200 assigned to Shishak (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) may well be regarded as historical; and the great kings of the nineteenth dynasty would possess at least an equal number. The "six hundred chosen chariots" set in motion on this occasion probably constituted a division of the royal body-guard (Herod. 2:168).

At Etham God commanded the Israelites to turn (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) and encamp by the sea, before Pihachiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baalzephon, opposite to it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-7.htm">Numbers 33:7</a>, the march is described thus: on leaving Etham they turned up to (&#1506;&#1500;) Pihachiroth, which is before (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;( e in the front of) Baalzephon, and encamped before Migdol. The only one of these places that can be determined with any certainty is Pihachiroth, or Hachiroth (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-8.htm">Numbers 33:8</a>, pi being simply the Egyptian article), which name has undoubtedly been preserved in the Ajrud mentioned by Edrisi in the middle of the twelfth century. At present this is simply a fort, which a well 250 feet deep, the water of which is so bitter, however, that camels can hardly drink it. It stands on the pilgrim road from Kahira to Mecca, four hours' journey to the north-west of Suez (vid., Robinson, Pal. i. p. 65). A plain, nearly ten miles long and about as many broad, stretches from Ajrud to the sea to the west of Suez, and from the foot of Atkah to the arm of the sea on the north of Suez (Robinson, Pal. i. 65). This plain most probably served the Israelites as a place of encampment, so that they encamped before, i.e., to the east of, Ajrud towards the sea. The other places just also be sought in the neighbourhood of Hachiroth (Ajrud), though no traces of them have been discovered yet. Migdol cannot be the Migdol twelve Roman miles to the south of Pelusium, which formed the north-eastern boundary of Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/29-10.htm">Ezekiel 29:10</a>), for according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-7.htm">Numbers 33:7</a>, Israel encamped before Migdol; nor is it to be sought for in the hill and mountain-pass called Montala by Burckhardt, el Muntala by Robinson (pp. 63, 64), two hours' journey to the northwest of Ajrud, as Knobel supposes, for this hill lies too far to the west, and when looked at from the sea is almost behind Ajrud; so that the expression "encamping before Migdol" does not suit this situation, not to mention the fact that a tower (&#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;) does not indicate a watch-tower (&#1502;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;). Migdol was probably to the south of Ajrud, on one of the heights of the Atkah, and near it, though more to the south-east, Baalzephon (locus Typhonis), which Michaelis and Forster suppose to be Heroopolis, whilst Knobel places it on the eastern shore, and others to the south of Hachiroth. If Israel therefore did not go straight into the desert from Etham, on the border of the desert, but went southwards into the plain of Suez, to the west of the head of the Red Sea, they were obliged to bend round, i.e., "to turn" from the road they had taken first. The distance from Etham to the place of encampment at Hachiroth must be at least a six hours' journey (a tolerable day's journey, therefore, for a whole nation), as the road from Suez to Ajrud takes four hours (Robinson, i. p. 66). </body></html>
