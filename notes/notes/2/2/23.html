It is a sign that the Lord is coming towards us with deliverance, when he inclines and enables us to cry to him for it. God heard their groaning; he made it to appear that he took notice of their complaints. He remembered his covenant, of which he is ever mindful. He considered this, and not any merit of theirs. He looked upon the children of Israel. Moses looked upon them, and pitied them; but now God looked upon them, and helped them. He had respect unto them. His eyes are now fixed upon Israel, to show himself in their behalf. God is ever thus, a very present help in trouble. Take courage then, ye who, conscious of guilt and thraldom, are looking to Him for deliverance. God in Christ Jesus is also looking upon you. A call of love is joined with a promise of the Redeemer.

According to Eusebius, Orus reigned in Egypt when Moses fled from thence, and that two more reigned after him, Acenchres and Achoris, who both died before the deliverance of the children of Israel; but according to Bishop Usher (b), this was the same king of Egypt under whom Moses was born, and from whose face he fled, who died in the sixty seventh year of his reign, Moses being now sixty years of age, and having been in the land of Midian twenty years; and it was about twenty years after this that he was called from hence, to be the deliverer of his people; for things are often put close together in Scripture, which were done at a considerable distance. And the intention of this notice of the death of the king of Egypt is chiefly to show that it made no alteration in the afflictions of the children of Israel for the better, but rather the worse: <p>and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage; the severity of it, and its long duration, and seeing no way for their escape out of it: <p>and they cried, and their cry came up unto God; they not only sighed and groaned inwardly, but so great was their oppression, that they could not forbear crying out aloud; and such was the greatness and vehemency of their cry, that it reached up to heaven, and came into the ears of the Almighty, as vehement cries are said to do, whether sinful or religious; see <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20</a>. <p>by reason of the bondage; which may either be connected with their "cry", that that was because of their bondage; or with the "coming" of it unto God, he was pleased to admit and regard their cry, because their bondage was so very oppressive and intolerable. <p>(b) Annal Vet.

The notice is intended to explain how it became possible for Moses to return to Egypt (see <a href="/exodus/4-19.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought your life.">Exodus 4:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the course of those</span> [<span class="ital">many</span>] <span class="ital">days</span>] the days of Moses’ sojourn in Midian. It seems that ‘many’ must be a redactional addition. Moses to all appearance married Zipporah not long after his arrival in Midian; and ‘according to J the Pharaoh must have died very soon after the birth of Gershom; for Gershom in <a href="/exodus/4-20.htm" title="And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.">Exodus 4:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-25.htm" title="Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.">Exodus 4:25</a> is represented as still quite young. J, therefore, did not picture Moses as remaining long in Midian. That is only the representation of P, according to whom (<a href="/exodus/7-7.htm" title="And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.">Exodus 7:7</a>) Moses is 80 years old when he treats with Pharaoh. If Moses was 30 (or 40) years old when he fled from Egypt, he would thus have remained in banishment 50 (or 40) years. This, however, agrees as well with the ‘many’ of <span class="ital">v.</span> 23a, as it agrees badly with the representation of J (<a href="/exodus/4-20.htm" title="And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.">Exodus 4:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-25.htm" title="Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.">Exodus 4:25</a>).

He had reigned sixty-seven years - about forty-seven alone, and about twenty in conjunction with his father. At his death, the oppressed Israelites ventured to hope for some amelioration of their condition. On his accession, a king in the East often reverses the policy of his predecessor, or at any rate, to make himself popular, grants a remission of burthens for a certain period. But at this time the new monarch, Menephthah I., the son of Rameses II., disappointed the hopes of the Israelites, maintained his father's policy, continued the established system of oppression, granted them no relief of any kind. They "sighed," therefore, in consequence of their disappointment, and "cried" unto God in their trouble, and made supplication to him more earnestly, more heartily, than ever before. We need not suppose that they had previously fallen away from their faith, and "now at last returned to God after many years of idolatrous aberration" (Aben Ezra, Kalisch). But there was among them an access of religious fervour; they "turned to God" from a state of deadness, rather from one of alienation, and raised a "cry" of the kind to which he is never deaf. God therefore "heard their groaning," deigned to listen to their prayers, and commenced the course of miraculous action which issued in the Exodus. (This section is more closely connected with what follows than with what went before, and would better begin ch. 3. than terminate ch. 2.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In process of time</span>. Literally, "in those <span class="accented">many days."</span> <span class="accented">The</span> reign of Rameses II. was exceptionally long, as previously explained. He had already reigned twenty-seven years when Moses fled from him (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). He had now reigned sixty-seven, and Moses was eighty! It had seemed a weary while to wait. <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel sighed</span>. If the time had seemed a weary while to Moses, how much more to his nation! He had escaped and was in Midian - they toiled on in Egypt. He kept sheep - they had their lives made "bitter" for them "with hard bondage, in molter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field" (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>). He could bring up his sons in safety; their sons were still thrown into the river. No wonder that "an exceeding bitter cry" went up to God from the oppressed people, so soon as they found that they had nothing to hope from the new king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/exodus/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here Moses secured for himself a hospitable reception from a priest of Midian, and a home at his house, by doing as Jacob had formerly done (<a href="/genesis/29-10.htm">Genesis 29:10</a>), viz., helping his daughters to water their father's sheep, and protecting them against the other shepherds. - On the form &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; for &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; vid., <a href="/genesis/19-19.htm">Genesis 19:19</a>; and for the masculine suffixes to &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>, cf. Ewald, 198a. - The flock of this priest consisted of nothing but &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., sheep and goats (vid., <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Even now there are no oxen reared upon the peninsula of Sinai, as there is not sufficient pasturage or water to be found. For the same reason there are no horses kept there, but only camels and asses (cf. Seetzen, R. iii. 100; Wellsted, R. in Arab. ii. p. 66). In <a href="/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a> the priest is called Reguel, in <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a> Jethro. This title, "the priest of Midian," shows that he was the spiritual head of the branch of the Midianites located there, but hardly that he was the prince or temporal head as well, like Melchizedek, as the Targumists have indicated by &#1512;&#1489;&#1488;, and as Artapanus and the poet Ezekiel distinctly affirm. The other shepherds would hardly have treated the daughters of the Emir in the manner described in <a href="/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>. The name &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (Reguel, friend of God) indicates that this priest served the old Semitic God El (&#1488;&#1500;). This Reguel, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses, was unquestionably the same person as Jethro (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;) the &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; of Moses and priest of Midian (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Now, as Reguel's son Chobab is called Moses' &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; in <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> (cf. <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>), the Targumists and others supposed Reguel to be the grandfather of Zipporah, in which case &#1488;&#1489; would mean the grandfather in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; the granddaughter in <a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>. This hypothesis would undoubtedly be admissible, if it were probable on other grounds. But as a comparison of <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a> does not necessarily prove that Chobab and Jethro were the same persons, whilst <a href="/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27</a> seems to lead to the very opposite conclusion, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1503;, like the Greek &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, may be used for both father-in-law and brother-in-law, it would probably be more correct to regard Chobab as Moses' brother-in-law, Reguel as the proper name of his father-in-law, and Jethro, for which Jether (praestantia) is substituted in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>, as either a title, or the surname which showed the rank of Reguel in his tribe, like the Arabic Imam, i.e., praepositus, spec. sacrorum antistes. Ranke's opinion, that Jethro and Chobab were both of them sons of Reguel and brothers-in-law of Moses, is obviously untenable, if only on the ground that according to the analogy of <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> the epithet "son of Reguel" would not be omitted in <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>. </body></html>
