It was also designed to prepare him for the services he was to be called to. His manner of life in Midian, where he kept the flock of his father-in-law, would inure him to hardship and fatigue, and to contemplation and devotion. Egypt accomplished him for a scholar, a gentleman, a statesman, a soldier; all which accomplishments would be afterward of use to him; but yet lacked he one thing, in which the court of Egypt could not befriend him. He who was to do all by divine revelation, must know what it was to live a life of communion with God, and in this he would be greatly furthered by the retirement of a shepherd’s life in Midian. By the former he was prepared to rule in Jeshurun, but by the latter he was prepared to converse with God in mount Horeb.

He was ready to help Reuel's daughters to water their flocks, although bred in learning and at court. Moses loved to be doing justice, and to act in defence of such as he saw injured, which every man ought to do, as far as it is in his power. He loved to be doing good; wherever the providence of God casts us, we should desire and try to be useful; and when we cannot do the good we would, we must be ready to do the good we can. Moses commended himself to the prince of Midian; who married one of his daughters to Moses, by whom he had a son, called Gershom, a stranger there, that he might keep in remembrance the land in which he had been a stranger.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gershom - The first syllable "Ger" is common to Hebrew and Egyptian, and means "sojourner."

He afterwards formed a close and permanent alliance with this family by marrying one of the daughters, Zipporah, "a little bird," called a Cushite or Ethiopian (Nu 12:1), and whom Moses doubtless obtained in the manner of Jacob by service [see Ex 3:1]. He had by her two sons, whose names were, according to common practice, commemorative of incidents in the family history [Ex 18:3, 4].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom,.... Which signifies a "desolate stranger"; partly on his own account, he being in a foreign country, a stranger and sojourner; but not by way of complaint, but rather of thankfulness to God for providing so well for him in it; and partly on his son's account, that when he came to years of maturity and knowledge, he might learn, and in which Moses no doubt instructed him, that he was not to look upon Midian as his proper country, but that he was to be heir of the land of Canaan, and which he might be reminded of by his name: <p>for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land; so Midian was to him, who was born in Egypt, and being an Hebrew, was entitled to the land of Canaan; this looks as if he had been at this time some years in Midian. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/exodus/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">Gershom</span>] The name might conceivably be derived from <span class="greekheb">גרש</span>, and mean <span class="ital">expulsion</span>.

Ewald, 198a. - The flock of this priest consisted of nothing but &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., sheep and goats (vid., <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Even now there are no oxen reared upon the peninsula of Sinai, as there is not sufficient pasturage or water to be found. For the same reason there are no horses kept there, but only camels and asses (cf. Seetzen, R. iii. 100; Wellsted, R. in Arab. ii. p. 66). In <a href="/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a> the priest is called Reguel, in <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a> Jethro. This title, "the priest of Midian," shows that he was the spiritual head of the branch of the Midianites located there, but hardly that he was the prince or temporal head as well, like Melchizedek, as the Targumists have indicated by &#1512;&#1489;&#1488;, and as Artapanus and the poet Ezekiel distinctly affirm. The other shepherds would hardly have treated the daughters of the Emir in the manner described in <a href="/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>. The name &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (Reguel, friend of God) indicates that this priest served the old Semitic God El (&#1488;&#1500;). This Reguel, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses, was unquestionably the same person as Jethro (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;) the &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; of Moses and priest of Midian (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Now, as Reguel's son Chobab is called Moses' &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; in <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> (cf. <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>), the Targumists and others supposed Reguel to be the grandfather of Zipporah, in which case &#1488;&#1489; would mean the grandfather in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; the granddaughter in <a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>. This hypothesis would undoubtedly be admissible, if it were probable on other grounds. But as a comparison of <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a> does not necessarily prove that Chobab and Jethro were the same persons, whilst <a href="/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27</a> seems to lead to the very opposite conclusion, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1503;, like the Greek &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, may be used for both father-in-law and brother-in-law, it would probably be more correct to regard Chobab as Moses' brother-in-law, Reguel as the proper name of his father-in-law, and Jethro, for which Jether (praestantia) is substituted in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>, as either a title, or the surname which showed the rank of Reguel in his tribe, like the Arabic Imam, i.e., praepositus, spec. sacrorum antistes. Ranke's opinion, that Jethro and Chobab were both of them sons of Reguel and brothers-in-law of Moses, is obviously untenable, if only on the ground that according to the analogy of <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> the epithet "son of Reguel" would not be omitted in <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>. </body></html>
