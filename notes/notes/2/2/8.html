Had he been left there long, he must have perished. But Providence brings Pharaoh's daughter to the place where this poor forlorn infant lay, and inclines her heart to pity it, which she dares do, when none else durst. God's care of us in our infancy ought to be often mentioned by us to his praise. Pharaoh cruelly sought to destroy Israel, but his own daughter had pity on a Hebrew child, and not only so, but, without knowing it, preserved Israel's deliverer, and provided Moses with a good nurse, even his own mother. That he should have a Hebrew nurse, the sister of Moses brought the mother into the place of a nurse. Moses was treated as the son of Pharoah's daughter. Many who, by their birth, are obscure and poor, by surprising events of Providence, are raised high in the world, to make men know that God rules.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/exodus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She had compassion on him - The Egyptians regarded such tenderness as a condition of acceptance on the day of reckoning. In the presence of the Lord of truth each spirit had to answer, "I have not afflicted any man, I have not made any man weep, I have not withheld milk from the mouths of sucklings" ('Funeral Ritual'). There was special ground for mentioning the feeling, since it led the princess to save and adopt the child in spite of her father's commands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/exodus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-9. when she had opened it, she saw the child&#8212;The narrative is picturesque. No tale of romance ever described a plot more skilfully laid or more full of interest in the development. The expedient of the ark, the slime and pitch, the choice of the time and place, the appeal to the sensibilities of the female breast, the stationing of the sister as a watch of the proceedings, her timely suggestion of a nurse, and the engagement of the mother herself&#8212;all bespeak a more than ordinary measure of ingenuity as well as intense solicitude on the part of the parents. But the origin of the scheme was most probably owing to a divine suggestion, as its success was due to an overruling Providence, who not only preserved the child's life, but provided for his being trained in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Hence it is said to have been done by faith (Heb 11:23), either in the general promise of deliverance, or some special revelation made to Amram and Jochebed&#8212;and in this view, the pious couple gave a beautiful example of a firm reliance on the word of God, united with an active use of the most suitable means.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/exodus/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, go,....

From <a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a> we learn that Moses was not the first child of this marriage, but his brother Aaron; and from <a href="/exodus/2-7.htm">Exodus 2:7</a> of this chapter, it is evident that when Moses was born, his sister Miriam was by no means a child (<a href="/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59</a>). Both of these had been born before the murderous edict was issued (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>). They are not mentioned here, because the only question in hand was the birth and deliverance of Moses, the future deliverer of Israel. "When the mother saw that the child was beautiful" (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; as in <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>; lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), she began to think about his preservation. The very beauty of the child was to her "a peculiar token of divine approval, and a sign that God had some special design concerning him" (Delitzsch on <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>). The expression &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; in <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a> points to this. She therefore hid the new-born child for three months, in the hope of saving him alive. This hope, however, neither sprang from a revelation made to her husband before the birth of her child, that he was appointed to be the saviour of Israel, as Josephus affirms (Ant. ii. 9, 3), either from his own imagination or according to the belief of his age, nor from her faith in the patriarchal promises, but primarily from the natural love of parents for their offspring. And if the hiding of the child is praised in <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a> as an act of faith, that faith was manifested in their not obeying the king's commandment, but fulfilling without fear of man all that was required by that parental love, which God approved, and which was rendered all the stronger by the beauty of the child, and in their confident assurance, in spite of all apparent impossibility, that their effort would be successful (vid., Delitzsch ut supra). This confidence was shown in the means adopted by the mother to save the child, when she could hide it no longer.</body></html>
