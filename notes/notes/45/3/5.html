That, too, is an impossible objection, for if it held good there could not be any judgment. No sin would be punishable, for all sin would serve to emphasise the strict veracity of God in His denunciations of it, and therefore would ultimately conduce to His glory. It would thus cease to be sinful, and there would be nothing to hinder us from adopting the principle that is so calumniously attributed to us—that it is lawful to do evil that good may come. A calumny it is, and any such principle with all that appertains to it—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with the whole of the preceding argument,—is justly condemned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

But Dr. Whitby understands, by <span class="ital">the righteousness of God, </span>the righteousness of faith, which indeed is generally the meaning of the phrase in this epistle; and, as in the first chapter the necessity of this faith is shown with respect to the Gentiles, because otherwise they, being unrighteous, could not be justified before God, or escape his wrath <span class="ital">revealed against all unrighteousness; </span>and in the second chapter the same is proved respecting the Jews by reason of their unrighteousness, which arguments plainly serve to commend and establish this way of righteousness by faith in Christ, from the necessity of it to the justification both of Jews and Gentiles; he therefore considers the import of the objection to be, “If the unrighteousness both of Jews and Gentiles tend so visibly to illustrate and recommend the wisdom and grace of God, in appointing this way of justification by faith in Christ, is it righteous in God to punish both Jews and Gentiles, as you say he has done and will do, for that unrighteousness that tends so highly to advance the glory of divine grace displayed in the gospel?” <span class="ital">What shall we say </span>— What inference shall we draw? <span class="ital">Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance </span>— Must we grant that God acts unjustly in punishing those practices which so illustrate his mercy, faithfulness, and other perfections? <span class="ital">I speak as a man </span>— As a mere natural man, not acquainted with the revealed will of God, or not influenced by his Spirit; or as human weakness would be apt to speak. <span class="ital">God forbid </span>— That I should harbour such a thought, or allow such a consequence; <span class="ital">for then </span>— If it were unjust in him to punish that unrighteousness which is subservient to his own glory, <span class="ital">how should God judge the world — </span>Since all the unrighteousness in the world will then commend the righteousness of God. Add to this, the very idea of God’s judging the world, implies that it shall be done <span class="ital">in righteousness. </span>For if any person were to have injustice done him on that occasion, it would not be judgment, but a capricious exercise of power, whereby the Judge would be dishonoured. On this idea is founded the answer which Abraham made to God, respecting the destruction of Sodom, which answer perhaps the apostle had now in his eye, <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>; <span class="ital">Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if our unrighteousness - If our sin. The particular sin which had been specified <a href="/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3</a> was "unbelief." But the apostle here gives the objection a general form. This is to be regarded as an objection which a Jew might make. The force of it is this:<p>(1) It had been conceded that some had not believed; that is, had sinned.<p>(2) but God was true to his promises. Notwithstanding their sin, God's character was the same. Nay,<p>(3) In the very midst of sin, and as one of the results of it, the character of God, as a just Being, shone out illustriously. The question then was,<p>(4) If his glory resulted from it; if the effect of all was to show that his character was pure; how could he punish that sin from which his own glory resulted? And this is a question which is often asked by sinners.<p>Commend - Recommend; show forth; render illustrious.<p>The righteousness of God - His just and holy character. This was the effect on David's mind, that he saw more clearly the justice of God in his threatenings against sin, in consequence of his own transgression. And if this effect followed, if honor was thus done to God, the question was, how he could consistently punish what tended to promote his own glory?<p>What shall we say? - What follows? or, what is the inference? This is a mode of speech as if the objector hesitated about expressing an inference which would seem to follow, but which was horrible in its character.<p>Is God unrighteous? - The meaning of this would be better expressed thus: "Is "not" God unrighteous in punishing? Does it not follow that if God is honored by sin, that it would be wrong for him to inflict punishment?"<p>Who taketh vengeance - The meaning of this is simply, "who inflicts punishment." The idea of vengeance is not necessarily in the original &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  orge&#772;n. It is commonly rendered "wrath," but it often means simply "punishment," without any reference to the state of the mind of him who inflicts it, <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>.

I speak as appears to be the case to human view; or as would strike the human mind. It does not mean that the language was such as wicked people were accustomed to use; but that the objector expressed a sentiment which to human view would seem to follow from what had been said. This I regard as the language of an objector. It implies a degree of reverence for the character of God, and a seeming unwillingness to state an objection which seemed to be dishonorable to God, but which nevertheless pressed itself so strong on the mind as to appear irresistible. No way of stating the objection could have been more artful or impressive. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

Hence it appears, that the unrighteousness of men commends the righteousness, or faithfulness of God; and yet all unrighteousness is sin; the wrath of God is revealed against it; and would exclude from heaven, were it not for pardon through the blood of Christ; and besides, the one is contrary to the other, and of itself, of its own nature, cannot influence and affect the other: wherefore this can only be understood of the manifestation and illustration of, the righteousness of God by it; which is covered and commended, in punishing the unrighteousness of men; in setting forth Christ to be a propitiation for sin; and in fulfilling his promises, notwithstanding the failings of his people, of which the case of David is a pregnant proof; just as the love of God is illustrated and commended, by the consideration of the sins of men, for whom Christ died, and his grace and mercy in the conversion of them: but if this be true, <p>what shall we say? shall we allow the following question to be put? this answers to  , "what is there to say", or "to be said?" a way of speaking, often used by the Talmudists (n): <p>is God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? if the premises are true, this is a just consequence of them; whereas God does take vengeance on men for their unrighteousness, both here and hereafter, it must be a piece of unrighteousness in him so to do; since that for which he takes vengeance on them commends his own righteousness; but that you may know as well by what follows, that this is not an inference of his own, but another's, he adds, <p>I speak as a man;  , "according to the language of the children of men", a phrase often used by the Jewish doctors (o).

But how easily might this be misconstrued by a Jew of the common type as a pretext for his immorality: “the unrighteousness of man in fact brings out more clearly the righteousness of God, and therefore may not be righteously punished by God!” To preclude this misconception and false inference, which so abruptly run counter to his doctrine of universal human guilt, and to leave no pretext remaining (observe beforehand the <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν</span>; <span class="greekheb">προεχόμεθα</span> in <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

For examples of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφέρειν</span> used to express the practical infliction of wrath or punishment see Raphel, <span class="ital">Polyb.</span>; Kypke, II. p. 160. The <span class="ital">article</span> with the participle indicates the relation as <span class="ital">well-known;</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὀργήν</span> (Sin.* adds <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>) denotes the wrath definitely conceived of as <span class="ital">judicial</span>, inflicted at the judgment.

(see Philippi). But this view overlooks the fact that the whole thought, which is implied in the question calculated though it is for a negative reply,—the thought of the unrighteousness of God in punishing—can in fact only be put into expression <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἄνθρωπον</span>; in the higher Christian insight a conception so blasphemous and deserving of abhorrence can find neither place nor utterance. The apology however, involved in <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἄνθρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>, is applicable only to <span class="ital">what goes before</span>, not to <span class="ital">what follows</span>, to which Mehring, Th.

Compare <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>.

Even the following proof, <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> f., does not present a reference directly to the judgment of the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>. The argument itself rests on the premiss that God can carry out the <span class="ital">judgment</span> of the world only as One who is <span class="ital">righteous</span> in His decreeing of wrath. The opposite would be impossible, not only subjectively, in God Himself (Th. Schott), but also objectively, as standing in contradiction to the notion of a world-judgment. See <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> f. This proposition however is so perfectly <span class="ital">certain</span> to the <span class="ital">consciousness of faith</span>, out of which Paul asserts it, that there is no ground either for complaining of the <span class="ital">weakness</span> of the proof (Rückert), or for reading the thoughts that form the proof between the lines (Fritzsche and Mehring, with varying arbitrariness); the more especially as afterwards, in <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a>, a still further <span class="ital">confirmation</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπεί</span>.… <span class="greekheb">κόσμον</span> follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[748] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[749] After <span class="greekheb">μή</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐροῦμεν</span> is not again to be understood, and then <span class="greekheb">ἄδικος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to be taken as a question ensuing <span class="ital">thereon</span> (Mangold, p. 106).

Surely not that God, He who inflicts the wrath due to unrighteousness at the last day (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>), is Himself unrighteous, to speak as men speak. Away with the thought! If this were so, how should God judge the world? That God <span class="ital">does</span> judge the world at last is a fixed point both for Paul and those with whom he argues; hence every inference which conflicts with it must be summarily set aside. God could not judge at all if He were unjust; therefore, since He does judge, He is not unjust, not even in judging men whose unrighteousness may have served as a foil to His righteousness. It is not thus that the conclusions of chap. 2 can be evaded by the Jew. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπιφέρων τὴν ὀργήν</span>: the “attributive participle equivalent to a relative clause, may, like a relative clause, convey a subsidiary idea of cause, purpose, condition or concession” (Burton, <span class="ital">Moods and Tenses</span>, § 428, who renders here: is God unrighteous, who (because He) visiteth with wrath?). <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἄνθρωπον λέγω</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15</a>, <a href="/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="Say I these things as a man? or said not the law the same also?">1 Corinthians 9:8</a>. There is always something apologetic in the use of such expressions. Men forget the difference between God and themselves when they contemplate such a situation as that God should be unrighteous; obviously it is not to be taken seriously. Still, in human language such suppositions are made, and Paul begs that in his lips they may not be taken for more than they really mean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">unrighteousness … righteousness</span>] General terms, but implying the special forms of <span class="ital">unbelief</span> and <span class="ital">fidelity</span>.

The interrogative particle is that which regularly expects the answer “<span class="ital">No</span>.” But the turn of this argument suggests a question (<span class="ital">from the Opponent</span>) expecting “<span class="ital">Yes</span>.” (The above use of the particle in question is not <span class="ital">quite</span> invariable in Gr., but it holds in all other cases <span class="ital">in St Paul</span>.) To us it seems that the solution is as follows: The Apostle gives the Opponent’s question, but jealousy for God’s honour compels him to modify it by his own intense sense of the Divine righteousness. The Opponent demands the answer “<span class="ital">Yes;</span>” St Paul is forced to make him, grammatically, demand the answer “<span class="ital">No</span>.” Instead of his would-be “<span class="ital">Is not</span> God unrighteous, &c.?” it thus stands, “<span class="ital">Is</span> God unrighteous, &c.?”—in which at most the question is left, verbally, open.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">taketh vengeance</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">inflicteth the wrath</span>; i.e. the wrath merited by the special sin; the wrath which had fallen on Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I speak as a man</span>] i.e. “on merely human principles, from mere man’s point of view.” This serious questioning about right and wrong in the Eternal and His acts is, in St Paul’s view, “speaking as man.” In the light of the Holy Spirit’s teaching it is impossible, unless (as here) by way of a mere argumentative formula.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?
