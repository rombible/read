How does it affect the pretensions of the Jew? It shuts them out by laying stress no longer on works, which were the proper fulfilment of the first law as it stood, but upon faith. Faith is the true medium of justification. And faith belongs as much to Gentile as to Jew. For faith is the appointed means by which all mankind will be justified; and they will all be justified before the same tribunal, whether they be circumcised or not. Still this involves no abrogation of the Law, but rather a confirmation of it.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">It is excluded.</span>—Strictly, <span class= "ital">It was excluded</span>—at the moment when the law of faith—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the gospel—was brought in.<p><span class= "bld">By what law?</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">By what kind of law?</span> Is this law which gets rid of boasting one which calls for works; or is it one that calls for faith?<p><span class= "bld">The law of faith.</span>—Another name for the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then?

Or the boasting of the Jews against the Gentiles, or that of any one in his own righteousness, or on account of any peculiar privileges he may enjoy. <span class="ital">It is excluded </span>— This way of justification by free grace, through faith, leaves no room to any one for boasting of what he is, or has, or does, or can do. <span class="ital">By what law? Of works? </span>— By that of Moses, or any other law, promising life only to perfect obedience, and threatening all disobedience with inevitable death? Nay; this, if the fulfilling of it had been practicable, and a man could have been justified thereby, would have left him room for boasting, even that he had procured his justification by his own virtue and goodness. <span class="ital">But by the law of faith </span>— “The <span class="ital">law of faith </span>here, as opposed to the <span class="ital">law of works, </span>is that gracious covenant which God made with mankind immediately after the fall.

Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Where is boasting then? - Where is there ground or occasion of boasting or pride?

There is no room nor reason for it, either in Jews or Gentiles: not in the Jews, who were very apt to boast of their being Abraham's seed; of their circumcision; of their being Israelites; of their having and keeping the law; of God being their God; and of their knowledge of him: nor in the Gentiles, who were ready to boast of their philosophy, wisdom, and learning; of their self-sufficiency, freewill, and of the things they had in their own power. <p>It is excluded; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it is not allowed of; it is entirely exploded: <p>by what law? of works? nay; for, that establishes boasting when men seek life, righteousness, and salvation by the works of it, and fancy they shall be able to attain them this way: <p>but by the law of faith: not by a law requiring faith; nor as if the Gospel was a law, a new law, a remedial law, a law of milder terms; but the word "law" here answers to the Hebrew word  which signifies any "doctrine" or "instruction", and oftentimes the doctrine of the Gospel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, and here particularly, the doctrine of a sinner's justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ; according to which doctrine the most unlikely persons are justified, even ungodly persons, the worst and vilest of sinners; and that without any consideration of works, by faith only, which is freely given them; and by faith in Christ's righteousness only: so that there is not the least room for boasting in the creature, but all their boasting is in Christ, who is made unto them righteousness, and by whom they are justified. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Where <i>is</i> boasting then?

It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith....">Romans 3:27-31</a>. In these verses the positive exposition of the righteousness of God as offered to faith through the redemption in Christ Jesus, is concluded. The Apostle points out two inferences which can be drawn from it, and which go to commend it to religious minds. The first is, that it excludes boasting. A religious constitution under which men could make claims, or assume anything, in the presence of God, must necessarily be false; it is at least one mark of truth in the Christian doctrine of justification that by it such presumption is made impossible. The second is, that in its universality and its sameness for all men, it is consistent with (as indeed it flows from) the unity of God. There can be no step-children in the family of God; a system which teaches that there are, like that current among the Jews, must be wrong; a system like the Christian, which excludes such an idea, is at least so far right. In <a href="/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a> an objection is raised. The whole system just expounded may be said to make Law void—to stultify and disannul all that has ever been regarded as in possession of Divine moral authority in the world.

It is excluded. By what manner of (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Is it, then, here implied that the law of works would allow of boasting? Not so <span class="accented">practically.</span> But its <span class="accented">theory</span> would leave room for it, on the supposition of its conditions being fulfilled; it is a <span class="accented">kind</span> of law (observe <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>;) which does not exclude it; for if a man could say, "I have fulfilled all the righteousness of the Law," he would have something wherein to glory. But the <span class="accented">principle</span> of the law of faith, which has been shown to be the only one available for the justification of either Jew or Gentile, in itself excludes it. It will be observed that the strict sense of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, hitherto preserved, is extended in <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>.

Is it a law that enjoins these works? Nay, but a law which enjoins faith. Paul does not suppose two laws and give the preference to one. There is but one divine law of ejectment, the quality of which is such that, instead of enjoining the Jews' works, it enjoins faith. The old and the new forms of the religious life are brought under the one conception of law. </body></html>
