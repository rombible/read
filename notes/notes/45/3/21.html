But now, in contrast with the previous state of things, a new system has appeared upon the scene. In this system law is entirely put on one side, though the system itself was anticipated in and is attested by those very writings in which the Law was embodied. Law is now superseded, the great end of the Law, the introduction of righteousness, being accomplished in another way, viz., through faith in Christ, by which a state of righteousness is superinduced upon all believers.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">But now.</span>—In these latter days.

and that the method of justification revealed in the gospel was the method in which men were justified under the law, and before the law: in short, it is the method of justifying sinners, established from the very beginning of the world. <span class="ital">Even the righteousness of God </span>— That which God hath appointed to be, <span class="ital">by faith of Jesus Christ </span>— By such a firm, hearty, lively belief of Christ’s being what the gospel declares him to be, a divinely-commissioned and infallible Teacher, a prevalent Mediator between God and man; an all- sufficient Saviour, and a righteous Governor; such a belief as produces a sincere confidence in him, a true subjection to him, a conscientious obedience to his laws, and imitation of his example. <span class="ital">Unto all — </span>Which way of justification is provided for, and sincerely and freely offered unto all, and is bestowed <span class="ital">upon all them that believe </span>— Whether Jews or Gentiles; <span class="ital">for there is no difference </span>— Either as to men’s need of justification and salvation, or the manner of attaining it. <span class="ital">For all have sinned </span>— In Adam and in their own persons; by a sinful nature, sinful tempers, and sinful actions; <span class="ital">and come short of the glory of God </span>— The supreme end of man; short of his image and nature, and communion with him, and the enjoyment of him in heaven. Or, they have failed of rendering him that glory that was so justly his due, and thereby have not only made themselves unworthy the participation of glory and happiness with him, but stand exposed to his severe and dreadful displeasure. The word <span class="greekheb">υσερουνται</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">come short, </span>is properly applied to those, whose strength failing them in the race, are left behind. The word, therefore, is very suitable to mankind, who, being weakened by sin, have lost eternal life, the reward which they pursued by their obedience. <span class="ital">Being justified </span>— Pardoned and accepted, or accounted righteous; <span class="ital">freely, </span><span class="greekheb">δωρεαν</span>, <span class="ital">of free gift, </span>and not through any merit of their own; <span class="ital">by his grace — </span>His unmerited favour, his undeserved goodness, and not through their own righteousness or works, in whole or in part. <span class="ital">Freely by his grace </span>— One of these expressions might have served to convey the apostle’s meaning: but he doubles his assertion in order to give us the fullest conviction of the truth, and to impress us with a sense of its peculiar importance. It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness. <span class="ital">Through the redemption which is in, </span>or <span class="ital">by, Christ Jesus </span>— Procured for them by his death, the price paid for their redemption. The word <span class="greekheb">απολυτρωσις</span>, here and elsewhere rendered <span class="ital">redemption, </span>denotes that kind of redemption of a captive from death, which is procured by paying a price for his life. See note on <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1 Timothy 2:6</a>. The redemption purchased for us by Christ is deliverance from the guilt and power of sin, and the wrath of God consequent thereon, and from the power of our spiritual enemies, the devil, the world, and the flesh. See <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-14.htm" title=" In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:">Colossians 1:14</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;...">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now - The apostle, having shown the entire failure of all attempts to be justified by the "Law," whether among Jews or Gentiles, proceeds to state fully the plan of justification by Jesus Christ in the gospel. To do this, was the main design of the Epistle, <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. He makes, therefore, in the close of this chapter, an explicit statement of the nature of the doctrine; and in the following parts of the Epistle he fully proves it, and illustrates its effects.<p>The righteousness of God - God's plan of justifying people; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>.<p>Without the law - In a way different from personal obedience to the Law. It does not mean that God abandoned his Law; or that Jesus Christ did not regard the Law, for he came to "magnify" it <a href="/isaiah/42-21.htm">Isaiah 42:21</a>; or that sinners after they are justified have no regard to the Law; but it means simply what the apostle had been endeavoring to show, that justification could not be accomplished by personal obedience to any law of Jew or Gentile, and that it must be accomplished in some other way.<p>Being witnessed - Being borne witness to. It was not a new doctrine; it was found in the Old Testament. The apostle makes this observation with special reference to the Jews. He does not declare any new thing, but that which was rally declared in their own sacred writings.<p>By the law - This expression here evidently denotes, as it did commonly among the Jews, the five books of Moses. And the apostle means to say that this doctrine was found in those books; not that it was in the Ten Commandments, or in the Law, strictly so called. It is not a part of "law" to declare justification except by strict and perfect obedience. That it was found "in" those books; the apostle shows by the case of Abraham; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>; see also his reasoning on <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-12.htm">Deuteronomy 30:12-14</a>, in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5-11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>.<p>And the prophets - Generally, the remainder of the Old Testament. The phrase "the Law and the prophets" comprehended the whole of the Old Testament; <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-13.htm">Matthew 11:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-40.htm">Matthew 22:40</a>; <a href="/acts/13-15.htm">Acts 13:15</a>; <a href="/acts/28-23.htm">Acts 28:23</a>. That this doctrine was contained in the prophets, the apostle showed by the passage quoted from <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, "The just shall live by faith." The same thing he showed in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>, from <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6-8</a>, from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-11</a>. The same thing is fully taught in <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>. Indeed, the general tenor of the Old Testament - the appointment of sacrifices, etc. taught that man was a sinner, and that he could not be justified by obedience to the moral law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ro 3:21-26.

The universal need of a Gospel has now been demonstrated, and the Apostle proceeds with his exposition of this Gospel itself. It brings what all men need, a righteousness of God (see on <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>); and it brings it in such a way as to make it accessible to all. Law contributes nothing to it, though it is attested by the law and the prophets; it is a righteousness which is all of grace. Grace, however, does not signify that moral distinctions are ignored in God’s procedure: the righteousness which is held out in the Gospel is held out on the basis of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. It is put within the sinner’s reach at a great cost. It could never be offered to him—it could never be manifested, or indeed have any real existence—but for the propitiatory virtue of the blood of Christ. Christ a propitiation is the inmost soul of the Gospel for sinful men. If God had not set Him forth in this character, not only must we despair for ever of attaining to a Divine righteousness; all our attempts to read the story of the world in any consistency with the character of God must be baffled. Past sins God seemed simply to ignore: He treated them apparently as if they were not. But the Cross is “the Divine theodicy for the past history of the world” (Tholuck); we see in it how seriously God deals with the sins which for the time He seemed to pass by. It is a demonstration of His righteousness—that is, in the widest sense, of His consistency with His own character,—which would have been violated by indifference to sin. And that demonstration is, by God’s grace, given in such a way that it is possible for Him to be (as He intends to be) at once just Himself, and the justifier of those who believe in Jesus. The propitiatory death of Jesus, in other words, is at once the vindication of God and the salvation of man. That is why it is central and fundamental in the Apostolic Gospel. It meets the requirements, at the same time, of the righteousness of God and of the sin of man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21–31</span>.

This passage, in which the thesis of <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> is formally enunciated, is consistent with this meaning; in confirmation of which observe vers. 25, 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently means God's own righteousness, as also above, ver. 5. If this view is correct, there is no need to follow commentators into their discussions of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in supposed connection with the idea of man's <span class="accented">imputed</span> righteousness; such as whether it is meant to declare justification through Christ to be <span class="accented">without the aid</span> of the Law - "sine legis adminiculo" (Calvin) - or to exclude all legal <span class="accented">works</span>, done before, or even after justification, from any share in the office of justification. However true these positions may be, what is said here seems simply to mean that God's righteousness has been manifested in Christ in a different way, and on a different principle, from that of law. The principle of law is to enjoin and forbid, and to require complete obedience; but law, even as exhibited in the Divine Law of the Jews, has been shown to fail to enable man thus to attain to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; therefore, apart from this exacting principle, the righteousness of God is now revealed to man, embracing him in itself. The absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here, and its insertion in the latter clause of the same verse, where the Mosaic Law is definitely referred to, is fully explained by what has been said above under Romans 2:13. <span class="accented">Being witnessed</span>, etc., is introduced parenthetically by way of intimating that this manifestation of God's righteousness, though "apart from law," is not in any opposition to the teaching of the Law and the prophets, being, in fact, anticipated by them.
