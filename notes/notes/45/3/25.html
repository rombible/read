(2) It was to demonstrate the righteousness of God by showing that sin would entail punishment, though it might not be punished in the person of the sinner. The apparent absence of any adequate retribution for the sins of past ages made it necessary that by one conspicuous instance it should be shown that this was in no sense due to an ignoring of the true nature of sin. The retributive justice of God was all the time unimpaired. The death of Christ served for its vindication, at the same time that a way to escape from its consequences was opened out through the justification of the believer.<p>Precisely in what sense the punishment of our sins fell upon Christ, and in what sense the justice of God was vindicated by its so falling, is another point which we are not able to determine. Nothing, we may be sure, can be involved which is in <span class= "ital">ultimate</span> conflict with morality. At the same time, we see that under the ordinary government of God, the innocent suffer for the guilty, and there may be some sort of transference of this analogy into the transcendental sphere. Both the natural and the supernatural government of God are schemes “imperfectly comprehended.” In any case, Christ was innocent, and Christ suffered. On any theory there is a connection between His death and human sin. <span class= "ital">What</span> connection, is a question to which, perhaps, only a partial answer can be given. Some weighty remarks on this subject will be found in Butler’s <span class= "ital">Analogy of Religion,</span> Part II., Romans 5 (latter part).<p>(25) <span class= "bld">Hath set forth.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">set forth, publicly exhibited,</span> in the single act of the death upon the cross.<p><span class= "bld">A propitiation.</span>—The Greek word properly means “that which renders propitious.” Here, “that which renders God propitious.” In some way, which is not explained at all in this passage, and imperfectly explained elsewhere, the death of Christ did act so as to render God “propitious” towards men. He became more ready to pardon as they became more anxious to be pardoned.<p>There is a remarkable use of the same Greek word in the LXX. version of the Old Testament to express the <span class= "ital">mercy-seat, i.e.,</span> the lid or covering of the ark which was sprinkled by the high priest with the blood of the victim on the Day of Atonement. Some have thought that there is a reference to this here. Christ is the <span class= "ital">mercy-seat</span> of the New Covenant. It is upon Him, as it were, that the divine grace, drawn forth by His own atoning blood, resides. It would hardly be a conclusive objection to this view that, according to it, Christ would be represented as at once the victim whose blood is sprinkled and the covering of the ark on which it is sprinkled; for a similar double reference certainly occurs in <a href="/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>, where Christ is typified at one and the same time both by the victim whose blood is shed and by the high priest by whom it is offered. There seem to be, however, on the whole, reasons for supplying rather the idea of “sacrifice,” which is more entirely in keeping with the context, and is especially supported by the two phrases, “whom God hath set forth (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> exhibited <span class= "ital">publicly,</span> whereas the ark was confined to the secrecy of the Holy of Holies), and “in His blood.” We should translate, therefore, <span class= "ital">a propitiatory</span> or <span class= "ital">expiatory </span>(<span class= "ital">sacrifice</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Through faith.</span>—Faith is the <span class= "ital">causa apprehendens</span> by which the proffered pardon takes effect upon the soul of the believer.<p><span class= "bld">In his blood.</span>—On the whole, it seems best not to join these words with “through faith,” but to refer them to the main word of the sentence. “Whom God set forth by the shedding of His blood to be a propitiatory offering through faith.” It was in the shedding of the blood that the essence of the atonement exhibited upon the cross consisted. No doubt other portions of the life of Christ led up to this one; but this was the culminating act in it, viewed as an atonement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;...">Romans 3:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whom God hath set forth </span>— Before angels and men: hath in his infinite mercy exhibited to us in the gospel, <span class="ital">to be a propitiation </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ιλαστηριον</span>, <span class="ital">a propitiatory, </span>or mercy-seat, where mercy may be found by the penitent, in a way consistent with divine justice. The reader will observe, the cover of the ark, in the tabernacle and temple of the Israelites, was called the <span class="ital">mercy-seat, </span>or propitiatory, and is termed by the LXX., <a href="/exodus/25-17.htm" title="And you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.">Exodus 25:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">ιλαστηριον επιθεμα</span>, <span class="ital">a propitiatory cover, </span>“because it was the throne on which the glory of the Lord was wont to be displayed, and received the atonements made by the high-priest on the day of expiation, and from which God dispensed pardon to the people. In allusion to this ancient worship, the apostle represents Christ as a <span class="ital">propitiatory, </span>or <span class="ital">mercy-seat, </span>set forth by God for receiving the worship of men, and dispensing pardon to them. Or, if a <span class="ital">propitiatory </span>is, by a common metonymy, put for <span class="ital">a propitiatory sacrifice, </span>the apostle’s meaning will be, that, by the appointment of God, Christ died as a sacrifice for sin, and that God pardons sin through the merit of that sacrifice. Hence Christ is called <span class="greekheb">ιλασμος</span>, <span class="ital">a propitiation, </span><a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1 John 4:10</a>. By teaching this doctrine, the apostle removed the great objection of Jews and heathen against the gospel, that it had neither a priest nor a sacrifice.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Through faith in his blood </span>— Through believing that Christ’s blood was shed to expiate our sins, and trusting therein for pardon and acceptance with God, and all other benefits which he has thereby procured for us: <span class="ital">to declare, </span><span class="greekheb">εις ενδειξιν</span>, <span class="ital">for a demonstration of his, </span>God’s, own <span class="ital">righteousness: </span>both his justice and mercy, especially the former, that thereby it might appear he could pardon sin, without any impeachment of his righteousness, in that he did not pardon it without full satisfaction made to the law by the sufferings of Christ, who was wounded for our transgressions, and on whom was laid that chastisement of sin which was necessary to procure our peace, and render our acceptance with God consistent with the divine perfections, and the equity of his government. <span class="ital">For the remission of sins that are past </span>— All the sins antecedent to their believing. Or the expression, <span class="greekheb">δια την παρεσιν των προγεγονοτων αμαρτηματων</span>, may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">on account of the passing by, </span>or not instantly and adequately punishing, <span class="ital">sins which were before committed, </span>that is, before the coming of Christ: the sins of which both Jews and Gentiles had been guilty before the gospel was promulgated, and on account of which both deserved destruction, and were unworthy of the blessings of God’s covenant. Now God’s righteousness or justice might have appeared doubtful, on account of his having so long, in his great <span class="ital">forbearance, </span>thus passed by the sins of men, unless in the mean time he had made a sufficient display of his hatred to sin. But such a display being made in the death of Christ, his justice is thereby fully proved. Doddridge thus paraphrases the passage: “The remission extends not only to the present but former age, and to all the offences <span class="ital">which are </span>long since <span class="ital">past, according to the forbearance of God, </span>who has forborne to execute judgment upon sinners for their repeated provocations, in reference to that atonement which he knew should in due tinge be made.” <span class="ital">To declare, </span><span class="greekheb">προς ενδειξιν</span>, <span class="ital">for a demonstration of his righteousness </span>(see the former verse) <span class="ital">at this time </span>— <span class="greekheb">εν τω νυν καιρω</span>, <span class="ital">at this period </span>of his showing mercy to sinners. As if he had said, When he most highly magnified his mercy in finding out this way of reconciliation, he did also most eminently declare his justice, in requiring such satisfaction for the transgression of his law: <span class="ital">that he might be just </span>— Might evidence himself to be strictly and inviolably righteous in the administration of his government, even while he is the merciful <span class="ital">justifier of </span>the sinner <span class="ital">that believeth in Jesus </span>— Who so believes in Jesus, as to embrace this way of justification, renouncing all merit in himself, and relying entirely on the sacrifice and intercession of Christ, for reconciliation with God, and all the blessings of the new covenant. The attribute of justice must be preserved inviolate; and inviolate it is preserved, if there was a real infliction of punishment on Christ. On this plan all the attributes harmonize; every attribute is glorified, and not one superseded, nor so much as clouded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="ital">just, </span>indeed, in this verse, Taylor would understand <span class="ital">merciful, </span>and Locke, <span class="ital">faithful to his promises; </span>but “either of these,” as Doddridge observes, “makes but a very cold sense, when compared with that here given. It is no way wonderful that God should be merciful, or <span class="ital">faithful to his promises, </span>though the <span class="ital">justifier of believing sinners; </span>but that he should be <span class="ital">just </span>in such an act, might have seemed incredible, had we not received such an account of the atonement.” This subject is set in a clear and striking light by a late writer: “The two great ends of public justice are the glory of God, and in connection with it, the general good of his creatures. It is essentially necessary to the attainment of these ends, that the authority of the government of God should be supported, in all its extent, as inviolably sacred; — that one jot or tittle should in no wise pass from the law; — that no sin, of any kind, or in any degree, should appear as venial; — that if any sinner is pardoned, it should be in such a way, as, while it displays the divine mercy, shall at the same time testify the divine abhorrence of his sins. All this is gloriously effected in the gospel, by means of <span class="ital">atonement; </span>— by the substitution of a voluntary surety, even of him whose name is Immanuel, to bear the curse of the law, in the room of the guilty. In his substitution we see displayed, in a manner unutterably affecting and awful, the <span class="ital">holy purity </span>of the divine nature; for no testimony can be conceived more impressive, of infinite abhorrence of sin, than the sufferings and death of the Son of God. Here too we behold the <span class="ital">immutable justice </span>of the divine government, inflicting the righteous penalty of a violated law. It is to be considered as a fixed principle of the divine government, that <span class="ital">sin must be punished; </span>that if the sinner is pardoned, it must be in a way that <span class="ital">marks </span>and <span class="ital">publishes the evil of his offence. </span>This is effected by substitution; and, as far as we can judge, could not be effected in any other way. In inflicting the sentence against transgression on the voluntary and all-sufficient Surety, <span class="ital">Jehovah, </span>while he clears the sinner, does not clear his sins; — although clothed with the thunders of vindictive justice against transgression, he wears, to the transgressor, the smile of reconciliation and peace; — he dispenses the blessings of mercy from the throne of his holiness; and, while exercising grace to the guilty, he appears in the character — equally lovely and venerable — of —<span class="bld"><span class="ital"> the sinner’s friend, And sin’s eternal foe!</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“In this way, then, all the ends of <span class="ital">public justice </span>are fully answered. The law retains its complete unmitigated perfection; is ‘magnified and made honourable:’ the dignity and authority of the divine government are maintained, and even elevated: all the perfections of Deity are gloriously illustrated and exhibited in sublime harmony. While the riches of mercy are displayed, for the encouragement of sinners to return to God, the solemn lesson is at the same time taught, by a most convincing example, that rebellion cannot be persisted in with impunity; and motives are thus addressed to the fear of evil, as well as to the desire of good. Such a view of the Divine Being is presented in the cross as is precisely calculated to inspire and to maintain (to maintain, too, with a power which will increase in influence the more closely and seriously the view is contemplated) the two great principles of a holy life — the LOVE, and the FEAR OF GOD; — filial attachment, freedom, and confidence, combined with humble reverence and holy dread.” See Mr. Ralph Wardlaw’s <span class="ital">Discourses on the Principal Points of the Socinian Controversy, </span>pp. 211-213.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom God hath set forth - Margin, "Fore-ordained" (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  proetheto). The word properly means, "to place in public view;" to exhibit in a conspicuous situation, as goods are exhibited or exposed for sale, or as premiums or rewards of victory were exhibited to public view in the games of the Greeks. It sometimes has the meaning of decreeing, purposing, or constituting, as in the margin (compare <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>); and many have supposed that this is its meaning here. But the connection seems to require the usual signification of the word; and it means that God has publicly exhibited Jesus Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of people. This public exhibition was made by his being offered on the cross, in the face of angels and of people. It was not concealed; it was done openly. He was put to open shame; and so put to death as to attract toward the scene the eyes of angels, and of the inhabitants of all worlds.<p>To be a propitiation - &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  hilaste&#772;rion.

It is used here to denote the lid or cover of the ark of the covenant. It was made of gold, and over it were the cherubim.

The Hebrew name for this was &#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;  kaphoreth, from the verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;  kaaphar, "to cover" or "to conceal." It was from this place that God was represented as speaking to the children of Israel. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>, "and I will speak to thee from above the Hilasterion, the propitiatory, the mercy-seat. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, "For I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat." This seat, or cover, was covered with the smoke of the incense, when the high priest entered the most holy place, <a href="/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>.<p>And the blood of the bullock offered on the great day of atonement, was to be sprinkled "upon the mercy-seat," and "before the mercy-seat," "seven times," <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14-15</a>. This sprinkling or offering of blood was called making "an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel," etc. <a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>. It was from this mercy-seat that God pronounced pardon, or expressed himself as reconciled to his people. The atonement was made, the blood was sprinkled, and the reconciliation thus effected. The name was thus given to that cover of the ark, because it was the place from which God declared himself reconciled to his people. Still the inquiry is, why is this name given to Jesus Christ? In what sense is he declared to be a propitiation? It is evident that it cannot be applied to him in any literal sense. Between the golden cover of the ark of the covenant and the Lord Jesus, the analogy must be very slight, if any such analogy can be perceived. We may observe, however,<p>(1) That the main idea, in regard to the cover of the ark called the mercy-seat, was that of God's being reconciled to his people; and that this is the main idea in regard to the Lord Jesus whom "God hath set forth."<p>(2) this reconciliation was effected then by the sprinkling of blood on the mercy-seat, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>. The same is true of the Lord Jesus - by blood.<p>(3) in the former case it was by the blood of atonement; the offering of the bullock on the great day of atonement, that the reconciliation was effected, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17-18</a>. In the case of the Lord Jesus it was also by blood; by the blood of atonement. But it was by his own blood. This the apostle distinctly states in this verse.<p>(4) in the former case there was a sacrifice, or expiatory offering; and so it is in reconciliation by the Lord Jesus. In the former, the mercy-seat was the visible, declared place where God would express his reconciliation with his people. So in the latter, the offering of the Lord Jesus is the manifest and open way by which God will be reconciled to people.<p>(5) in the former, there was joined the idea of a sacrifice for sin, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. So in the latter. And hence, the main idea of the apostle here is to convey the idea of a sacrifice for sin; or to set forth the Lord Jesus as such a sacrifice. Hence, the word "propitiation" in the original may express the idea of a propitiatory sacrifice, as well as the cover to the ark. The word is an adjective, and may be joined to the noun sacrifice, as well as to denote the mercy-seat of the ark. This meaning accords also with its classic meaning to denote a propitiatory offering, or an offering to produce reconciliation. Christ is thus represented, not as a mercy-seat, which would be unintelligible; but as the medium, the offering, the expiation, by which reconciliation is produced between God and man.<p>Through faith - Or by means of faith. The offering will be of no avail without faith. The offering has been made; but it will not be applied, except where there is faith. He has made an offering which may be efficacious in putting away sin; but it produces no reconciliation, no pardon, except where it is accepted by faith.<p>In his blood - Or in his death - his bloody death. Among the Jews, the blood was regarded as the seat of life, or vitality. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "the life of the flesh is in the blood." Hence, they were commanded not to eat blood. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, "but flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." <a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-34.htm">1 Samuel 14:34</a>. This doctrine is contained uniformly in the Sacred Scriptures. And it has been also the opinion of not a few celebrated physiologists, as well in modern as in ancient times. The same was the opinion of the ancient Parsees and Hindus. Homer thus often speaks of blood as the seat of life, as in the expression &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  porphureos thanatos, or "purple death." And Virgil speaks of "purple life,"<p>Purpuream vomit ille animam.<p>AEniad, ix. 349.<p>Empedocles and Critias among the Greek philosophers, also embraced this opinion. Among the moderns, Harvey, to whom we are indebted for a knowledge of the circulation of the blood, fully believed it. Hoffman and Huxham believed it Dr. John Hunter has fully adopted the belief, and sustained it, as he supposed, by a great variety of considerations. See Good's Book of Nature, pp. 102, 108, New York edition, 1828. This was undoubtedly the doctrine of the Hebrews; and hence, with them to shed the blood was a phrase signifying to kill; hence, the efficacy of their sacrifices was supposed to consist in the blood, that is, in the life of the victim. Hence, it was unlawful to eat it, as it were the life, the seat of vitality; the more immediate and direct gift of God. When, therefore, the blood of Christ is spoken of in the New Testament, it means the offering of his life as a sacrifice, or his death as an expiation. His life was given to make atonement.

Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation&#8212;or "propitiatory sacrifice."<p>through faith in his blood&#8212;Some of the best interpreters, observing that "faith upon" is the usual phrase in Greek, not "faith in" Christ, would place a "comma" after "faith," and understand the words as if written thus: "to be a propitiation, in His blood, through faith." But "faith in Christ" is used in Ga 3:26 and Eph 1:15; and "faith in His blood" is the natural and appropriate meaning here.<p>to declare his righteousness for the remission&#8212;rather, "pretermission" or "passing by."<p>of sins&#8212;"the sins."<p>that are past&#8212;not the sins committed by the believer before he embraces Christ, but the sins committed under the old economy, before Christ came to "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."<p>through the forbearance of God&#8212;God not remitting but only forbearing to punish them, or passing them by, until an adequate atonement for them should be made. In thus not imputing them, God was righteous, but He was not seen to be so; there was no "manifestation of His righteousness" in doing so under the ancient economy. But now that God can "set forth" Christ as a "propitiation for sin through faith in His blood," the righteousness of His procedure in passing by the sins of believers before, and in now remitting them, is "manifested," declared, brought fully out to the view of the whole world. (Our translators have unfortunately missed this glorious truth, taking "the sins that are past" to mean the past sins of believers&#8212;committed before faith&#8212;and rendering, by the word "remission," what means only a "passing by"; thus making it appear that "remission of sins" is "through the forbearance of God," which it certainly is not).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whom God hath set forth; </span> i.e. God the Father hath proposed this <span class="bld">Jesus, </span> in the eternal counsel, and covenant of redemption, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a>,21</span>; or in the types and shadows of the old tabernacle; and hath now at last shown him openly to the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To be a propitiation, </span> or atonement, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1Jo 2:2</a></span>.

Redemption by Christ is here further explained, by his being "a propitiation": which word may design either Christ the propitiator, the author of peace and reconciliation; or the propitiatory sacrifice, by which he is so; and both in allusion to the mercy seat, which was a type of him as such. The apostle here uses the same word, which the Septuagint often render "the mercy seat", by; and Philo the Jew calls it by the same name, and says it was a symbol,    "of the propitious power of God" (b). Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and sacrifice; and which, as it could not be done by any other, nor in any other way, is expressed by "reconciliation", and "atonement": whence God may be said to be pacified, or made propitious; not but that he always loved his people, and never hated them; nor is there, nor can there be any change in God, from hatred to love, any more than from love to hatred: Christ has not, by his sacrifice and death, procured the love and favour of God, but has removed the obstructions which lay in the way of love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law broken, and justice provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his sacrifice has satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the effects of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even according to justice itself; so that it is not love, but justice that is made propitious: for this is all owing to the grace and goodness of God, who "hath set him forth", for this intent, in his eternal purposes and decrees; in the promises of the Old Testament, in the types, shadows, and sacrifices of the old law; by the exhibition of him in our nature, and in the ministration of the Gospel; and this is said to be <p>through faith in his blood. The "blood" of Christ is that, by which Christ is the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood, there is no redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of sin; and "faith" in his blood is the means by which persons become partakers of the benefits of his propitiation; such as peace, pardon, atonement, justification, and adoption: and the end of Christ's being set forth as a propitiation, on the part of God's people, is, <p>for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God: by "sins that are past", are meant, not sins before baptism, nor the sins of a man's life only, but the sins of Old Testament saints, who lived before the incarnation of Christ, and the oblation of his sacrifice; and though this is not to be restrained to them only, for Christ's blood was shed for the remission of all his people's sins, past, present, and to come; yet the sins of the saints before the coming of Christ, seem to be particularly designed; which shows the insufficiency of legal sacrifices, sets forth the efficacy of Christ's blood and sacrifice, demonstrates him to be a perfect Saviour, and gives us reason under the present dispensation to hope for pardon, since reconciliation is completely made: "remission" of sin does not design that weakness which sin has brought upon, and left in human nature, whereby it is so enfeebled, that it cannot help itself, and therefore Christ was set forth, and sent forth, to be a propitiation; but rather God's passing by, or overlooking sin, and not punishing for it, under the former dispensation; or else the forgiveness of it now, and redemption from it by the blood of Christ, "through the forbearance of God"; in deferring the execution of justice, till he sent his Son, and in expecting satisfaction of his Son; which shows the grace and goodness of God to his people, and the trust and confidence he put in his Son: the other end on the part of God, in setting forth Christ to be a propitiation, was <p>to declare his righteousness <a href="/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a>; meaning either the righteousness of Christ, which was before hid, but now manifested; or rather the righteousness of God the Father, his faithfulness in his promises relating to Christ, his grace and goodness in the mission of his Son, the holiness and purity of his nature, and his vindictive justice, in avenging sin in his own Son, as the surety of his people: the execution of this was threatened from the beginning; the types and sacrifices of the old law prefigured it; the prophecies of the Old Testament express it; and the sufferings and death of Christ openly declare it, since God spared not his own Son, but sheathed the sword of justice in him. <p>(b) Philo de Vita Mosis, l. 3. p. 668. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Whom God hath set forth <i>to be</i> a propitiation through faith in his <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> are past, through the <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> forbearance of God;</span><p>(10) God then is the author of that free justification, because it pleased him: and Christ is he who suffered punishment for our sins, and in whom we have remission of them: and the means by which we apprehend Christ is faith.

Mos.</span> p. 668, <span class="ital">D</span> and <span class="ital">E</span>; <span class="ital">de profug.</span> p. 465 A), who expressly represents the covering of the ark as a symbol of the <span class="greekheb">ἵλεω δυνάμεως</span> of God. Compare also Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> iii. 6, 5. There is consequently nothing to be urged against this explanation, either as respects the <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span> or as respects the idea, in accordance with which Christ, the bearer of the divine glory and grace, sprinkled with His own sacrificial blood, would be regarded as the antitype of the Kapporeth. But we may urge against it: (1) that <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱλαστηρ</span>. does not stand with the article, as in the Sept. and <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>, although Christ was to be designated as the realised idea of the definite and in fact singly existing <span class="greekheb">כפרת</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀληθινὸν ἱλαστήριον</span>, Theodoret); (2) that even though the term <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>, as applied to the cover of the ark, was certainly familiar to the readers from its use by the LXX., nevertheless this name, in its application to Christ, would come in here quite <span class="ital">abruptly</span>, without anything in the context preparing the way for it or leading to it; (3) that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΈΘΕΤΟ</span></span></span> would in that case be inappropriate, because the ark of the covenant, in the Holy of Holies, was removed from the view of the people; (4) that, if Christ were really thought of here as <span class="greekheb">כפרת</span>, the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ἜΝΔΕΙΞΙΝ Τῆς ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗς ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> would be inappropriate, since the <span class="greekheb">כפרת</span> must have appeared rather as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΝΔΕΙΞΙς</span></span></span> of the divine <span class="ital">grace</span> (comp <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>); (5) and lastly, that the conception of Christ as the antitype of the cover of the ark is found nowhere else in the whole N. T., although there was frequent opportunity for such expression; and it is therefore to be assumed that it did not belong to the apostolic modes of viewing and describing the atoning work of Christ. Moreover, if it is objected that this interpretation is unsuitable, because Christ, who shed His own blood, could not be the cover of the ark sprinkled with foreign blood, it is on the other hand to be remembered that the Crucified One sprinkled with His own blood might be regarded as the cover of the ark with the same propriety as Christ offering His own blood is regarded in the Epistle to the Hebrews as High Priest. If, on the other side, it is objected to the interpretation <span class="ital">expiatory offering</span> (see Philippi), that it does not suit <span class="greekheb">προέθετο</span> because Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice to God, but God did not present Him as such to humanity, the objection is untenable, since the idea that <span class="ital">God</span> has given Christ to death pervades the whole N. T.—not that God has thereby <span class="ital">offered</span> Christ as a sacrifice, which is nowhere asserted, but that He <span class="ital">has set forth</span> before the eyes of the universe Him who is surrendered to the world by the very fact of His offering Himself as a sacrifice in obedience to the Father’s counsel, as such actually and publicly, namely, on the cross. An exhibition <span class="ital">through preaching</span> (as Philippi objects) is not to be thought of, but rather the divine <span class="ital">Acts of redemption</span>, which took place through the sacrificial death on Golgotha.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως</span>] may be connected either with <span class="greekheb">προέθετο</span> (Philippi, following older writers) or with <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> (Rückert, Matthias, Ewald, Hofmann, Morison, and older expositors). The latter is the right construction, since faith, as laying hold of the propitiation, is the very thing by which the <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> set forth becomes <span class="ital">subjectively effective</span>; but not that whereby the <span class="ital">setting forth itself</span>, which was an <span class="ital">objective fact</span> independent of faith, has been accomplished.[865] Hence: <span class="ital">as a sacrifice producing the</span> <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσκεσθαι</span> <span class="ital">through faith</span>.

Other writers again erroneously make <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>.… <span class="greekheb">αἵματι</span> dependent on <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span> (Luther, Calvin, Beza, Seb. Schmid, and others; also Koppe, Klee, Flatt, Olshausen, Tholuck, Winzer, and Morison), joining <span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστ</span>. likewise to <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>: <span class="ital">through faith on His blood</span>. In that case <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would not be equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, but would indicate the <span class="ital">basis</span> of faith (see on <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>); nor can the absence of the article after <span class="greekheb">πίστ</span>. be urged against this rendering (see on Gal. <span class="ital">l.c</span>[874]): but the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἵμ</span>. becomes in this connection much too subordinate a point. Just <span class="ital">by means of the shedding of His blood</span> was the setting forth of Christ for a propitiatory offering accomplished; in order that through this utmost, highest, and holiest sacrifice offered for the satisfaction of the divine justice—through the blood of Christ—that justice might be brought to light and demonstrated. From <span class="ital">this</span> connection also we may easily understand why <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἵμ</span>., which moreover, following <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>, was a matter of course, is added at all; though in itself unnecessary and self-evident, it is added with all the more weight, and in fact with solemn emphasis. For just in the blood of Christ, which God has not spared, lies the proof of His righteousness, which He has exhibited through the setting forth of Christ as an expiatory-sacrifice; that shed blood has at once satisfied His justice, and demonstrated it before the whole world. On the <span class="ital">atoning</span>, actually <span class="ital">sin-effacing</span> power of the blood of Christ, according to the fundamental idea of <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a> (compare <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>), see <a href="/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a> f. But the question whether the word <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> involves of itself a reference to the cost at which the thing is accomplished is after all of minor consequence: that cost is brought out unambiguously in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>. The <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> is in Christ Jesus, and it is in Him as One whom God set forth in propitiatory power, through faith (<span class="ital">or</span>, reading <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως</span>, through the faith referred to), in His blood. <span class="greekheb">προέθετο</span> in <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>) is “purposed”; but here the other meaning, “set forth” (Vulg. <span class="ital">proposuit</span>) suits the context much better. <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> has been taken in various ways. (1) In the LXX it is the rendering of <span class="greekheb">כַּפֹּרֶת</span>, (A.V.) “mercy-seat”. If one passage at least, <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">כַּפֹּרֶת</span> is rendered <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον ἐπίθεμα</span>, which is possibly a combination of two translations—a literal one, a “lid” or “covering”; and a figurative or spiritual one, “a propitiatory”. Many scholars argue that Paul’s use must follow that of the LXX, familiarity with which on the part of his readers is everywhere assumed. But the necessity is not quite apparent; and not to mention the incongruities which are introduced if Jesus is conceived as the mercy-seat upon which the sacrificial blood—His own blood—is sprinkled, there are grammatical reasons against this rendering. Paul must have written, to be clear, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱλαστήριον ἡ μ ῶ ν</span>, or some equivalent phrase. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1 Corinthians 5:8</a> (Christ <span class="ital">our</span> passover). A “mercy-seat” is not such a self-evident, self-interpreting idea, that the Apostle could lay it at the heart of his gospel without a word of explanation. Consequently (2) many take <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> as an adjective. Of those who so take it, some supply <span class="greekheb">θῦμα</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἱερεῖον</span>, making the idea of sacrifice explicit. But it is simpler, and there is no valid objection, to make it masculine, in agreement with <span class="greekheb">ὃν</span>: “whom God set forth in propitiatory power”. This use of the word is sufficiently guaranteed by Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xvi. 7, 1: <span class="greekheb">περίφοβος δʼ αὐτὸς ἐξῄει καὶ τοῦ δέους ἱλαστήριον μνῆυα</span> … <span class="greekheb">κατεσκευάσατο</span>. The passage in 4Ma 17:22 (<span class="greekheb">καὶ διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τῶν εὐσεβῶν ἐκείνων καὶ τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου</span> [<span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">θανάτου αὐτῶν ἡ θεία πρόνοια τὸν Ἰσραὴλ προκακωθέντα διέσωσεν</span>) is indecisive, owing to the doubtful reading. Perhaps the grammatical question is insoluble; but there is no question that Christ is conceived as endued with propitiatory power, in virtue of His death. He is set forth as <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριος</span>(<span class="greekheb">ν</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ αἵματι</span>. It is His blood that covers sin. It seems a mere whim of rigour to deny, as Weiss does, that the death of Christ is here conceived as sacrificial. It is in His blood that Christ is endued with propitiatory power; and there is no propitiatory power of blood known to Scripture unless the blood be that of sacrifice. It is not necessary to assume that any particular sacrifice—say the sin offering—is in view; neither is it necessary, in order to find the idea of sacrifice here, to make <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> neuter, and supply <span class="greekheb">θῦμα</span>; it is enough to say that for the Apostle the ideas of blood with propitiatory virtue, and sacrificial blood, must have been the same. The precise connection and purpose of <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῆς</span>) <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span> is not at once clear. Grammatically, it might be construed with <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ αἴματι</span>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a> (?), <a href="/mark/1-15.htm" title="And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.">Mark 1:15</a>; but this lessens the emphasis due to the last words. It seems to be inserted, almost parenthetically, to resume and continue the idea of <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>, that the righteousness of God which comes in this way,—namely, in Christ, whom God has set forth in propitiatory power in virtue of His death—comes only to those who believe. Men are saved freely, and it is all God’s work, not in the very least their own; yet that work does not avail for any one who does not by faith accepts it. What God has given to the world in Christ, infinitely great and absolutely free as it is, is literally nothing unless it is taken. Faith must have its place, therefore, in the profoundest statement of the Gospel, as the correlative of grace. Thus <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῆς</span>) <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>, though parenthetic, is of the last importance. With <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. we are shown God’s purpose in setting forth Christ as a propitiation in His blood. It is done with a view to demonstrate His righteousness, owing to the passing by of the sins previously committed in the forbearance of God. God’s righteousness in this place is obviously an attribute of God, on which the sin of the world, as hitherto treated by Him, has cast a shadow. Up till now, God has “passed by” sin. He has “winked at” (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>) the transgressions of men perpetrated before Christ came (<span class="greekheb">προ</span>-<span class="greekheb">γεγονότων</span>), <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἀνοχῇ αὐτοῦ</span>. The last words may be either temporal or causal: while God exercised forbearance, or because He exercised it, men sinned, so to speak, with impunity, and God’s character was compromised. The underlying thought is the same as in <a href="/psalms/50-21.htm" title="These things have you done, and I kept silence; you thought that I was altogether such an one as yourself: but I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.">Psalm 50:21</a> : “These things hast Thou done, and I kept silence: <span class="ital">Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as Thyself</span>”. Such had been the course of Providence that God, owing to His forbearance in suspending serious dealing with sin, lay under the imputation of being indifferent to it.” But the time had now come to remove this imputation, and vindicate the Divine character. If it was possible once, it was no longer possible now, with Christ set forth in His Blood as a propitiation, to maintain that sin was a thing which God regarded with indifference, Paul does not say in so many words what it is in Christ crucified which constitutes Him a propitiation, and so clears God’s character of the charge that He does not care for sin: He lays stress, however, on the fact that an essential element in a propitiation is that it should vindicate the Divine righteousness. It should proclaim with unmistakable clearness that with sin God can hold no terms. (The distinction between <span class="greekheb">πάρεσις</span>, the suspension, and <span class="greekheb">ἄφεσις</span>, the revocation, of punishment, is borne out, according to Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Notes on Epp. of St. Paul</span>, p. 273, by classical usage, and is essential here.) In <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a> this idea is restated, and the significance of a propitiation more fully brought out. “Yes, God set Him forth in this character with a view to demonstrate His righteousness, that He might be righteous Himself, and accept as righteous him who believes in “Jesus.” The words <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ</span> refer to the Gospel Age, the time in which believers live, in contrast to the time when God exercised forbearance, and men were tempted to accuse Him of indifference to righteousness. <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span>, as distinguished from <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, makes us think rather of the person contemplating the end than of the end contemplated; but there is no essential difference. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἔνδειξιν</span>: the article means “the <span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span> already mentioned in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>”. But the last clause, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is the most important. It makes explicit the whole intention of God in dealing with sin by means of a propitiation. God’s righteousness, compromised as it seemed by His for bearance, might have been vindicated in another way; if He had executed judgment upon sin, it would have been a kind of vindication. He would have secured the first object of <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a> : “that He might be righteous Himself”. But part of God’s object was to justify the ungodly (chap. <a href="/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>), upon certain conditions; and <span class="ital">this</span> could not be attained by the execution of judgment upon sin. To combine both objects, and at once vindicate His own righteousness, and put righteousness within reach of the sinful, it was necessary that instead of executing judgment God should provide a propitiation. This He did when He set forth Jesus in His blood for the acceptance of faith. (Häring takes the <span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span> of God’s righteousness here to be the same as the “revelation” of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ</span> in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, or the “manifestation” of it in <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>; but this is only possible if with him we completely ignore the context, and especially the decisive words, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν πάρεσιν τῶν προγεγονότων ἁμαρτημάτων</span>.) The question has been raised whether the righteousness of God, here spoken of as demonstrated at the Cross, is His judicial (Weiss) or His penal righteousness (Meyer). This seems to me an unreal question; the righteousness of God is the whole character of God so far as it must be conceived as inconsistent with any indifference about sin. It is a more serious question if we ask what it is in Christ set forth by God in His blood which at once vindicates God’s character and makes it possible for Him to justify those who believe. The passage itself contains nothing explicit—except in the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ αἵματι</span>. It is pedantic and inept to argue that since God could have demonstrated His righteousness <span class="ital">either</span> by punishment <span class="ital">or</span> by propitiation, therefore punishment and propitiation have no relation to each other. Christ was a propitiation <span class="ital">in virtue of His death</span>; and however a modern mind may construe it, <span class="ital">death</span> to Paul <span class="ital">was the doom of sin</span>. To say that God set forth Christ as a propitiation <span class="ital">in His blood</span> is the same thing as to say that God <span class="ital">made Him to be sin</span> for us. God’s righteousness, therefore, is demonstrated at the Cross, because there, in Christ’s death, it is made once for all apparent that He does not palter with sin; the doom of sin falls by His appointment on the Redeemer. And it is possible, at the same time, to accept as righteous those who by faith unite themselves to Christ upon the Cross, and identify themselves with Him in His death: for in doing so they submit in Him to the Divine sentence upon sin, and at bottom become right with God. It is misleading to render <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν δίκαιον κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦντα</span>, that He might be just and <span class="ital">yet</span> the justifier,” etc.: the Apostle only means that the two ends have equally to be secured, not that there is necessarily an antagonism between them. But it is more than misleading to render “that He might be just <span class="ital">and therefore</span> the justifier”: there is no conception of righteousness, capable of being clearly carried out, <span class="ital">and connected with the Cross</span>, which makes such language intelligible. (See Dorner, <span class="ital">System of Christian Doctrine</span>, iv., 14, English Translation.) It is the love of God, according to the consistent teaching of the New Testament, which provides the propitiation, by which God’s righteousness is vindicated and the justification of the ungodly made possible. <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἐκ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ</span> is every one who is properly and sufficiently characterised as a believer in Jesus. There is no difficulty whatever in regarding <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span> as objective genitive, as the use of <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> throughout the N.T. (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>) requires us to do: such expressions as <span class="greekheb">τῷ ἐκ πίστεως Ἀβραάμ</span> (<a href="/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,">Romans 4:16</a>) are not in the least a reason to the contrary: they only illustrate the flexibility of the Greek language.

V. has “propitiation,” the Gr. has another but cognate word.) The translation “Mercy-seat” is insisted on here by many commentators, and it is a fact on their side that in the LXX. the Gr. word is always used <span class="ital">locally</span>, of the Mercy-seat, or the like. But on the other side are the facts (1) that the word, as to its <span class="ital">form</span>, can quite well mean <span class="bld">a price of expiation;</span> (2) that it is found, though very rarely, in that sense in secular Greek; and above all (3) that the context here is strongly in favour of the sense “an expiatory offering.” He <span class="ital">becomes</span> “a propitiation” to the soul “<span class="ital">through faith in His blood;</span>” an expression which naturally points to the Victim, not the Mercy-seat, as the type in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through faith</span>] This, as always in the Scripture doctrine of salvation, is the necessary <span class="ital">medium of application</span>. In <span class="ital">Himself</span> the Saviour is what He is, always and absolutely; to <span class="ital">the soul</span> He is what He is, as Saviour, only when approached by faith; i.e. accepted, in humble trust in the Divine word, as the sole way of mercy.

The Redeemer’s expiatory death, and the gift of pardon solely “through faith in” it, <span class="ital">explained</span> beyond all doubt that the Divine mercy <span class="ital">did not mean indifference to the Divine Law</span>. Many questions regarding the atonement may be beyond our knowledge; but this at least is “declared,” as the sinful soul contemplates it.—Here, probably, the phrase “Righteousness of God” bears a sense (suggested in the note) exceptional to the rule given in note on <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>.

Almost every word here needs special notice. “<span class="ital">Letting-pass:</span>”—a word weaker than full and free pardon, and thus specially appropriate to God’s dealings with sin <span class="ital">before the Gospel</span>, when there was just this <span class="ital">reserve</span> about the forgiveness, that the Reason of it was not fully revealed.—“<span class="ital">Fore-gone</span>, or <span class="ital">fore-done, sins:</span>”—i.e., those before the Gospel.

Of salach, to bear away as a burden, <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a> : A.V., forgive, pardon. It is used with the accusative (direct objective) case, marking the sin, or with the dative (indirect objective), as be conciliated to our sins.<p>&#x395;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; mostly represents kipher to cover, and is more common than the simple verb. Thus, purge the altar, <a href="/ezekiel/43-26.htm">Ezekiel 43:26</a>; cleanse the sanctuary, <a href="/ezekiel/45-20.htm">Ezekiel 45:20</a>; reconcile the house, <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>. It is found with the accusative case of that which is cleansed; with the preposition &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769; concerning, as "for your sin," <a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a>; with the preposition &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1; on behalf of A.V., for, <a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>; absolutely, to make an atonement, <a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>; with the preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; from, as "cleansed from the blood," <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>. There are but two instances of the accusative of the person propitiated: appease him, <a href="/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>; pray before (propitiate) the Lord, <a href="/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>.<p>&#x399;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, A.V., propitiation, is almost always used in the Old Testament of the mercy-seat or golden cover of the ark, and this is its meaning in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>, the only other passage of the New Testament in which it is found. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-14.htm">Ezekiel 43:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-17.htm">Ezekiel 43:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-20.htm">Ezekiel 43:20</a>, it means a ledge round a large altar, and is rendered settle in A.V.; Rev., ledge, in margin.<p>This term has been unduly pressed into the sense of explanatory sacrifice. In the case of the kindred verbs, the dominant Old-Testament sense is not propitiation in the sense of something offered to placate or appease anger; but atonement or reconciliation, through the covering, and so getting rid of the sin which stands between God and man. The thrust of the idea is upon the sin or uncleanness, not upon the offended party. Hence the frequent interchange with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9; to sanctify, and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9; to cleanse. See <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-26.htm">Ezekiel 43:26</a>, where &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; shall purge, and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; shall purify, are used coordinately. See also <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>, of the altar of incense: "Aaron shall make an atonement (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) upon the horns of it - with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement" (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; purification). Compare <a href="/leviticus/16-20.htm">Leviticus 16:20</a>. The Hebrew terms are also used coordinately.<p>Our translators frequently render the verb kaphar by reconcile, <a href="/leviticus/6-30.htm">Leviticus 6:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-20.htm">Leviticus 16:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-20.htm">Ezekiel 45:20</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>, Moses put blood upon the horns of the altar and cleansed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;) the altar, and sanctified (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) it, to make reconciliation (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) upon it.

As applied to an altar or to the walls of a house (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-48.htm">Leviticus 14:48-53</a>), this idea could have no force, because these inanimate things, though ceremonially unclean, could have no sin to be expiated. Moses, when he went up to make atonement for the idolatry at Sinai, offered no sacrifice, but only intercession. See also the case of Korah, <a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46</a>; the cleansing of leprosy and of mothers after childbirth, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1-20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-7.htm">Leviticus 12:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-30.htm">Leviticus 15:30</a>; the reformation of Josiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>; the fasting and confession of Ezra, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1-15</a>; the offering of the Israelite army after the defeat of Midian. They brought bracelets, rings, etc., to make an atonement (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) before the Lord; not expiatory, but a memorial, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50-54</a>. The Passover was in no sense expiatory; but Paul says, "Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us; therefore purge out (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;) the old leaven. Let us keep the feast with sincerity and truth;" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>.<p>In the Old Testament the idea of sacrifice as in itself a propitiation continually recedes before that of the personal character lying back of sacrifice, and which alone gives virtue to it. See <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-14</a>, <a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>. This idea does not recede in the Old Testament to be reemphasized in the New. On the contrary, the New Testament emphasizes the recession, and lays the stress upon the cleansing and life-giving effect of the sacrifice of Christ. See <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10-13</a>.<p>The true meaning of the offering of Christ concentrates, therefore, not upon divine justice, but upon human character; not upon the remission of penalty for a consideration, but upon the deliverance from penalty through moral transformation; not upon satisfying divine justice, but upon bringing estranged man into harmony with God. As Canon Westcott remarks: "The scripture conception of &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is not that of appeasing one who is angry with a personal feeling against the offender, but of altering the character of that which, from without, occasions a necessary alienation, and interposes an inevitable obstacle to fellowship" (Commentary on St. John's Epistles, p. 85).<p>continued...</body></html>
