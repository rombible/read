Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is he the God ... - The Jews supposed that he was the God of their nation only, that they only were to be admitted to his favor.

Unsuitable, especially for the important closing thought, is the view of Calvin, followed by Jatho, that there is an irony in the difference: “Si quis vult habere differentiam gentilis a Judaeo, hanc habeat, quod ille <span class="ital">per</span> fidem, hic vero <span class="ital">ex</span> fide justitiam consequitur.” Theodore of Mopsuestia, Wetstein, Bengel, Hofmann, and others explain it by various other gratuitous suggestions;[931] van Hengel is doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The interchange of <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΠΊΣΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (<span class="ital">from faith—through the faith</span>), in which the <span class="ital">qualitative</span> expression advances to <span class="ital">the concrete with the article</span>, is also without special design, as similar accidental interchanges often occur in parallel clauses (Winer, p. 110 [E. T. 149]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[929] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[931] Bengel: “Judaei pridem in fide fuerant; gentiles fidem ab illis recens nacti erant.” Comp. Origen. Similarly Matthias: in the case of the circumcised faith appears as the <span class="ital">ground</span>, in that of the uncircumcised as the <span class="ital">means</span> of justification; <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστ</span>. signifies: <span class="ital">because</span> they believe, <span class="greekheb">διά τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστ</span>.: <span class="ital">if</span> they believe. In the case of the circumcised faith is presupposed as covenant-faithfulness. Comp. also Bisping. According to Hofmann, Paul is supposed to have said in the case of the circumcised <span class="ital">in consequence of faith</span>, because these wish to become righteous in consequence of legal works; but in the case of the uncircumcised <span class="ital">by means of</span> faith, because with the latter no other possible way of becoming righteous was conceivable. In the former instance faith is the preceding condition; in the latter the faith existing for the purpose of justification (therefore accompanied by the article) is the means, by which God, who works it, helps to righteousness. This amounts to a subjective invention of subtleties which are equally incapable of proof as of refutation, but which are all the more groundless, seeing that Paul is fond of such interchanges of prepositions in setting forth the same relation (comp. ver. 25 f., and on <a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>). How frequent are similar interchanges also in classic authors! Moreover, in our passage the stress is by no means on the prepositions (Hofmann), but on <span class="greekheb">περιτομήν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀκροβυστίαν</span>. And as to the variation of the prepositions, Augustine has properly observed (<span class="ital">de Spir. et lit.</span> 29) that this interchange serves <span class="ital">non ad aliquam differentiam</span>, but <span class="ital">ad varietatem locutionis</span>.

It is not that of <span class="accented">numerical</span> unity, but what may be called the unity of <span class="accented">quality</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere assertion of monotheism as against polytheism, but that the one God is one and the same to all, comprehending all in the embrace of his own essential unity. God's unity involved in St. Paul's mind the idea of "One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him" (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>); "who made of one blood every nation of men" (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>); in whom we (all of us) "live and move and have our being" (<a href="/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). Thus exclusion of the Gentiles from the paternal embrace of the one God is incompatible with the very idea, so conceived, of his unity. In the latter part of this verse it is said that God will justify the circumcision <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the uncircumcision <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the preposition being changed, and the second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> being preceded by the article. The difference is not of essential importance, "faith" being the emphatic word. But it is not unmeaning. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;</span> expresses the principle of justification; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, the medium through which it may be had. The Jew was already in a position for justification through the Law leading up to Christ. He had only to accept it as <span class="accented">of faith</span>, and not <span class="accented">of works of law</span> (ver. 20). The Gentile must attain to it <span class="accented">through faith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his faith in the gospel now revealed to him. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (Theodorus). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By faith - through faith (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;  - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;)<p>Some make the two prepositions equivalent. The difference may be explained from the fact that the real Jew has already a germinating faith from the completion of which justification arises as fruit from a tree. So Wordsworth: "The Jews are justified out of (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;) the faith which their father Abraham had, and which they are supposed to have in him The Gentiles must enter that door and pass through it in order to be justified."
