This is made plain by several passages of Scripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt and depraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great as our advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselves Christians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear of God before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to be looked for.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As it is written - The apostle is reasoning with Jews; and he proceeds to show from their own Scriptures, that what he had affirmed was true. The point to be proved was, that the Jews, in the matter of justification, had no advantage or preference over the Gentiles; that the Jew had failed to keep the Law which had been given him, as the Gentile had failed to keep the Law which had been given him; and that both, therefore, were equally dependent on the mercy of God, incapable of being justified and saved by their works. To show this, the apostle adduces texts to show what was the character of the Jewish people; or to show that according to their own Scriptures, they were sinners no less than the Gentiles. The point, then, is to prove the depravity of the Jews, not that of universal depravity. The interpretation should be confined to the bearing of the passages on the Jews, and the quotations should not be adduced as directly proving the doctrine of universal depravity. In a certain sense, which will be stated soon, they may be adduced as bearing on that subject. But their direct reference is to the Jewish nation. The passages which follow, are taken from various parts of the Old Testament. The design of this is to show, that this characteristic of sin was not confined to any particular period of the Jewish history, but pertained to them as a people; that it had characterised them throughout their existence as a nation. Most of the passages are quoted in the language of the Septuagint. The quotation in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>, is from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-3</a>; and from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/53-1.htm">Psalm 53:1-3</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/53-1.htm">Psalm 53:1-6</a> is the same as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a>, with some slight variations.<p>(Yet if we consult <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/53-1.htm">Psalm 53:1-6</a>, from which the quotations in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a> are taken, we shall be constrained to admit that their original application is nothing short of universal. The Lord is represented as looking down from heaven, (not upon the Jewish people only, but upon the "children of men" at large, "to see if there were any that did understand and seek God);" and declaring, as the result of his unerring scrutiny, "there is "none" that doeth good, no, not one."<p>That the apostle applies the passages to the case of the Jews is admitted, yet it is evident more is contained in them than the single proof of Jewish depravity. They go all the length of proving the depravity of mankind, and are cited expressly with this view. "We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles," says Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9</a>, "that they are all under sin." Immediately on this, the quotations in question are introduced with the usual formula, "as it is written," etc. Now since the apostle adduces his Scripture proofs, to establish the doctrine that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin," we cannot reasonably decide against him by confining their application to the Jews only.<p>In <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a> Paul brings his argument to bear directly on the Jews. That they might not elude his aim, by interpreting the universal expressions he had introduced, of all the pagan only, leaving themselves favorably excepted; he reminds them that" whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to them that were under it." Not contented with having placed them alongside of the Gentiles in <a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9</a>; by this second application of the general doctrine of human depravity, to their particular case, he renders escape or evasion impossible. The scope of the whole passage then, is, that all people are depraved, and that the Jews form no exception. This view is further strengthened by the apostle's conclusion in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>. "Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his (God's) sight."<p>"If the words," says President Edwards, "which the apostle uses, do not most fully and determinately signify an universality, no words ever used in the Bible are sufficient to do it. I might challenge any man to produce any one paragraph in the scriptures, from the beginning to the end, where there is such a repetition and accumulation of terms, so strongly, and emphatically, and carefully, to express the most perfect and absolute universality, or any place to be compared to it." - "Edwards on Original Sin, - Haldane's Commentary."<p>There is none righteous - The Hebrew Psa 14:1 is, there is none that doeth good. The Septuagint has the same. The apostle quotes according to the sense of the passage. The design of the apostle is to show that none could be justified by the Law. He uses an expression, therefore, which is exactly conformable to his argument, and which accords in meaning with the Hebrew, "there is none just," &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  dikaios.<p>No, not one - This is not in the Hebrew, but is in the Septuagint. It is a strong universal expression, denoting the state of almost universal corruption which existed in the time of the psalmist. The expression should not be interpreted to mean that there was not literally "one pious man" in the nation; but that the characteristic of the nation was, at that time, that it was exceedingly corrupt. Instead of being righteous, as the Jew claimed, because they were Jews, the testimony of their own Scriptures was, that they were universally wicked.<p>(The design of the apostle, however, is not to prove that there were few or none pious. He is treating of the impossibility of justification by works, and alleges in proof that, according to the judgment of God in the <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a> Psalm, there were none righteous, etc., in regard to their natural estate, or the condition in which man is, previous to his being justified. In this condition, all are deficient in righteousness, and have nothing to commend them to the divine favor. What people may afterward become by grace is another question, on which the apostle does not, in this place, enter. Whatever number of pious people, therefore, there might be in various places of the world, the argument of the apostle is not in the least affected. It will hold good even in the millennium!) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-12. As it is written, &c.&#8212;(Ps 14:1-3; 53:1-3).

The long series of quotations, beginning with this verse, has many points of interest. The <span class="greekheb">καθὼς γέγραπται</span> with which it is introduced, shows that the assertion of indiscriminate sinfulness which the Apostle has just made, corresponds with Scripture testimony. It is as if he had said, I can express my opinion in inspired words, and therefore it has God upon its side. The quotations themselves are taken from various parts of the O.T. without distinction; no indication is given when the writer passes from one book to another. Thus <a href="/context/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:...">Romans 3:10-12</a> are from <a href="/context/psalms/14-1.htm" title="The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.

No attention whatever is paid to the context. The value of the quotations for the Apostle’s purpose has been disputed. It has been pointed out that in Psalms 14, for instance, there is mention of a people of God, “a generation of the righteous,” as well as of the godless world; and that in other passages only the contemporaries of the writer, or some of them, and not all men in all times, are described. Perhaps if we admit that there is no possibility of an empirical proof of the universality of sin, it covers the truth there is in such comments. Paul does not rest his case on these words of Scripture, interpreted as modern exegetical science would interpret them. He has brought the charge of sin against all men in chap. <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, in announcing righteousness as the gift of the Gospel; in chap. <a href="/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;...">Romans 1:18-32</a> he has referred to the facts which bring the charge home to Gentile consciences; in chap. 2 he has come to close quarters with evasions which would naturally suggest themselves to Jews: and in both cases he has counted upon finding in conscience a sure ally. Hence we do not need to lay too heavy a burden of proof on these quotations: it is enough if they show that Scripture points with unmistakable emphasis in the direction in which the Apostle is leading his readers. And there can be no doubt that it does so. As Gifford well says on <a href="/romans/3-18.htm" title="There is no fear of God before their eyes.">Romans 3:18</a> : “In the deep inner sense which St. Paul gives to the passage, ‘the generation of the righteous’ would be the first to acknowledge that they form no exception to the universal sinfulness asserted in the opening verses of the Psalm”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">There is none</span>, &c.] In <a href="/context/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:...">Romans 3:10-18</a> we have a chain of Scripture quotations. The originals are found, verbally or in substance, in <a href="/psalms/5-9.htm" title="For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-7.htm" title="His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.">Psalm 10:7</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/14-1.htm" title="The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.

In the Alexandrine MS. of the LXX. of Psalms 14 (LXX. 13):3, appears a singular phenomenon: the Gr. is much ampler than the original Hebrew (for Which see E. V.), and is verbatim the same as the Gr. of <a href="/context/romans/3-12.htm" title="They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one....">Romans 3:12-18</a> of this chapter. There can be little doubt that this was the work of a copyist acquainted with this passage of St Paul.—<a href="/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:">Romans 3:10</a> would better read: <span class="bld">as it is written that there is none righteous, no, not one</span>. The precise quotations would then begin at <a href="/romans/3-11.htm" title="There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.">Romans 3:11</a>. The words of <a href="/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:">Romans 3:10</a> are not found in the O. T., and read rather as a summary of what is to follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The awful charges of <a href="/context/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:...">Romans 3:10-18</a> are specially pointed at the Jews: see <a href="/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>. The passages quoted are descriptive of Israelites, some of them of Israelites of the best days of Israel. What <span class="ital">at least</span> they establish is that the root of sin was vigorous in Jewish hearts, and that its fruits in Jewish lives were abominable in the sight of God. Meantime we must not narrow the reference too closely. The Apostle’s doctrine of human sinfulness (see e.g. <a href="/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>) is that the worst developments of individual sin only indicate the <span class="ital">possibilities of the sinful heart in general</span>. Passages like those cited here thus prove, not only what certain men were, but what man is. See <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm" title="The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?">Jeremiah 17:9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:">Romans 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθως</span>, <span class="ital">as</span>) That all men are under sin, is very clearly proved from the vices which always, and everywhere, have been prevalent [have stalked abroad] among mankind; just as, also, the internal holiness of Christ is displayed in [pourtratyed by means of] the innocency of His words and actions. Paul therefore quotes, with propriety, David and Isaiah, although it is concerning the people of their own times that they complain, and that accompanied with an exception in favour of the godly [some of whom are always to be found], <a href="/psalms/14-4.htm" title="Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not on the LORD.">Psalm 14:4</a>, etc. For that complaint describes men such as God looking down from heaven finds them to be, not such as He makes them by His grace.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

These texts are from various unconnected passages of the Old Testament, quoted from the LXX., though not all accurately. They seem to be put together from memory by way of showing the general scriptural view of human depravity. It may be said that they do not establish the apostle's position of <span class="accented">all</span> men being guilty; for that they are for the most part rhetorical rather than dogmatic, that most of them refer only to certain classes of men, and that the righteous are spoken of too, and this in the sequence of even the most sweeping of them all (that from <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. or Psalms 53.), which does, literally understood, assert universal sinfulness. Any such objection to the cogency of the quotations may be met by regarding them as adduced, not as rigid proofs, but as only generally confirmatory of the apostle's position. See, he would say to the Jew, the picture your own Scriptures give you; observe their continued testimony to human depravity: and the main point of all the quotations is that which is brought out in the next verse, viz. that they had reference, not to the Gentile world, but to the chosen people themselves. </body></html>
