This, again, is characteristic of his ardent and keenly speculative mind. Problems such as those which he discusses evidently have a fascination for him, and lead him, here as elsewhere, at once to leave the immediate subject before him, and to enter eagerly into the discussion of them. A more lethargic or timid brain would be under no such temptation.<p>One real and solid advantage on the part of the Jew was that he was made the direct recipient of the divine revelation. This privilege of his is not annulled by the defection of a part of the people. It rests not upon the precarious fidelity of men, but upon the infallible promise of God. Yet is not the ultimate triumph of that promise any excuse for those who have set it at nought. They will be punished just the same, and rightly. Otherwise there could be no judgment at all. The casuistical objection that sin loses its guilt if it redounds to God’s glory, or, in other words, that the end justifies the means, carries with it its own condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?...">Romans 3:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">What advantage then hath the Jew? — </span>The foregoing reasonings being contrary to the prejudices of the Jews, one of that nation is here introduced objecting, If our being the children of Abraham, members of the church of God, and heirs of the promises, will procure us no favour at the judgment, — and if the want of these privileges will not preclude the heathen from salvation; — or, If it be so that God looks only at the heart, and does not regard persons for their external privileges, what is the pre-eminence of a Jew above a Gentile, and, (for there are two questions here asked,) <span class="ital">what profit is there of circumcision </span>— And of the other ritual services which are enjoined in the law?

This prerogative Paul here singles out, by which, after removing the objection, he convicts them so much the more. “The Greeks used the word <span class="greekheb">λογια</span>, <span class="ital">oracles, </span>to denote the responses which their deities, or rather their priests, made to those who consulted them, especially if they were delivered in prose: for, as Beza observes, they gave a different name, <span class="greekheb">χρησμοι</span>, to such responses as were uttered in verse. Here oracles denote the whole of the <span class="ital">divine revelations; </span>and, among the rest, the law of Moses, which Stephen calls <span class="greekheb">λογια ζωντα</span>, <span class="ital">living oracles, </span><a href="/acts/7-18.htm" title="Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.">Acts 7:18</a>, because God spake that law in person.

Now, this being the chief of all their advantages, as Jews, it alone is mentioned here by the apostle. In like manner, the psalmist has mentioned the word of God as the distinguishing privilege of the Israelites, <a href="/psalms/147-19.htm" title="He shows his word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to Israel.">Psalm 147:19</a>, <span class="ital">He hath showed his word unto Jacob, </span>&c. <span class="ital">He hath not dealt so with any nation. </span>The benefits which the Jews derived from the oracles of God, the apostle had no occasion to explain here, because they were all introduced in the boasting of the Jew, described <a href="/context/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,...">Romans 2:17-23</a>.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What advantage ... - The design of the first part of this chapter is to answer some of the objections which might be offered by a Jew to the statements in the last chapter. The first objection is stated in this verse. A Jew would naturally ask, if the view which the apostle had given were correct, what special benefit could the Jew derive from his religion? The objection would arise particularly from the position advanced <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25-26</a>, that if a pagan should do the things required by the Law, he would be treated as "if" he had been circumcised.

If he is not properly a Jew, who is born of Jewish parents, and brought up in the customs, rites, and religion of the Jewish nation, but anyone of whatsoever nation, that is born again of water, and of the Spirit; where is the superior excellency of the Jew to the Gentile? A man may as well be born and brought up a Heathen as a Jew; the one has no more advantages than the other by his birth and education: it may be rendered, "what hath the Jew more?" or "what has he superfluous" or "abundant?" the phrase answers to the Hebrew   in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>, which is rendered, "what profit hath a man?" and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:8</a>,  , "what hath a wise man more", &amp;c. and in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11</a>,  , "what is a man better?" the first of these passages the Septuagint render by , "what abundance?" and the last by  "what more", or "superfluous", or "abundant?" the phrase used by the apostle here: <p>or what profit is there of circumcision? since that which is outward in the flesh profits not unless the law is kept, otherwise circumcision is no circumcision; and if an uncircumcised Gentile keeps the law, he is a better man than a circumcised Jew; yea, he judges and condemns him; for the only true circumcision is internal, spiritual, and in the heart.

According to Mehring Paul has written ver. 2, and in fact onward to ver. 8, as the sentiments of a Jew to be summarily dealt with, who in <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> had it in view to enumerate yet further advantages, but whose mouth was closed by ver. 9.

It might easily seem, at this point, as if the Apostle’s argument had proved too much. He has shown that the mere possession of the law does not exempt the Jew from judgment, but that God requires its fulfilment; he has shown that circumcision in the flesh, seal though it be of the covenant and pledge of its promises, is only of value if it represent inward heart circumcision; he has, it may be argued, reduced the Jew to a position of entire equality with the Gentile. But the consciousness of the Jewish race must protest against such a conclusion. “Salvation is of the Jews” is a word of Christ Himself, and the Apostle is obliged to meet this instinctive protest of the ancient people of God. The whole of the difficulties it raises are more elaborately considered in chaps. 9–11; here it is only discussed so far as to make plain that it does not invalidate the arguments of chap. 2, nor bar the development of the Apostle’s theology. The advantage of the Jew is admitted; it is admitted that his unbelief may even act as a foil to God’s faithfulness, setting it in more glorious relief; but it is insisted, that if God’s character as righteous judge of the world is to be maintained—as it must be—these admissions do not exempt the Jew from that liability to judgment which has just been demonstrated. The details of the interpretation, especially in <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> f., are somewhat perplexed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?...">Romans 3:1-2</a>.

It is remarkable that his chief reply to such a thought lies in the fact that the Old Covenant secured the immense practical benefit of <span class="ital">Revelation</span>. (Cp. <a href="/psalms/103-7.htm" title="He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.">Psalm 103:7</a>.) This correction is aside from the main argument of this part of the Epistle, in which St Paul aims to prove the equality of Jew and Gentile not in respect of privilege but in respect of <span class="ital">reality of guilt, and of need of a Divine justification</span>. Yet even here the main argument is not forgotten: the gift of Scripture brings the <span class="ital">responsibility</span> of the Jew into the fullest light. His “advantage” is his accusation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τί</span>, <span class="ital">what</span>). Paul’s usual form of bringing in an objection.—<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) <span class="ital">then</span>. Since circumcision is unprofitable without observing the law, and since being a Jew outwardly is of no avail, what advantage does the latter possess, and of what profit is the former? It therefore must follow, that the Jews have no peculiar privileges whatever. Paul denies this conclusion. There are innumerable exceptions taken against the doctrine set forth in this epistle, by the perverseness of the Jews, and of mankind at large; but Paul sweeps them all away.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ τερισσὸν</span>, <span class="ital">peculiar advantage</span>), <span class="greekheb">יתר</span>, over [as compared with] the Gentiles.

Some difficulty in determining his exact meaning arises from the concise and pregnant form in which the objections are put and answered, and from fresh ones arising out of the answers, which have also to be met. The objections are from the Jewish standpoint, though not put into the mouth of an objecting Jew, but rather suggested as likely ones by St. Paul himself. To the original readers of the Epistle, who were familiar with the tone of Jewish thought, the sequence of the ideas would probably be more obvious than to us. Reserving special consideration of successive clauses for our exposition of each verse, we may, in the first place, exhibit thus the general drift. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 1 (ver. 1). If being a Jew, if circumcision itself, gives one no advantage over the Gentile, what was the use of the old covenant at all? It is thus shown to have been illusory; and God's own truth and faithfulness are impugned, if he is supposed to have given, as conveying advantages, what really conveyed none. (This last thought, though not expressed, must be supposed to be implied in the objection, since it is replied to in the answer.) <span class="accented">Answer</span> (vers. 2-4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was not illusory; it did convey great advantages in the way of <span class="accented">privilege and opportunity</span>; this advantage first, not to mention other. that "the oracles of God" were entrusted to the Jew. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some (more or fewer, it matters not) have failed to realize these advantages, it has been their fault, not God's. It is man's unfaithfulness, not his, that has been the cause of the failure. Nay, though, according to the hasty saying of the psalmist, <span class="accented">all men</span> were false, God's truth remains; nay, further, as is expressed in another psalm (<a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.), man's very unfaithfulness is found to commend his faithfulness the more, and redound to his greater glory. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 2 (ver. 5). Based on the last assertion. But if man's unfaithfulness has this result, how can God, consistently with his justice, be wrath with us and punish us for it? Surely the Jew (whose case we are now considering) may claim exemption from "the wrath" of God spoken of above, his unfaithfulness being allowed to have served only to establish God's truth and to enhance his glory. <span class="accented">Answer</span> (ver. 6-8). I have suggested this objection as though the matter could be regarded from a mere human point of view, as though it were one between man and man; for it is true that a man cannot justly take vengeance on another who has not really harmed him. But such a view is inapplicable to God in his dealings with man; it does not touch our doctrine of his righteous wrath against sin as such. I can only meet it with a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it would preclude God from judging the world at all, as we all believe he will do. Any <span class="accented">heathen</span> sinner might put in the same plea, saying, Why am I too (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) judged as a sinner? Nay, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> since it involves the principle of sin being evil, not in itself, but only with regard to its consequences, it would, if carried out, justify the odious view (which we Christians are by some falsely accused of holding) that we may do evil that good may come. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What advantage then hath the Jew! or what is the profit of circumcision!
