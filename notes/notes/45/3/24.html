The bondage is the state of sin and of guilt, with the expectation of punishment; the deliverance is the removal of this state, and the opening out, in its stead, of a prospect of eternal happiness and glory; the equivalent paid by Christ is the shedding of His own blood. This last is the pivot upon which the whole idea of redemption turned. It is therefore clear that the redemption of the sinner is an act wrought objectively, and, in the first instance, independently of any change of condition in him, though such a change is involved in the appropriation of the efficacy of that act to himself. It cannot be explained as a purely subjective process wrought in the sinner through the influence of Christ’s death. The idea of dying and reviving with Christ, though a distinct aspect of the atonement, cannot be made to cover the whole of it. There is implied, not only a change in the recipient of the atonement, but also a change wrought without his co-operation in the relations between God and man. There is, if it may be so said, in the death of Christ something which determines the will of God, as well as something which acts upon the will of man. And the particular influence which is brought to bear upon the counsels of God is represented under the figure of a ransom or payment of an equivalent. This element is too essentially a part of the metaphor, and is too clearly established by other parallel metaphors, to be explained away; though what the terms “propitiation” and “equivalent” can mean, as applied to God, we do not know, and it perhaps does not become us too curiously to inquire.<p>The doctrine of the atonement thus stated is not peculiar to St. Paul, and did not originate with him. It is found also in the Synoptic Gospels, <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a> ( = <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>), “The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom for many,” and in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>, “And for this cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption (<span class= "ital">ransoming</span>) of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.” (Comp. <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being justified - Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law. The apostle has shown that they could not be so regarded and treated by any merit of their own, or by personal obedience to the Law. He now affirms that if they were so treated, it must be by mere favor, and as a matter not of right, but of gift. This is the essence of the gospel. And to show this, and the way in which it is done, is the main design of this Epistle. The expression here is to be understood as referring to all who are justified; <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>. The righteousness of God by faith in Jesus Christ, is "upon all who believe," who are all "justified freely by his grace."<p>Freely - &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;  do&#772;rean. This word stands opposed to what is purchased, or which is obtained by labor, or which is a matter of claim. It is a free, undeserved gift, not merited by our obedience to the Law, and not that to which we have any claim. The apostle uses the word here in reference to those who are justified. To them it is a mere undeserved gift, It does not mean that it has been obtained, however, without any price or merit from anyone, for the Lord Jesus has purchased it with his own blood, and to him it becomes a matter of justice that those who were given to him should be justified, <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>. (Greek). <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>. We have no offering to bring, and no claim.

Its root (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  lutron) properly denotes the price which is paid for a prisoner of war; the ransom, or stipulated purchase-money, which being paid, the captive is set free. The word used here is then employed to denote liberation from bondage, captivity, or evil of any kind, usually keeping up the idea of a price, or a ransom paid, in consequence of which the delivery is effected. It is sometimes used in a large sense, to denote simple deliverance by any means, without reference to a price paid, as in <a href="/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>. That this is not the sense here, however, is apparent. For the apostle in the next verse proceeds to specify the price which has been paid, or the means by which this redemption has been effected. The word here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation; <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.<p>That is in Christ Jesus - Or, that has been effected by Christ Jesus; that of which he is the author and procurer; compare <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. justified freely&#8212;without anything done on our part to deserve.<p>by his grace&#8212;His free love.<p>through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&#8212;a most important clause; teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a "Redemption," that is, "the payment of a Ransom," in Christ's death.

The matter of justification is before expressed, and the persons that share in this blessing are described; here the several causes of it are mentioned. The moving cause of it is the free grace of God; for by "the grace of God" here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him: it appears in his resolving upon the justification of his chosen ones in Christ; in fixing on the method of doing it; in setting forth and pre-ordaining Christ to be the ransom; in calling Christ to engage herein; in Christ's engaging as a surety for his people, and in the Father's sending him to bring in everlasting righteousness; in Christ's coming to do it, and in the gracious manner in which he wrought it out; in the Father's gracious acceptation, imputation, and donation of it; in the free gift of the grace of faith, to apprehend and receive it; and in the persons that partake of it, who are of themselves sinners and ungodly. The meritorious cause of justification is, <p>the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal: this is in and by Christ; he was called unto it, was sent to effect it, had a right unto it, as being the near kinsman; and was every way fit for it, being both God and man; and has by his sufferings and death obtained it: now, as all the blessings of grace come through redemption by Christ, so does this of justification, and after this manner; Christ, as a Redeemer, had the sins of his people laid on him, and they were bore by him, and took away; the sentence of the law's condemnation was executed on him, as standing in their legal place and stead; and satisfaction was made by him for all offences committed by them, which was necessary, that God might appear to be just, in justifying all them that believe: nor is this any objection or contradiction to the free grace of God, in a sinner's justification; since it was grace in God to provide, send, and part with his Son as a Redeemer, and to work out righteousness; it was grace in Christ, to come and give himself a sacrifice, and obtain salvation and righteousness, not for angels, but for men, and for some of them, and not all; and whatever this righteousness, salvation, and redemption cost Christ, they are all free to men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Being justified <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</span><p>(9) Therefore this righteousness which we gain is altogether freely given, for its foundation is upon those things which we have not done ourselves, but rather those things which Christ has suffered for our sakes, to deliver us from sin.<p>(u) By his free gift, and liberality.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δικαιούμενοι</span>] does not stand for the finite tense (as even Rückert and Reiche, following Erasmus, Calvin and Melancthon, think); nor is, with Ewald, <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> to be treated as a parenthesis, so that the discourse from the accusative in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a> should now resolve itself more freely into the nominative, which would be unnecessarily harsh.

If we force a connection with what immediately precedes, we may say with Lipsius that just as Paul has proved the universality of grace through the universality of sin, so here, conversely, he proves the universal absence of merit in men by showing that they are justified freely by God’s grace. Westcott and Hort’s punctuation (comma after <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>) favours this connection, but it is forced and fanciful. In sense <span class="greekheb">δικαιούμενοι</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">πάντας τοὺς πιστεύοντας</span>, and the use of the nominative to resume the main idea after an interruption like that of <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> is rather characteristic than otherwise of the Apostle. <span class="greekheb">δωρεὰν</span> is used in a similar connection in <a href="/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>. It signifies “for nothing”. Justification, we are told here, costs the sinner nothing; in Galatians we are told that if it comes through law, then Christ died “for nothing”. Christ is all in it (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>): hence its absolute freeness. <span class="greekheb">τῇ αὐτοῦ χάριτι</span> repeats the same thing: as <span class="greekheb">δωρεὰν</span> signifies that we contribute nothing, <span class="greekheb">τῇ αὐτοῦ χάριτι</span> signifies that the whole charge is freely supplied by God. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> in this position has a certain emphasis. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως τῆς ἐν Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. The justification of the sinful, or the coming to them of that righteousness of God which is manifested in the Gospel, takes effect through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. Perhaps “liberation” would be a fairer word than “redemption” to translate <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span>. In <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-14.htm" title=" In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:">Colossians 1:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>, it is equal to forgiveness. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπολύτρωσις</span> itself is rare; in the LXX there is but one instance, <a href="/daniel/4-29.htm" title="At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.">Daniel 4:29</a>, in which <span class="greekheb">ὁ χρόνος μου τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως</span> signifies the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s recovery from his madness. There is here no suggestion of price or cost. Neither is there in the common use of the verb <span class="greekheb">λυτροῦσθαι</span>, which in LXX represents <span class="greekheb">גָּאַל</span> and <span class="greekheb">פָּדָה</span>, the words employed to describe God’s liberation of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.">Isaiah 43:3</a> does not count). On the other hand, the classical examples favour the idea that a reference to the cost of liberation is involved in the word. Thus Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xii. 2, 3: <span class="greekheb">πλειόνων δὲ ἢ τετρακοσίων ταλάντων τὰ τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως γενήσεσθαι φαμένων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; and Philo, <span class="ital">Quod omnis probus liber</span>, § 17 (of a Spartan boy taken prisoner in war) <span class="greekheb">ἀπογνοὺς ἀπολύτρωσιν ἄσμενος ἑαυτὸν διεχρήσατο</span>, where it is at least most natural to translate “having given up hope of being held to ransom”. In the N.T., too, the cost of man’s liberation is often emphasised: <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a> f., and that especially where the cognate words <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀντίλυτρον</span> are employed: <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1 Timothy 2:6</a>. The idea of liberation as the end in view may often have prevailed over that of the particular means employed, but that some means—and especially some cost, toil or sacrifice—were involved, was always understood. It is implied in the use of the word here that justification is a liberation; the man who receives the righteousness of God is set free by it from some condition of bondage or peril. From what? The answer is to be sought in the connection of <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a> and <a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a> : he is set free from a condition in which he was exposed to the wrath of God revealed from heaven against sin.

The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) here used may indeed sometimes denote <span class="accented">deliverance</span> only (cf. <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>); but certainly, when used of the redemption of man by Christ, it implies <span class="accented">atonement</span> by the payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; the ransom paid being said to be <span class="accented">himself</span>, or (as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="accented">his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It does not follow that all conceptions of schools of theology as to how the atonement was efficacious for its purpose are correct or adequate. It must, from the very nature of the subject, remain to us a mystery. It may be enough for us to believe that whatever need the human conscience has ever felt of atonement for sin, whatever human want was expressed by world-wide rites of sacrifice, whatever especially was signified by the blood required for atonement in the Mosaic ritual, - all this is met and fulfilled for us in Christ's offering of himself, and that in him and through him we may now "come boldly to the throne of grace," having need of no other <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x2e;</span> 25 ("set forth," Authorized Version), may bear here its most usual classical sense of <span class="accented">exhibiting to view</span> ("ante omniam oculos possuit," Bengel); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the historical manifestation of the Redeemer. It may, however, mean "decreed," or "purposed" (cf. ch. 1:13; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems best taken as a neuter adjective used substantively, there being no instance of its application in the masculine to a person. Its ordinary use in the LXX (as also <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) is to designate the lid of the ark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy-seat), the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (which is added <a href="/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6</a>) being supposed to be always understood, though the usual designation is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Hence most commentators, including the Greek Fathers generally, understood <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in this sense here, Christ being regarded as the antitype of the mercy-seat, as being the medium of atonement and approach to God. The main objection to this view is that it involves an awkward confusion of metaphors, it being difficult to regard him who was at once the Victim whose blood was offered, and the High Priest who offered his own blood, <span class="accented">at the</span> mercy-seat, as being also the Mercy-seat itself. (Thus, however, Theodoret explains: "The mercy-seat of old was itself <span class="accented">bloodless, being</span> without life, but it received the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice. But the Lord Christ and God is at once Mercy-seat, High Priest, and Lamb.") The difficulty is avoided if we take the word here in the sense of <span class="accented">propitiatory offering</span>, which in itself it will bear, a noun, such as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, being supposed to be (cf. 4 Maccabees 17:22; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16. c. 7; Dio Chrys., 'Orat.,' 11:1). Whatever its exact meaning, it evidently denotes a true fulfilment in Christ of the atonement for sin undoubtedly signified by the type; as does further <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which follows. For a distinct enunciation of the significance of bleed under the ancient ritual, as reserved for and expressing atonement, see especially <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The meaning of the whole sacrificial ritual is there expressed as being that the life of man being forfeit to Divine justice, blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. Hence, in pursuance of this idea, the frequent references in the New Testament to Hebrews physical <span class="accented">blood-shedding</span> of Christ (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"). It is not, however, implied that the material blood of Christ, shed on the cross, in itself cleanses the soul from sin, but only that it signifies to us the fulfilment in him of the type of an atoning sacrifice. As to the construction of ver. 25, it is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is to be taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning "through faith in his blood" (an unusual expression, though grammatically correct, cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>), or with <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, such as apparently to signify "in his own blood," favours the latter connection (cf. <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-25</a>, where the offering of Christ is distinguished from those of the Law in being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus the meaning will be that he was set forth (or purposed) as an <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, available for us through faith, and consisting in the offering of himself - in, the shedding of his own blood. <span class="cmt_word">For showing of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God, in order to the showing of his righteousness in the time that now is, so that he may be righteous, and justifying</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> preceding) <span class="cmt_word">him that is of faith in Jesus</span>. This translation differs materially from that of the Authorized Version, which is evidently erroneous, especially in the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by "for the remission." Our translators, in a way very unusual with them, seem to have missed the drift of the passage, and so been led to give the above untenable rendering in order to suit their view of it. It is to be observed that two purposes of the <span class="accented">setting forth</span> (or <span class="accented">purposing</span>) of Christ Jesus as <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> here declared, both denoted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is repeated, being governed in the first clause of the sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and in the second by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. Some say that the preposition is changed with no intended difference of meaning. But it is not St. Paul's way to use his prepositions carelessly. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause may be taken to denote the immediate purpose of the propitiation, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the second to have its proper significance of <span class="accented">aim</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, denoting a further intention and result, consequent on the first. The first purpose, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, was the vindication of God's righteousness with regard to the ages past, in that he had so long <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or left unvisited, the sins of mankind. The propitiation of Christ. at length <span class="accented">set forth</span> (or, as may be expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, all along <span class="accented">purposed</span>), showed that he had not been indifferent to these sins, though <span class="accented">in his forbearance</span> he had passed them over. Cf. <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; also <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where the death of Christ, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is said to have been "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant," the meaning and efficacy of the "death" being thus regarded, in the first place, as retrospective (cf. also <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). But then there was a further grand purpose, expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the second clause that of providing a way of present justification for believers now, without derogation of the Divine righteousness. Such appears to be the meaning of this passage. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being justified<p>The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned.<p>Freely (&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Gratuitously.

The distinction must be carefully maintained between this word and &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; ransom. The Vulgate, by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its result. Christ's death is nowhere styled &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; redemption. His death is the &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; ransom, figuratively, not literally, in the sense of a compensation; the medium of the redemption, answering to the fact that Christ gave Himself for us. </body></html>
