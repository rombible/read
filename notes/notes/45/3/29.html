For though they have not the doctrines of revelation, as the objects of their faith, they may believe the doctrines of natural religion, (<a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm" title="By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.">Hebrews 11:5</a>,) and live agreeably to them: in which case their faith will be counted to them for righteousness, equally as the faith of those who enjoy revelation.” The same learned writer supposes, that in the expression, <span class="ital">seeing there is one God, </span>the apostle alludes to <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>, where the prophet foretels the progress of the gospel, under the image of <span class="ital">living waters going out from Jerusalem, </span>and then adds, <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

In other words, we establish the authority, the purity, and the end of it; by defending that which the law attests, by pointing out Christ the end of it, and by showing how the moral part of it may be fulfilled in its purity. For through the influence of a <span class="ital">faith that worketh by love, </span>being enabled to love God, his children, and all mankind in sincerity and truth, we are brought to <span class="ital">serve him without </span>slavish <span class="ital">fear, </span>in <span class="ital">holiness and righteousness before him, </span>and to <span class="ital">walk in his ordinances and </span>moral <span class="ital">commandments blameless. </span>So that the <span class="ital">righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, while we walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit; </span>love to God and man, productive of such fruits, being accounted by God the fulfilling of the law, <a href="/context/romans/13-8.htm" title="Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law....">Romans 13:8-10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a>; <a href="/james/2-8.htm" title="If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:">James 2:8</a>.

Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is he the God ... - The Jews supposed that he was the God of their nation only, that they only were to be admitted to his favor.

This is assumed as an axiom by the Apostle. <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span> is the best attested reading, but the argument seems to require that it should “approximate to the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐπείπερ</span>” (Simcox, <span class="ital">Language of the N.T.</span>, p. 171), which is a variant: “if, as is the fact”.

Lightfoot insists on drawing a distinction between <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως</span> and <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως</span> in this passage. “The difference,” he says, “will perhaps best be seen by substituting their opposites, <span class="greekheb">οὐ δικαιώσει περιτομὴν ἐκ νόμου</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἀκροβυστίαν διὰ τοῦ νόμου</span>: when, in the case of the Jews, the falsity of their starting-point, in the case of the Gentiles, the needlessness of a new instrumentality, would be insisted on.” (<span class="ital">Notes on Epistles of St. Paul</span>, p. 274.)
