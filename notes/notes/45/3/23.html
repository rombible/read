We may mass these under four heads:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Paul’s view of the purpose of the law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>He has been quoting a mosaic of Old Testament passages from the Psalms and Isaiah. He regards these as part of ‘the law,’ which term, therefore, in his view, here includes the whole previous revelation, considered as making known God’s will as to man’s conduct. Every word of God, whether promise, or doctrine, or specific command, has in it some element bearing on conduct. God reveals nothing only in order that we may know, but all that, knowing, we may do and be what is pleasing in His sight. All His words are law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But Paul sets forth another view of its purpose here; namely, to drive home to men’s consciences the conviction of sin. That is not the only purpose, for God reveals duty primarily in order that men may do it, and His law is meant to be obeyed. But, failing obedience, this second purpose comes into action, and His law is a swift witness against sin. The more clearly we know our duty, the more poignant will be our consciousness of failure. The light which shines to show the path of right, shines to show our deviations from it. And that conviction of sin, which it was the very purpose of all the previous Revelation to produce, is a merciful gift; for, as the Apostle implies, it is the prerequisite to the faith which saves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As a matter of fact, there was a far profounder and more inward conviction of sin among the Jews than in any heathen nation. Contrast the wailings of many a psalm with the tone in Greek or Roman literature. No doubt there is a law written on men’s hearts which evokes a lower measure of the same consciousness of sin. There are prayers among the Assyrian and Babylonian tablets which might almost stand beside the Fifty-first Psalm; but, on the whole, the deep sense of sin was the product of the revealed law. The best use of our consciousness of what we ought to be, is when it rouses conscience to feel the discordance with it of what we are, and so drives us to Christ. Law, whether in the Old Testament, or as written in our hearts by their very make, is the slave whose task is to bring us to Christ, who will give us power to keep God’s commandments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Another purpose of the law is stated in <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>, as being to bear witness, in conjunction with the prophets, to a future more perfect revelation of God’s righteousness. Much of the law was symbolic and prophetic. The ideal it set forth could not always remain unfulfilled. The whole attitude of that system was one of forward-looking expectancy. There is much danger lest, in modern investigations as to the authorship, date, and genesis of the Old Testament revelation, its central characteristic should be lost sight of; namely, its pointing onwards to a more perfect revelation which should supersede it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Paul’s view of universal sinfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>He states that twice in this passage {<a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a> - <a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>}, and it underlies his view of the purpose of law. In <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a> he asserts that ‘by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,’ and in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> he advances from that negative statement to the positive assertion that all have sinned. The impossibility of justification by the works of the law may be shown from two considerations: one, that, as a matter of fact, no flesh has ever done them all with absolute completeness and purity; and, second, that, even if they had ever been so done, they would not have availed to secure acquittal at a tribunal where motive counts for more than deed. The former is the main point with Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> the same fact of universal experience is contemplated as both positive sin and negative falling short of the ‘glory’ {which here seems to mean, as in <a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>, <a href="/john/12-43.htm" title="For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.">John 12:43</a>, approbation from God}. ‘There is no distinction,’ but all varieties of condition, character, attainment, are alike in this, that the fatal taint is upon them all. ‘We have, all of us, one human heart.’ We are alike in physical necessities, in primal instincts, and, most tragically of all, in the common experience of sinfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul does not mean to bring all varieties of character down to one dead level, but he does mean to assert that none is free from the taint. A man need only be honest in self-examination to endorse the statement, so far as he himself is concerned. The Gospel would be better understood if the fact of universal sinfulness were more deeply felt. Its superiority to all schemes for making everybody happy by rearrangements of property, or increase of culture, would be seen through; and the only cure for human misery would be discerned to be what cures universal sinfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. So we have next Paul’s view of the remedy for man’s sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>That is stated in general terms in <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a> - <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>. Into a world of sinful men comes streaming the light of a ‘righteousness of God.’ That expression is here used to mean a moral state of conformity with God’s will, imparted by God. The great, joyful message, which Paul felt himself sent to proclaim, is that the true way to reach the state of conformity which law requires, and which the unsophisticated, universal conscience acknowledges not to have been reached, is the way of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The message is so familiar to us that we may easily fail to realise its essential greatness and wonderfulness when first proclaimed. That God should give righteousness, that it should be ‘of God,’ not only as coming from Him, but as, in some real way, being kindred with His own perfection; that it should be brought to men by Jesus Christ, as ancient legends told that a beneficent Titan brought from heaven, in a hollow cane, the gift of fire; and that it should become ours by the simple process of trusting in Jesus Christ, are truths which custom has largely robbed of their wonderfulness. Let us meditate more on them till they regain, by our own experience of their power, some of the celestial light which belongs to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Observe that in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a> the universality of the redemption which is in Christ is deduced from the universality of sin. The remedy must reach as far as the disease. If there is no difference in regard to sin, there can be none in regard to the sweep of redemption. The doleful universality of the covering spread over all nations, has corresponding to it the blessed universality of the light which is sent forth to flood them all. Sin’s empire cannot stretch farther than Christ’s kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. Paul’s view of what makes the Gospel the remedy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>In <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a> - <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a> it was stated generally that Christ was the channel, and faith the condition, of righteousness. The personal object of faith was declared, but not the special thing in Christ which was to be trusted in. That is fully set forth in <a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>. We cannot attempt to discuss the great words in these verses, each of which would want a volume. But we may note that ‘justified’ here means to be accounted or declared righteous, as a judicial act; and that justification is traced in its ultimate source to God’s ‘grace,’-His own loving disposition-which bends to unworthy and lowly creatures, and is regarded as having for the medium of its bestowal the ‘redemption’ that is in Christ Jesus. That is the channel through which grace comes from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Redemption’ implies captivity, liberation, and a price paid. The metaphor of slaves set free by ransom is exchanged in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a> for a sacrificial reference. A propitiatory sacrifice averts punishment from the offerer. The death of the victim procures the life of the worshipper. So, a propitiatory or atoning sacrifice is offered by Christ’s blood, or death. That sacrifice is the ransom-price through which our captivity is ended, and our liberty assured. As His redemption is the channel ‘through’ which God’s grace comes to men, so faith is the condition ‘through’ which {<a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>} we make that grace ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, then, that Paul does not merely point to Jesus Christ as Saviour, but to His death as the saving power. We are to have faith in Jesus Christ {<a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>}. But that is not a complete statement. It must be faith in His propitiation, if it is to bring us into living contact with His redemption. A gospel which says much of Christ, but little of His Cross, or which dilates on the beauty of His life, but stammers when it begins to speak of the sacrifice in His death, is not Paul’s Gospel, and it will have little power to deal with the universal sickness of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The last verses of the passage set forth another purpose attained by Christ’s sacrifice; namely, the vindication of God’s righteousness in forbearing to inflict punishment on sins committed before the advent of Jesus. That Cross rayed out its power in all directions-to the heights of the heavens; to the depths of Hades {<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>}; to the ages that were to come, and to those that were past. The suspension of punishment through all generations, from the beginning till that day when the Cross was reared on Calvary, was due to that Cross having been present to the divine mind from the beginning. ‘The judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted,’ or left unpunished. There would be a blot on God’s government, not because it was so severe, but because it was so forbearing, unless His justice was vindicated, and the fatal consequences of sin shown in the sacrifice of Christ. God could not have shown Himself just, in view either of age-long forbearance, or of now justifying the sinner, unless the Cross had shown that He was not immorally indulgent toward sin.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all have sinned - This was the point which he had fully established in the discussion in these chapters.<p>Have come short - Greek, "Are deficient in regard to;" are lacking, etc. Here it means, that they had failed to obtain, or were destitute of.<p>The glory of God - The praise or approbation of God.

Köllner’s objection to this view, which first offers itself, of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> as the genitive auctoris, which is also held by Piscator, Hammond, Grotius, Fritzsche, Reiche, de Wette, Tholuck, and others, following Chrysostom (comp Philippi), that it is not the fault of men if they should not have an honour, <span class="ital">which proceeds from God</span>, is of no weight; since it certainly is the fault of men, if they render it impossible for a holy God to give them the honour which proceeds from Him. Moreover, Köllner’s own explanation: honour <span class="ital">before</span> God (quite so also Calvin; and comp Philippi), which is said according to the analogy of human relations, in point of fact quite coincides with the above view, since in fact honour <span class="ital">before</span> God, or <span class="ital">with</span> God (Winzer), is nothing else than the honour that accrues to us from God’s judgment. Comp Calvin: “ita nos ab humani theatri plausu ad tribunal coeleste vocat.” Accordingly, the genitive is here all the less to be interpreted <span class="ital">coram</span>, since in no other passage (and especially not in <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, see on. <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>) is there any necessity for this interpretation. This last consideration may also be urged against the interpretation of others: <span class="ital">gloriatio coram Deo;</span> “non habent, unde coram Deo glorientur,” Estius. So Erasmus, Luther, Toletus, Wolf, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Reithmayr, and others. It is decisive against this view that in all passages where Paul wished to express <span class="ital">gloriatio</span>, he knew how to employ the proper word, <span class="greekheb">καύχησις</span> (<a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-24.htm" title="Why show you to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.">2 Corinthians 8:24</a> <span class="ital">al</span>[828]). Others, again, following Oecumenius (Chrysostom and Theophylact express themselves too indefinitely, and Theodoret is altogether silent on the matter), explain the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> to mean the <span class="ital">glory of eternal life</span>, in so far as God <span class="ital">either</span> has destined it for man (Glöckler), <span class="ital">or</span> confers it upon him (Böhme, comp Morison); <span class="ital">or</span> in so far as it consists in partaking the glory of God (Beza, comp Bengel and Baumgarten-Crusius). Mehring allows a choice between the two last definitions of the sense. But the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΎΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> proves that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> cannot in reality be anything essentially different from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, and cannot be merely future. Utterly erroneous, finally, is the view of Chemnitz, Flacius, Sebastian Schmid, Calovius,[831] Hasaeus, Alting, Carpzov, Ernesti, recently revived by Rückert, Olshausen, and Mangold, that the <span class="greekheb">δόξα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is <span class="ital">the image of God;</span> “<span class="ital">a godlike</span> <span class="greekheb">δοξα</span>,” as Rückert puts it, and thus gets rid of the objection that <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is not synonymous with <span class="greekheb">εἰκών</span>. But how arbitrarily is the relation of the genitive thus defined, altogether without the precedent of a similar usage (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> is not a case in point)! That the <span class="ital">idea</span> of the <span class="ital">image</span> of God is not suggested by anything in the <span class="ital">connection</span> is self-evident, since, as the subsequent <span class="greekheb">δικαιούμενοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[832] abundantly shows, it is the idea of the want of <span class="ital">righteousness</span> that is under discussion. Hofmann and Ewald have explained it in the same way as Rückert, though they take the genitive more accurately (a <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> such as God Himself possesses). The latter[833] understands “the glory of God which man indeed has by creation, <a href="/psalms/8-8.htm" title="The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.">Psalm 8:8</a>, but which by sin he may lose for time and eternity, and has now lost.” Compare Hofmann: “Whatsoever is of God has a share, after the manner of a creature, in the glory of God. If this therefore be not found in man, the reason is that he has forfeited the relation to God in which he was created.” But even apart from the fact that such a participation in the glory of God had been lost already through the fall (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>), and not for the first time through the individual <span class="greekheb">ἥμαρτον</span> here meant, it is decisive against this exposition that the participation in the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ</span></span></span> nowhere appears as an original blessing that has fallen into abeyance, but always as something to, be conferred only at the Parousia (<a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>) as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΔΟΞΑΣΘῆΝΑΙ</span></span></span> with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a> f.; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>); as the glorious <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛΗΡΟΝΟΜΊΑ</span></span></span> of God (comp also <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1 Peter 5:4</a>); and consequently as the <span class="ital">new</span> blessing of the <span class="ital">future</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>).

To emphasise the middle, and render “they come short, and <span class="ital">feel</span> that they do so,” though suggested by the comparison of <a href="/matthew/19-20.htm" title="The young man said to him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?">Matthew 19:20</a> with <a href="/luke/15-14.htm" title="And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.">Luke 15:14</a> (Gifford), is not borne out by the use of the N.T. as a whole. The most one could say is that <span class="ital">sibi</span> is latent in the middle: to their loss (not necessarily to their sensible or conscious loss) they come short. The present tense implies that but for sin men might be in enjoyment of “<span class="greekheb">ἡ δόξα τοῦ θεοῦ</span>”. Clearly this cannot be the same as the future heavenly glory of God spoken of in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a> : as in <a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>; <a href="/john/12-43.htm" title="For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.">John 12:43</a>, it must be the approbation or praise of God. This sense of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is easily derived from that of “reputation,” resting on the praise or approval of others.

Here the context suggests that modification of its root-meaning given in E. V.: “to suffer from defect,” “to fail to attain.”—“<span class="ital">The glory of God</span>” must here be His moral glory, His holiness and its requirements. In many passages the Word “glory” is used with evident reference to the Divine moral attributes—mercy, faithfulness, love—as well as to Divine power.

It comes immediately after the quotation from <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc., followed by "These things said Esaias, when he saw <span class="accented">his glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and spoke of him." Hence the meaning of <a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a> may probably be that the persons spoken of loved <span class="accented">mundane</span> glory (cf. <a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>) rather than the <span class="accented">Divine</span> glory, seen in the vision of faith, manifested to the world in Christ (cf. <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory," etc.), and "loved" by those who have not the eyes blinded and the heart hardened. So, even in the previous passage of St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/5-41.htm">John 5:41, 44</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> may denote man's participation in the Divine glory, rather than praise or honour, while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may mean the mundane glory conferred by men on each other. These considerations commend, in the passage before us, the interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Significatur ipsius Dei viventis gloria, <span class="accented">vitam</span> tribuens (cf. <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>); ad quam homini, si non peccasset, patuit aditus: sod peccator ab illo fine sue excidit, neque jam eum assequitur, neque gloriam illam, quae in illo effulsisset, ullo mode tolerare potest: <a href="/hebrews/12-20.htm">Hebrews 12:20</a>, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; quo fit ut morti sit obnoxius: nam gloria et immortalitas suut synonyma, et sic mors et corruptio. <span class="accented">Absunt a gloria Dei, i.e.</span> a summo fine homiuis aberrarunt. At justificati recuporant spom illius glorise. Vid. omnino c. 5:2, 11, 17; 8:30, etc." (Bengel). Further, the sense which the same expression seems evidently to bear in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a> of this Epistle is of importance for our determination of its meaning here. We are not justified in understanding, with some interpreters, any specific reference to the "image of God" (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in which man was created, and which has been lost by the Fall, there being nothing to suggest it, or, with others, <span class="accented">exclusively</span> to the future glory, since the present <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems to denote a present deficiency. The general conception appears sufficiently plain in Bengel's exposition above given, according to which "the glory of God" means the glory of the Divine righteousness ("sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" Bengel on <a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), which man, through sin, falls short of. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Have sinned (&#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Aorist tense: sinned, looking back to a thing definitely past - the historic occurrence of sin.<p>And come short (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., fall short: The present tense. The A.V. leaves it uncertain whether the present or the perfect have come is intended. They sinned, and therefore they are lacking. See on <a href="/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14</a>. The word is not merely equivalent to they are wanting in, but implies want under the aspect of shortcoming.<p>The glory of God (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Interpretations vary greatly.

Hence the idea is prominent in the redemptive revelation (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>). It expresses the form in which God reveals Himself in the economy of salvation (<a href="/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12</a>). It is the means by which the redemptive work is carried on; for instance, in calling, <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>; in raising up Christ and believers with Him to newness of life, <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; in imparting strength to believers, <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>; as the goal of Christian hope, <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>, <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. It appears prominently in the work of Christ - the outraying of the Father's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), especially in John. See <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>, etc.<p>The sense of the phrase here is: they are coming short of the honor or approbation which God bestows. The point under discussion is the want of righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves before God by the righteousness which is of the law. They come short of the approbation which is extended only to those who are justified by faith. </body></html>
