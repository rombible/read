The word "Law" has, in the Scriptures, a great variety of significations. Its strict and proper meaning is, a rule of conduct prescribed by superior authority. The course of reasoning in these chapters shows the sense in which the apostle uses it here. He intends evidently to apply it to those rules or laws by which the Jews and Gentiles pretended to frame their lives; and to affirm that people could be justified by no conformity to those laws. He had shown <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a> that "the pagan, the entire Gentile world," had violated the laws of nature; the rules of virtue made known to them by reason, tradition, and conscience. He had shown the same <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2-3</a> in respect to the Jews. They had equally failed in rendering obedience to their Law. In both these cases the reference was, not to "ceremonial" or ritual laws, but to the moral law; whether that law was made known by reason or by revelation. The apostle had not been discussing the question whether they had yielded obedience to their ceremonial law, but whether they had been found holy, that is, whether they had obeyed the moral law. The conclusion was, that in all this they had failed, and that therefore they could not be justified by that Law. That the apostle did not intend to speak of external works only is apparent; for he all along charges them with a lack of conformity of the heart no less than with a lack of conformity of the life; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29-31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>. The conclusion is therefore a general one, that by no law, made known either by reason, conscience, tradition, or revelation, could man be justified; that there was no form of obedience which could be rendered, that would justify people in the sight of a holy God.<p>There shall no flesh - No man; no human being, either among the Jews or the Gentiles. It is a strong expression, denoting the absolute universality of his conclusion; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>.<p>Be justified - Be regarded and treated as righteous. None shall be esteemed as having kept the Law, and as being entitled to the rewards of obedience; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>.<p>In his sight - Before him. God sits as a Judge to determine the characters of people, and he shall not adjudge any to have kept the Law.<p>For by the law - That is, by all law. The connection shows that this is the sense. Law is a rule of action. The effect of applying a rule to our conduct is to show us what sin is. The meaning of the apostle clearly is, that the application of a law to try our conduct, instead of being a ground of justification, will be merely to show us our own sinfulness and departures from duty. A man may esteem himself to be very right and correct, until he compares himself with a rule, or law; so whether the Gentiles compared their conduct with their laws of reason and conscience, or the Jew his with his written law, the effect would be to show them how far they had departed. The more closely and faithfully it should be applied, the more they would see it. So far from being justified by it, they would be more and more condemned; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-10</a>. The same is the case now. This is the way in which a sinner is converted; and the more closely and faithfully the Law is preached, the more will it condemn him, and show him that he needs some other plan of salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

Hence it most clearly appears, that there can be no justification before God by the law, since it stops the mouths of men, and pronounces them guilty: by "the deeds of the law" are meant, works done in obedience to it, as performed by sinful men, which are very imperfect; not as performed by Adam in innocence or by Christ in our nature whose works were perfect; but as performed by sinful men and of themselves, and not as performed in and by Christ for them who is the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness to all believers: now by such works as these whether wrought before or after conversion, with or without the strength and grace of Christ, <p>there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: that is, no one person: "flesh" designs men, and men as corrupt and carnal, in opposition to God, who is a Spirit pure and holy; and may have respect to the vain opinion of Jews and Gentiles, who were vainly puffed up in their fleshly mind; the one on account of their wisdom and learning, the other on account of their righteousness; and includes all the individuals of human nature:, the word "justified", does not signify being made righteous by the infusion of righteousness, for the infusion of a righteousness, or holiness, is sanctification, which is a work of the Spirit of God, is internal, and imperfect, and so not justifying; but it is a forensic word, or legal term, and stands opposed to a being condemned; and signifies to be acquitted, discharged, and made righteous in a legal sense, which can never be done by an imperfect obedience to the law: men may be justified hereby in their own sight, and in the sight of others, but not in "his sight"; in the sight of God, who is omniscient, and sees not as man seeth; who is pure, holy, and righteous, and whose judgment is according to truth: this is said in direct contradiction to the Jews (z), who say, <p>"a man is not justified for ever, but by the words of the law:'' <p>but in his sight none can be justified, but by the perfect obedience and righteousness of Christ. The reason for it is, <p>for by the law is the knowledge of sin; it discovers to a man, by the light of the Spirit of God, and as under his influence, and attended with his power, the sins both of his heart and life; and so he is convinced by it as a transgressor and finds himself guilty, and liable to condemnation and death; wherefore he can never hope for and expect justification by it. The Jews ascribe such an use as this to the law, which they suppose it performs in a very gentle manner; <p>"he that rises in the night (say they (a)), and studies in the law,    , "the law makes known to him his sin", but not in a way of judgment, but as a mother makes known to her son in tender language:'' <p>but this is generally done in a rougher way, for the law works wrath. <p>(z) Zohar in Lev. fol. 33. 3.((a) Zohar in Lev. fol. 10. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore by the <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> deeds of the law there shall no <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> flesh be <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> justified in his <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> sight: for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.</span><p>(o) By those deeds by which the law can be done by us.<p>(p) Flesh is here taken for man, as in many other places, and furthermore has greater force here: for it is given to show the contrast between God and man: as if one would say, Man, who is nothing else but a piece of flesh defiled with sin, and God, who is most pure and most perfect in himself.<p>(q) Absolved before the judgment seat of God.<p>(r) Paul has in mind a contrasting of the righteousness of before men, be they ever so just, against the justice which can stand before God: now there is no righteousness that can stand before God, except the righteousness of Christ alone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διότι</span>] <span class="ital">propterea quod</span>, i. 19, not <span class="ital">propterea</span> (Beza, Rosenmüller, Morus, Tholuck), is to be divided from the preceding only by a comma, and supplies the objective reason of that <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[796] of the law: <span class="ital">because the relation of righteousness will accrue to no flesh from works of the law</span>.

But neither may <span class="ital">the</span> thought be imported into the passage with reference to the Gentiles: “if they should be placed under the law and should have <span class="greekheb">ἔργα νόμου</span>” (Rückert, comp Philippi and Mehring), since, according to the context, it is only with reference to the <span class="ital">Jews</span> (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>) that the question is dealt with as to no flesh being righteous—a general relation which, as regards the Gentiles, is perfectly self-evident, seeing that the latter are <span class="greekheb">ἄνομοι</span>, and have no <span class="greekheb">ἔργα νόμου</span> in the proper sense whatever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Respecting <span class="greekheb">ἔργα νόμου</span>,[800] <span class="ital">works in harmony with the law</span> of Moses, the <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> being the prominent conception, works which are fulfilments of its precepts, comp on <a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>.

The rendering “therefore” is perhaps due to the difficulty which the translators had in putting an intelligible meaning into “because”. The sense seems to be: Every mouth must be stopped, and all the world shown to be liable to God’s judgment, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him. This last proposition—that no flesh shall be justified in this way—is virtually an axiom with the Apostle: it is a first principle in all his spiritual thinking, and hence everything must be true which can be deduced from it, and everything must take place which is required to support it. <span class="ital">Because</span> this is the fundamental certainty of the case, every mouth <span class="ital">must</span> be stopped, and the strong words quoted from the law stand where they do to secure this end. The explanation of this axiom is to be found in its principal terms—flesh and law. Flesh primarily denotes human nature in its frailty: to attain to the righteousness of God is a task which no flesh has strength to accomplish. But flesh in Paul has a moral rather than a natural meaning; it is not its weakness in this case, but its strength, which puts Justification out of the question; to justify is the very thing which the law cannot do, and it cannot do it because it is weak owing to the flesh (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>). But the explanation of the axiom lies not only in “flesh,” but in “law”. “By the law comes the full knowledge of sin.” (<span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span>, a favourite Pauline word: fifteen times used in his epistles.) This is its proper, and indeed its exclusive function. There is no law given with power to give life, and therefore there are no works of law by which men can be justified. The law has served its purpose when it has made men feel to the full how sinful they are; it brings them down to this point, but it is not for it to lift them up. The best exposition of the passage is given by the Apostle himself in <a href="/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a> f., where the same quotation is made from <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm" title="And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.">Psalm 143:2</a>, and proof given again that it applies to Jew and Gentile alike. In <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων νόμου</span>, <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span>, of course, is primarily the Mosaic law. As Lipsius remarks, no distinction is drawn by the Apostle between the ritual and the moral elements of it, though the former are in the foreground in the epistle to the Galatians, and the latter in that to the Romans. But the truth would hold of every legal dispensation, and it is perhaps to express this generality, rather than because <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> is a technical term, that the article is omitted. Under no system of statutes, the Mosaic or any other, will flesh ever succeed in finding acceptance with God.

But elsewhere, according as the subject under discussion demands, it is restricted to some particular part, and especially to deliverance from sin, so far as guilt is regarded in it: and Paul always uses it so, when, according to his design, he is treating of God justifying the sinner by faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] See Appendix.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Works of the law<p>Not the Mosaic law in its ritual or ceremonial aspect; but the law in a deeper and more general sense, as written both in the decalogue and in the hearts of the Gentiles, and embracing the moral deeds of both Gentiles and Jews. The Mosaic law may indeed be regarded as the primary reference, but as representing a universal legislation and including all the rest. The moral revelation, which is the authoritative instruction of God, may be viewed either indefinitely and generally as the revelation of God to men; or authoritatively, as to the duty incumbent on man as man; or with reference to the instruction as to the duty incumbent on men as sinful men under a dispensation of mercy; or as instruction as to the duty of Jews as Jews. <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> relates to the instruction regarding the duty incumbent on men as men.

Classical usage. The primitive meaning is to make right. This may take place absolutely or relatively. The person or thing may be made right in itself, or with reference to circumstances or to the minds of those who have to do with them. Applied to things or acts, as distinguished from persons, it signifies to make right in one's judgment. Thus Thucydides, ii. 6, 7. "The Athenians judged it right to retaliate on the Lacedaemonians." Herodotus, i., 89, Croesus says to Cyrus: "I think it right to shew thee whatever I may see to thy advantage."<p>A different shade of meaning is to judge to be the case. So Thucydides, iv., 122: "The truth concerning the revolt was rather as the Athenians, judged the case to be." Again, it occurs simply in the sense to judge. Thucydides, v., 26: "If anyone agree that the interval of the truce should be excluded, he will not judge correctly "In both these latter cases the etymological idea of right is merged, and the judicial element predominates.<p>In ecclesiastical usage, to judge to be right or to decide upon in ecclesiastical councils.<p>Applied to persons, the meaning is predominantly judicial, though Aristotle ("Nichomachaean Ethics," v., 9) uses it in the sense of to treat one rightly. There is no reliable instance of the sense to make right intrinsically; but it means to make one right in some extrinsic or relative manner. Thus Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 390-393: Paris, subjected to the judgment of men, tested (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;) is compared to bad brass which turns black when subjected to friction. Thus tested or judged he stands in right relation to men's judgments. He is shown in the true baseness of his character.<p>Thus the verb acquires the meaning of condemn; adjudge to be bad. Thucydides, iii., 40: Cleon says to the Athenians, "If you do not deal with the Mitylenaeans as I advise, you will condemn yourselves." From this readily arises the sense of punish; since the punishment of a guilty man is a setting him in right relation to the political or moral system which his conduct has infringed. Thus Herodotus, i., 100: "Deioces the Mede, if he heard of any act of oppression, sent for the guilty party and punished him according to his offense." Compare Plato, "Laws," ii., 934. Plato uses &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; to denote places of punishment or houses of correction ("Phaedrus," 249). According to Cicero, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9; was used by the Sicilians of capital punishment: "&#x395;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, that is, as the Sicilians say, they were visited with punishment and executed" ("Against Verres," v., 57).<p>To sum up the classical usage, the word has two main references: 1, to persons; 2, to things or acts. In both the judicial element is dominant. The primary sense, to make right, takes on the conventional meanings to judge a thing to be right, to judge, to right a person, to treat rightly, to condemn, punish, put to death.<p>2. New Testament usage. This is not identical with the classical usage. In the New Testament the word is used of persons only. In <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/7-35.htm">Luke 7:35</a>, of a quality, Wisdom, but the quality is personified. It occurs thirty-nine times in the New Testament; twenty-seven in Paul; eight in the Synoptists and Acts; three in James; one in the Revelation.<p>A study of the Pauline passages shows that it is used by Paul according to the sense which attaches to the adjective &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, representing a state of the subject relatively to God. The verb therefore indicates the act or process by which a man is brought into a right state as related to God. In the A.V. confusion is likely to arise from the variations in translation, righteousness, just, justifier, justify.
