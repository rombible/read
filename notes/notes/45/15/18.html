The apostle would not speak of what Christ had not wrought by him, but by his disciples, for making the Gentiles obedient; though he might have claimed some praise also from their success. But he would speak only of what Christ had wrought by him personally; namely, that he had preached the gospel with the greatest success, in many of the Gentile countries. <span class="ital">Through mighty signs and wonders </span>— It does not appear that the apostle intended by these different names to express different things, as some have supposed, namely, that the <span class="greekheb">σημεια</span>, <span class="ital">signs, </span>were the miracles intended to prove the truth of the doctrine asserted, or message brought by the miracle-worker; and that <span class="greekheb">τερατα</span>, <span class="ital">wonders, </span>were such miracles as were intended to astonish, and terrify, and draw the attention of beholders; of which sort was the punishment of Ananias and Sapphira with death, and of Elymas with blindness: he doubtless meant miracles in general, by both expressions. In the gospels, the miracles of Christ are commonly called <span class="greekheb">δυναμεις</span>, <span class="ital">powers, </span>or mighty works, to express the great power exerted in the performance of them. <span class="ital">By the power of the Spirit of God </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Enlightening men’s minds, and changing their hearts, and thereby rendering the miracles wrought, and the word preached, effectual to their conviction and conversion. <span class="ital">So that I have fully preached the gospel of Christ </span>— Have made a full declaration thereof, not shunning to declare <span class="ital">the whole counsel of God; </span>not keeping back any thing that I had reason to believe would be profitable to my hearers: <span class="ital">from Jerusalem, round about unto Illyricum </span>— This phraseology implies, that he had propagated the gospel, not in a direct line from Jerusalem to Illyricum, but far and wide, on every hand, through the interjacent countries. “Illyricum was a country in Europe, lying between Pannonia and the Adriatic sea. It is now called Sclavonia. In the history of the Acts, there is no mention made of Paul’s preaching the gospel in Illyricum. Nevertheless, as that country, on the south, bordered on Macedonia, where Paul often preached, he may, on some occasion, have gone from Macedonia into Illyricum. Yet this supposition is not necessary, as the apostle does not say he preached the gospel <span class="ital">in, </span>but only <span class="ital">as far as Illyricum: </span>which country, it appears, at the time he wrote this epistle, was the boundary of his preaching westward.” — Macknight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will not dare to speak - I should be restrained; I should be afraid to speak, if the thing were not as I have stated.

He suggests that the false teachers did speak of things which were not done by them at all, and much less were what Christ had done by them; and signifies that he was a conscientious man, and could speak nothing but what was truth; his conscience would not suffer him, nor could he allow himself to make mention of anything, that was not done by him, as if it was; nor of anything that was done by himself, nor of anything that was done, as if it was done by himself, but as it was wrought by Christ; nor had he any need to speak of any other things which he had wrought himself, as he could not of what he had not wrought at all; or, as he says, <p>which Christ hath not wrought by me: signifying that what he had wrought, and which he could with good conscience speak of to the honour of Christ, and the glory of his grace, were not wrought by himself, but what Christ wrought by him; he was only the instrument, Christ was the efficient cause: as a Christian, it was not he that lived, but Christ lived in him; as a minister, it was not he that spoke, but Christ spoke in him; nor was it he that laboured, but the grace of Christ that was with him; much less was it he that converted souls, but Christ did it by him: <p>to make the Gentiles obedient; the nations of the world, who had been brought up in blindness and ignorance of God, in rebellion and disobedience to him. The Gospel was sent among them, and was blessed unto them, to make them, of disobedient, obedient ones; not to men, but to God; not to magistrates and ministers, though they were taught to be so to both, but to Christ; to him as a priest, by being made willing to be saved by him, and him only, renouncing their own works, and disclaiming all other ways of salvation; and to submit to his righteousness for their justification before God, and acceptance with him; and to deal with his precious blood for pardon and cleansing; to rely on his sacrifice for the atonement of their sins, and to make use of him as the new and living way to the Father, as their one and only mediator, advocate, and intercessor; and to him as a prophet, to the faith of the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; not barely by hearing it, and notionally assenting to it, but by embracing it heartily, and professing it publicly and sincerely; and to him as a King, by owning him as such, and as theirs; and by subjecting to his ordinances, and obeying his commands in faith and fear, and from love to him: the means whereby these persons were brought to the obedience of Christ, and of faith, are <p>by word and deed; or "deeds", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read: by the former is meant, the word of the Gospel and the preaching of it, being sent unto them, and coming with power, and not as the word of man, but as the word of God; and by the latter, either the labour of the apostle, the pains he took, the hardships he endured, in ministering: the Gospel to them; or his agreeable life and conversation, which were a means of recommending the word, and of engaging an attention to it; or rather the miraculous works and mighty deeds which were wrought by the apostle, in confirmation of the doctrine he preached, as it seems to be explained in <a href="/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</span><p>(n) Christ was so with me in all things, and by all means, that even if I had wanted to, yet I cannot say what he has done by me to bring the Gentiles to obey the gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a>. Negative confirmation of what is asserted in <a href="/romans/15-17.htm" title="I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.">Romans 15:17</a>. The correct explanation is determined partly by the connection, to be carefully observed, of <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> with <span class="greekheb">κατειργ</span>., partly by the <span class="ital">order of the words</span>, according to which <span class="greekheb">οὐ κατειργάσατο</span> must have the emphasis, not <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> (Theodoret and others, including Calovius, Olshausen, Fritzsche, Tholuck). Hence: “<span class="ital">for I will not</span> (in any given case) <span class="ital">embolden myself to speak about any of those things</span> (to boast of anything from the sphere of that) <span class="ital">which Christ has not brought about through me, in order to make the Gentiles obedient to Him, by means of word and work</span>.” That is, affirmatively expressed: <span class="ital">for I will venture to let myself be heard only as to such things, the actual fulfilment of which has taken place by Christ through me</span>, etc.; I will therefore never pride myself on anything which belongs to the category of those things, which <span class="ital">have not been put into execution</span> by Christ through me.[23] This would be an untrue speaking of results, as if the Lord had <span class="ital">brought them about</span> through me—which nevertheless had <span class="ital">not taken place</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑπακ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶς</span>] namely, through the adoption of faith in Him; comp. <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λόγῳ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργῳ</span>] applies to <span class="greekheb">κατειργ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[23] The objection of Hofmann: “The non-actual forms no collective whole, as a constituent element of which a single thing might be conceived,” is a mere empty subtlety. Had Paul, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, boasted that Christ had wrought many conversions through him when he was in Athens, he would have spoken about something which would have been a single instance out of the category of the <span class="ital">non-actual</span>, namely, of that which Christ has <span class="ital">not wrought</span>. The view of Hofmann himself amounts to the sense, that the apostle wished to set aside all <span class="ital">his own, which was not a work of Christ performed through him, with the object of converting the Gentiles</span>. But thus, through the contrast of his <span class="ital">own</span> and the <span class="ital">work of Christ</span>, the emphasis would be transposed, resting now on <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>, as if it ran <span class="greekheb">ὧν οὐ Χριστὸς κατειργάσατο διʼ ἐμοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a> f. All other boasting he declines. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ τολμήσω τι λαλεῖν ὧν οὐ κατειργάσατο διʼ ἐμοῦ ὁ Χ</span>.: in effect this means, I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ wrought through me. This is the explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἔχω οὖν καύχησιν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>. The things which Christ did work through Paul He wrought <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑπακοὴν ἐθνῶν</span> with a view to obedience on the part of the Gentiles: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>. This combination—Christ working in Paul, to make the Gentiles obedient to the Gospel—is the vindication of Paul’s action in writing to Rome. It is not on his own impulse, but in Christ that he does it; and the Romans as Gentiles lie within the sphere in which Christ works through him. <span class="greekheb">λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ</span>: <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> refers to the preaching, <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> to all he had been enabled to do or suffer in his calling. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.">2 Corinthians 10:11</a>, <a href="/acts/7-22.htm" title="And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.">Acts 7:22</a>, <a href="/luke/24-19.htm" title="And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:">Luke 24:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν δυνάμει σημείων καὶ τεράτων</span>. <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> and <span class="greekheb">τέρας</span> are the words generally employed in the N.T. to designate what we call miracle: often, too, <span class="greekheb">δύναμεις</span> is used as synonymous (<a href="/mark/6-2.htm" title="And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are worked by his hands?">Mark 6:2</a>). All three are again applied to Paul’s miracles in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, and to similar works in the Apostolic age of the Church in <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a> : all three are also found in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, where they are ascribed to the Man of Sin, whose Parousia in this as in other respects is regarded as counterfeiting that of Christ. <span class="greekheb">τέρας</span> is always rendered “wonder” in the A.V., and, as though the word were unequal to the phenomenon, it is never used alone: in all the places in which it occurs <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> is also found. The latter emphasises the significance of the miracle; it is not merely a sight to stare at, but is suggestive of an actor and a purpose. In this passage, “the power” of signs and wonders seems to mean the power with which they impressed the beholders: more or less it is an interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἔργῳ</span>. So “the power” of the Holy Ghost means the influence with which the Holy Spirit accompanied the preaching of the Gospel: more or less it answers to <span class="greekheb">λόγῳ</span>: see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a> and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἀπόδείξει πνεύματος κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεως</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὥστε με κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “The result of Christ’s working through His Apostle is here stated as if the preceding sentence had been affirmative in form as well as sense” (Gifford). <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ</span>: this agrees with <a href="/context/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple....">Acts 9:26-29</a>, but this, of course, does not prove that it was borrowed from that passage. Even if Paul began his ministry at Damascus, he might quite well speak as he does here, for it is not its chronology, but its range, he is describing; and to his mind Jerusalem (to which, if let alone, he would have devoted himself, see <a href="/context/acts/22-18.htm" title="And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me....">Acts 22:18-22</a>) was its point of departure. <span class="greekheb">καὶ κύκλῳ</span>: most modern commentators have rendered this as if it were <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κύκλῳ</span>—from Jerusalem <span class="ital">and its vicinity</span>, by which they mean Syria (though some would include Arabia, <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>): for this use of <span class="greekheb">κύκλῳ</span> see <a href="/genesis/35-5.htm" title="And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.">Genesis 35:5</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/1-2.htm" title="And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:">Jdt 1:2</a>. But most Greek commentators render as in the A.V.—“and round about unto Illyricum”. This is the interpretation taken by Hofmann and by S. and H., and is illustrated by Xen., <span class="ital">Anab.</span>, vii., i., 14 (quoted by the latter): <span class="greekheb">πότερα διὰ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ὄρους δέοι πορεύεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">πορεύεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ κύκλῳ διὰ μέσης τῆς Θράκης</span>. <span class="greekheb">μέχρι τοῦ Ἰλλυρικοῦ</span> can (so far as <span class="greekheb">μέχρι</span> is concerned) either exclude or include Illyricum. Part of the country so called may have been traversed by Paul in the journey alluded to in <a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a> f. (<span class="greekheb">διελθὼν δὲ τὰ μέρη ἐκεῖνα</span>), but the language would be satisfied if he had come in sight of Illyricum as he would do in his westward journey through Macedonia. <span class="greekheb">πεπληρωκέναι τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: have fulfilled (fully preached) the Gospel of Christ. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>. Paul had done this in the sense in which it was required of an Apostle, whose vocation (to judge from Paul’s practice) was to lay the foundation of a church in the chief centres of population, and as soon as the new community was capable of self-propagation, to move on.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">For I will not dare</span>, &c.] This ver. may be paraphrased, “To justify this exultation, I <span class="ital">need not presumptuously intrude</span> on the work of others, putting in a false claim to credit for that work: I need only speak of what Christ has done through my personal efforts, both of preaching and miracle, in bringing Gentile converts to Him, &c.” The sentence evidently glides from the negative to the positive in the course of this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which Christ hath—wrought</span>] St Paul recognizes the Saviour as the personal and present Worker.

St Paul elsewhere distinctly claims miraculous gifts, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. In his life and teaching, as in the whole of Scripture, the natural and the supernatural are inextricably interwoven: the strongest reality of practical plans and efforts, and the most vigorous reasonings, stand linked with open references to, and cogent proofs of, the special presence around him of “the powers of the world to come.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ γὰρ τολμήσω</span>, <span class="ital">for I will not dare</span>) That is, my mind shrinks [from speaking of the things wrought by me] when unaccompanied with [except when accompanied with] Divine influence.—<span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν τι</span>, <span class="ital">to speak anything</span>) to mention anything, that I have accomplished, or rather, to preach the doctrine of the Gospel, for the expression is abbreviated, in this manner; I <span class="ital">will not dare to speak any</span> (or do any) of those things <span class="ital">which Christ</span> (would <span class="ital">not</span> speak, or) <span class="ital">do by me;</span> for, <span class="ital">by word and deed</span>, follows. The Inspiration [Theopneustia] of Paul is here marked: <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought through me unto the obedience of the Gentiles (meaning, I will not dare to speak, of any mere doings of my own, but only of those in which the power of Christ working through my ministry has been displayed) <span class="cmt_word">by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> displays of miraculous power. It is noteworthy how St. Paul alludes incidentally in his letters to such "signs and wonders" having accompanied his ministry, as to something familiar and acknowledged, so as to suggest the idea of their having been more frequent than we might gather from the Acts of the Apostles. Had the alleged "signs and wonders" been unreal, we might have expected them to be made more of in the subsequent narrative of an admirer than in contemporary letters), <span class="cmt_word">by the power of the Spirit of God</span> (al. <span class="accented">the Holy Spirit.</span> This power, if taken as distinct from that of <span class="accented">signs and wonders</span>, may denote the power of the Holy Spirit displayed in the conversion of believers, and the gifts bestowed upon them); <span class="cmt_word">so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached</span> (literally, <span class="accented">I have fulfilled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the gospel of Christ</span>. In thus designating the sphere of his ministry the apostle is denoting its local extent, rather than the course he had taken. He had, in fact, preached first at Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>), and afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a>); but he mentions Jerusalem first, as being the original home of the gospel in the East, and, indeed, the first scene of his own preaching in fellowship with the original apostles. Thence he had extended it in various quarters (for the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> - trans. "round about" - cf. <a href="/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>), and carried it into Europe, Illyricum being the western limit so far reached. It is true that there is no mention in the Acts of his having actually visited Illyria. In the journey of <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. he plainly got no further west than Betted, which is, however, not far off; and he might possibly mean here only to say that he had extended the gospel to the borders of Illyricum, but for the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and his seeming to imply afterwards (ver. 23) that he had gone as far as he could in those regions, and consequently contemplated a journey to Spain. Hence, the narrative of Acts not being an exhaustive history, it may be supposed that he had on some occasion extended his operations from Macedonia to Illyricum, as he may well have done on his visit to the latter mentioned in <a href="/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1-3</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> allows for a visit into Illyricum. </body></html>
