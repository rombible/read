(Comp. also <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>.) The two words are very similar in meaning. They denote the same acts, but they connote different aspects in which those acts may be regarded. The word “signs” tends to bring out the symbolical character of the miracle, the spiritual truth of which it was, as it were, the physical expression. In the word “wonders” stress is laid rather upon its character as a portent, a manifestation of supernatural, divine power. That St. Paul himself claimed miraculous powers is a face that cannot be doubted.<p><span class= "bld">By the power of the Spirit of God.</span>—The two clauses at the beginning of this verse correspond roughly to “by word and deed” at the end of the last. “Signs and wonders” are the manifestation of the effectual working of Christ in “deed.” The “power of the Spirit of God” is exemplified both in “deed” and in “word.”<p><span class= "bld">So that . . .</span>—It is to be noticed that the language of the Apostle becomes more and more definite and concrete, till he ends by describing the geographical extent of his own labours.<p><span class= "bld">Jerusalem.</span>—The Apostle naturally takes this as the <span class= "ital">terminus à quo,</span> partly because it was at this time the centre and head-quarters of Christianity, and also more especially because it was the extreme point eastwards and southwards of his own public ministry. (His sojourn in “Arabia,” which may include the desert of Sinai, appears to have been of a more private character.)<p><span class= "bld">And round about . . .</span>—In a sort of rough curve, embracing a large portion of Asia Minor, and finally turning towards the starting-point again in Illyricum.<p><span class= "bld">Illyricum.</span>—A Roman province, stretching along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, and forming the northern boundary of Epirus, and the north-western of Macedonia. Whether St. Paul had actually visited Illyricum does not appear from his language in this passage. Illyricum is the <span class= "ital">terminus ad quem</span> of his journeyings, but it may be inclusive, or it may be exclusive. The description would be sufficiently satisfied if he had approached the outskirts of Illyricum during his journey through Macedonia. That journey must be the one recorded in <a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>. The earlier journey of Acts 16, 17 can be traced clearly from place to place, and did not extend far enough inland, while the vague expression which we find in <a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>, “When he had gone over those parts,” affords ample room for the circuit in question. This would place it at the end of the year 57 A.D.<p><span class= "bld">Fully preached.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">fulfilled.</span> The translation of our version can perhaps hardly be improved, though, at the same time, it seems probable that what is intended is the publication of the gospel to its full geographical extent, and not the subjective sense in the Apostle of his own fulfilment of the duty of preaching the gospel laid upon him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through mighty signs and wonders - By stupendous and striking miracles; see the note at <a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a>.

Which is its true meaning cannot, perhaps, be ascertained. The interpretations "agree" in this, that he traced his success in "all" things to the aid of the Holy Spirit.<p>So that from Jerusalem - Jerusalem, as a "center" of his work; the center of all religious operations and preaching under the gospel. This was not the place where "Paul" began to preach <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>, but it was the place where the "gospel" was first preached, and the apostles began to reckon their success from that as a point; compare the note at <a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>.<p>And round about - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#837;  kai kuklo&#772;. In a circle. That is, taking Jerusalem as a center, he had fully preached round that center until you come to Illyricum.<p>Unto Illyricum - Illyricum was a province lying to the northwest of Macedonia, bounded north by a part of Italy and Germany, east by Macedonia, south by the Adriatic, west by Istria. It comprehended the modern Croatia and Dalmatia. So that taking Jerusalem as a center, Paul preached not only in Damascus and Arabia, but in Syria, in Asia Minor, in all Greece, in the Grecian Islands, and in Thessaly and Macedonia. This comprehended no small part of the then known world; "all" of which had heard the gospel by the labors of one indefatigable man There is no where in the Acts express mention of Paul's going "into" Illyricum; nor does the expression imply that he preached the gospel "within" it, but only "unto" its borders. It may have been, however, that when in Macedonia, he crossed over into that country; and this is rendered somewhat probable from the fact that "Titus" is mentioned as having gone into "Dalmatia" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, which was a part of Illyricum.<p>I have fully preached - The word used here means properly "to fill up" &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  peple&#772;ro&#772;kenai, "to complete," and here is used in the sense of "diffusing abroad," or of "filling up" all that region with the gospel; compare <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>. It means that he had faithfully diffused the knowledge of the gospel in all that immense country. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

The word dunamiv, <span class="ital">power, </span> or virtue, is twice used in this verse; it is first applied to signs and wonders, to show their efficacy; and then to the Spirit of God, to show that he was the efficient cause of that efficacy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum:</span> this showeth the pains and travail of the apostle, to bring the Gentiles to the obedience of faith. Illyricum is said to be in the utmost parts of Greece, bordering upon the sea, which is thereupon called Illyricum Mare. It is thought to be the country now called Sclavonia, and that is distant from Jerusalem about three hundred and fifty German miles, which make above a thousand English miles; yet it seems he did not travel in a direct and straight line, but round about, or in a circle, as the word imports, fetching a circuit. Some writers have given us out of the Acts a particular history of his peregrination from Damascus, where he began his ministry: he went into Arabia, and after three years returned to Damascus, and from thence to Jerusalem; from Jerusalem he went to Caesarea, and so to Tarsus; from Tarsus Barnabas brought him to Antioch, and from thence to Jerusalem, to carry relief to the Jews. From Jerusalem they returned to Antioch; from Antioch he and Barnabas went to Seleucia, then to Cyprus, and to some cities of Pamphylia, and so to another Antioch in Pisidia; from thence to Lycaonia, and then returned to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended by the church. From Antioch they were sent to Jerusalem about the question of the circumcision, and returned to Antioch with the apostles’ decree. From thence he went through Syria and Cilicia, visiting the churches. Then he went through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; then to Troas, where by a vision he was called unto Macedonia, and so came into the parts of Europe; first to Philippi in Macedonia, then to Thessalonica; from thence to Athens, and then to Corinth; from thence to Ephesus; and going to visit the churches of Galatia and Phrygia, returned to Ephesus. From Ephesus he went again to Macedonia; from thence to Troas and Miletus; and thence, by Tyrus and Caesarea, and other cities, he came to Jerusalem, where he was taken and put in bonds. Thus you have an account of the apostle’s travels, which he abridgeth here, when he says, that it was <span class="ital">from Jerusalem round about unto Illyricum.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; </span> i.e. I have filled all these countries with the gospel of Christ.

Or "in", or "through the power of signs and wonders", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions render the words. These carrying along with them evidence and conviction of the truth of what was delivered, wrought wonderfully and powerfully on the minds of the Gentiles to embrace the Gospel, and submit to the ordinances of it; though all would have been insufficient, had it not been for what follows, <p>by the power of the Spirit of God: the Alexandrian copy and one of Stephens's read, "by the power of the Holy Spirit", and so does the Vulgate Latin version; meaning, either that the mighty signs and wonders in healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, raising the dead, &amp;c. were performed not by the efficacy and working of Satan, as the signs and lying wonders of antichristian men, but by the Spirit of God, by whom Christ and all his apostles wrought the miracles they did; or that the ministration of the word in which the apostle laboured, was by the power of the Spirit of God; it was he that imparted all spiritual gifts to him, qualifying him for this service; it was he that assisted him in it, and enabled him to go through it; it was in demonstration of the Spirit and of power that he performed it; and that not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth: or else that the obedience of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ, through the preaching of the Gospel, and the wonderful works that attended it as means, were purely owing to the power of the Spirit of God, as the efficient cause; it was not by might, or power of the preacher; nor merely by the power of signs and wonders; but by the powerful and efficacious grace of the Spirit of God, who took away the stony, stubborn, and disobedient heart, and gave them an heart of flesh, a tender, flexible, and obedient one; and caused them to walk in and observe the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: <p>so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ; that which Christ, as God, is the author of; as man, was a preacher and minister of; and, as Mediator, is the subject matter of: this the apostle "preached fully" and completely, every part and branch of it, kept back nothing of it, but faithfully declared the whole; and so fulfilled it, as the word may be rendered, and his ministry; or he filled the Gospel, the net of the Gospel, which he spread in every place; or rather he diffused the knowledge of it everywhere; he filled all places with it wherever he came, even "from Jerusalem" round about unto Illyricum: not that he began to preach at Jerusalem, but at Damascus; from whence he went to Arabia, and after that to Jerusalem; but inasmuch as he was of Jerusalem, and had preached there, from whence the Gospel originally came, and this was the boundary of his ministry one way, he makes mention of it; as Illyricum was the boundary of it another way, which was on the extreme part of Macedonia: it is now called Sclavonia, and is an European nation; part of it is Dalmatia, mentioned <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. Apollonia was in it, according to Mela (z), where the apostle is said to pass through, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1</a>, it has on the south the gulf of Venice, on the north the Danube, on the west Germany, and on the east Thracia and Macedonia: according to Ptolomy (a), Illyris, or Illyricum, was bounded on the north with upper and lower Pannonia, now called Hungary and Austria; on the east with upper Mysia, now Servia; and on the south with part of Macedonia; it lies over against Italy, the Adriatic sea being between them; its length, from the river Drinus to Arsa, is reckoned about 480 miles, and its breadth, from the mountains of Croatia to the sea, is computed to be about 120: it is by some divided into Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Albania; Slavonia is the western part, Albania the eastern, and Dalmatia between them; according to others, it includes Slavonia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia; and had its name of Illyricum, from Illyrius, the son of Cadmus; or as others, from Illyrius, the son of Celta: here the Gospel was preached by the Apostle Paul, and no doubt with success; and churches were planted here, and which remained for several ages: in the "second" century there was a church in Illyricum, and Eleutherius was bishop, who is said to be a famous teacher; he was born at Rome, and his mother Anthia is reported to be converted by the Apostle Paul; in the same age lived one Quirinus, first a tribune, and then a bishop of Illyricum, who became a martyr under Trajan: in the "third" century there were churches in Illyricum, though devastations were made in it by the Goths; in the "fourth" century, frequent mention is made of the churches in Illyricum; and the bishops convened at Rome under Damascus in the times of Constantius wrote with great respect to the brethren in Illyricum; in Siscia, a city in this country, Quirinus a bishop suffered martyrdom; here a synod met against the Arians, and yet many in this country were infected with that heresy, by Valens and Ursatius; in this age Hilary, of Poictiers in France, spread the Gospel in this country; and he and Eusebius of Vercelli, in Piedmont, visited the churches, and corrected what was amiss: in the "fifth" century there was a church in Illyricum, and in Salo, a city of Dalmatia, Glycerius was bishop: in the "sixth" century there were also churches here, as appears from the letter of Symmachus to the bishops of them, and to their people; and in this age also Gregory wrote to all the bishops in Illyricum, to receive such bishops as were banished: in the "eighth" century, the bishops of Illyricum were in the Nycene synod, and Boniface gathered a church in Slavonia (b); thus far Christianity may be traced in this country: hither the apostle went, not in a direct line, but round about, and took many countries, cities, and towns in his way, as the history of his journeys and travels in the Acts of the Apostles shows, and as he here suggests. <p>(z) De orbis situ, l. 2. c. 10.

Of course, however, <span class="greekheb">κύκλῳ</span> is not included in the dependence on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΌ</span></span></span>, but stands in answer to the question Where? inasmuch as it adds to the statement <span class="ital">from, whence</span> the working took place, the notice of the <span class="ital">local sphere</span>, which had been jointly affected by that local beginning as its field of action: <span class="ital">from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round</span>, Paul has fulfilled the gospel as far as Illyria. Flacius, Calovius, Paulus, Glöckler, following Chrysostom, Theodoret, and others, refer <span class="greekheb">κύκλῳ</span> to the <span class="ital">arc</span> which Paul described in his journey from Jerusalem by way of Syria, Asia, Troas, Macedonia, and Greece to Illyria. According to this, <span class="greekheb">κύκλῳ</span> would specify the <span class="ital">direction</span> in which he, starting from Jerusalem, moved forward. So also Hofmann. This direction would be that of a <span class="ital">curve</span>. But <span class="greekheb">κύκλῳ</span> never denotes this, and is never merely the opposite of <span class="ital">straight out</span>, but always <span class="ital">circumcirca</span> (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/1-2.htm" title="And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:">Jdt 1:2</a>; <a href="/mark/3-34.htm" title="And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!">Mark 3:34</a>; <a href="/mark/6-6.htm" title="And he marveled because of their unbelief.

No reason also would be discoverable for Paul’s adding the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, and not merely writing <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΚΛῼ</span></span></span>, in order to express: from Jerusalem <span class="ital">in a circular direction as far as Illyria</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μέχρι τοῦ Ἰλλυρ</span>.] The idea that Paul, as has recently been for the most part assumed, did not get to Illyria <span class="ital">at all</span>, but only <span class="ital">to the frontier</span> of this western region during a Macedonian bye-journey, throws upon him an appearance of magnifying his deeds, for which the silence of the Acts of the Apostles, furnishing, as it does, no complete narrative, supplies no warrant. Now, since in <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a> Illyria may not, without arbitrariness, be excluded from the regions where he has already laboured, because this country would otherwise have still afforded scope for labour, we must assume that Paul had really made an intermediate journey to Illyria. From what starting-point, cannot indeed be shown; hardly so soon as <a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a>, but possibly during the journey mentioned in <a href="/context/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia....">Acts 20:1-3</a> (see Anger, <span class="ital">temp. rat</span>. p. 84), so that his short sojourn in Illyria took place <span class="ital">not long before</span> his sojourn in Achaia, where he at Corinth wrote the Epistle to the Romans. <a href="/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a> can only be employed in confirmation of this by those who assume the authenticity of the Epistle to Titus, and its composition thus early (see Wieseler, Philippi).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πεπληρωκέναι τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>.] <span class="ital">have brought to fulfilment</span> (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>) the gospel of Christ. This <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> has taken place in an <span class="ital">extensive</span> sense through the fact that the gospel is spread abroad everywhere from Jerusalem to Illyria, and has met with acceptance. Analogous is the conception: <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἠύξανε</span>, <a href="/acts/6-7.htm" title="And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="/acts/12-24.htm" title="But the word of God grew and multiplied.">Acts 12:24</a>; <a href="/acts/19-20.htm" title="So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.">Acts 19:20</a>. So long as the news of salvation has not yet reached its full and destined diffusion, it is still in the course of growth and increase; but when it has reached every quarter, so that no place any longer remains for the labour of the preacher (<a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>), it has passed from the state of growing increase into the <span class="ital">full measure of its dimensions</span>. This view of the sense is alone strictly textual (see <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>), while closely adhering to the literal signification of <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγ</span>., which denotes the message itself, not the act of proclamation (Th. Schott, Mangold); and hence excludes the many divergent interpretations, namely: (1) That of Beza, Piscator, Grotius, Bengel, de Wette, Rückert, in substance also Köllner, Tholuck, van Hengel, and permissively, Reiche, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΑΓΓ</span></span></span>. is equivalent to <span class="ital">munus praedicandi evang</span>., which it does not mean; similarly Ewald: the executed <span class="ital">commission</span> of preaching. (2) That of Luther, Flacius, Castalio, and others: “that I <span class="ital">have fulfilled everything with the gospel</span>,” which is opposed to the words as they stand, although repeated by Baur. (3) That of Theophylact, Erasmus, and others, including Reiche and Olshausen: <span class="greekheb">πληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. denotes <span class="ital">completely to proclaim</span> the gospel. But the “<span class="ital">completely</span>” would in fact have here no relevant weight at all (such as at <a href="/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>); for that Paul had not <span class="ital">incompletely</span> preached the gospel, was understood of itself. Others arbitrarily take it otherwise still, <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Calvin: “praedicationem ev. quasi <span class="ital">supplendo diffundere</span>; coeperunt enim alii priores, sed ipse longius sparsit;” Krehl: that I have <span class="ital">put</span> the gospel <span class="ital">into force and validity</span>; Philippi: that I have <span class="ital">realized</span> the gospel, have introduced it into life (the gospel appearing as <span class="ital">empty</span>, before it is taught, accepted, understood); Hofmann, with comparison of the not at all analogous expression <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν τὸν νόμον</span>: the message of salvation misses its destination, if it remain <span class="ital">unproclaimed</span>—whereby <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> would be reduced simply to the notion of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΗΡΎΣΣΕΙΝ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole of the remark, <a href="/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a> f., connected with <a href="/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24</a>, is to be explained, according to Baur, I. p. 307, simply from the intention (of the later writer) to draw here, as it were, a geographical line between two apostolic provinces, of which the one must be left to Peter. In opposition to <span class="ital">such</span> combinations, although Lucht still further elaborates them, it is sufficient simply to put into the scale the altogether Pauline character and emotional stamp of the language in <a href="/context/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ....">Romans 15:19-33</a>, in its inner truth, simplicity, and chasteness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[24] Yet he does not say “from Arabia” (Gal. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>), because it was very natural for him significantly to place the beginning at that spot where all the other apostles had begun their work and the apostolic church itself had arisen—in doing which, however, he, by adding <span class="greekheb">καὶ κύκλῳ</span>, does nothing to the prejudice of history. The less is there to be found in <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Ἱερους</span>. an inconsistency with the statements of the Epistle to the Galatians. This in opposition to Lucht, who sees also in <span class="greekheb">μέχρι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰλλυρ</span>. an <span class="ital">incorrect</span> statement, and attributes to both points <span class="ital">a special design</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">through mighty signs</span>, &c.] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">in the might of signs and wonders, in the might of the Spirit of God</span>.

But Meyer rightly says that, if so, this verse would be tainted with just that boastfulness (<span class="ital">Grossthuerei</span>) which was so earnestly renounced in <a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a>.

So here, St Paul “fulfilled” the whole possible scope of the Gospel-message, in point of geographical space, in the direction taken by his work.
