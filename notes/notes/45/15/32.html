How careful should we be, lest we forfeit our interest in the love and prayers of God's praying people! If we have experienced the Spirit's love, let us not be wanting in this office of kindness for others. Those that would prevail in prayer, must strive in prayer. Those who beg the prayers of others, must not neglect to pray for themselves. And though Christ knows our state and wants perfectly, he will know them from us. As God must be sought, for restraining the ill-will of our enemies, so also for preserving and increasing the good-will of our friends. All our joy depends upon the will of God. Let us be earnest in prayer with and for each other, that for Christ's sake, and by the love of the Holy Spirit, great blessings may come upon the souls of Christians, and the labours of ministers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That I may come to you - That I I may not be impeded in my intended journey by opposition in Judea.<p>With joy - Joy to myself in being permitted to come; and producing joy to you by my presence.<p>By the will of God - If God will; if God permit.

The end the apostle had, in desiring them to request the above things at the throne of grace for him, was, that he might come to them, which unless he was delivered from the unbelieving Jews, could not be; and therefore since they had an interest in this matter, he might hope they would be the more importunate in their supplications for him, the he might escape their hands; and seeing also, should the saints there use him in an ungrateful manner, and slight the kindness of the Gentile churches, and his service should not have the desired effect, his coming to them would be with sorrow: wherefore he puts them upon praying for success in this affair, that so when he came among them he should have no uneasiness upon his mind, or, anything of this kind to distress him, and interrupt that pleasure and delight he promised himself in their company and conversation: he adds, <p>by the will of God: resigning himself, and submitting all things to the sovereign will of God, and the wise disposals of his providence: he knew his deliverance from his enemies must be by, and the success of his services owing to, and his coming to Rome entirely according to, the will of God, and as he should think fit and proper; so he acted himself, and so he taught these believers to have their regard to, and sit down contented with the will of God in all things; to which he subjoins, <p>and may with you be refreshed; with the presence of God among them, with the Gospel in the fulness and blessing of it with which he should come and with the mutual faith and comfortable experience of him and them, which they should communicate to each other; than all which nothing is more reviving, and refreshing to the spirits of God's people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/romans/15-32.htm" title="That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed....">Romans 15:32-33</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span>] Aim of <a href="/romans/15-31.htm" title="That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;">Romans 15:31</a>, and so <span class="ital">final aim</span> of <span class="greekheb">συναγωνίσασθαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>.
