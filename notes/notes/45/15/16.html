He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The minister - &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  leitourgon. This is not the word which is commonly translated "minister" &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  diakonos. This word is properly appropriated to those who minister in public offices or the affairs of the state. In the New Testament it is applied mainly to the Levitical priesthood, who ministered and served at the altar; <a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>. It is however applied to the ministers of the New Testament, as discharging "substantially" the same offices toward the church which were discharged by the Levitical priesthood; that is, as engaged in promoting the welfare of the church, occupied in holy things, etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, "as they "ministered" to the Lord and fasted," etc. It is still used in a larger sense in <a href="/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>.<p>To the Gentiles - Compare <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>.<p>Ministering - &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  hierourgounta. Performing the function of a priest in respect to the gospel of God. The office of a "priest" was to offer sacrifice. Paul here retains the "language," though without affirming or implying that the ministers of the New Testament were literally "priests" to offer sacrifice. The word used here occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Its meaning here is to be determined from the connection. The question is, What is the "sacrifice" of which he speaks? It is the "offering up" - the sacrifice of the Gentiles. The Jewish sacrifices were abolished. The Messiah had fulfilled the design of their appointment, and they were to be done away. (See the Epistle to the Hebrews.) There was to be no further "literal" sacrifice. But now the "offerings" of the Gentiles were to be as acceptable as had been the offerings of the Jews. God made no distinction; and in speaking of these offerings, Paul used "figurative" language drawn from the Jewish rites. But assuredly he did not mean that the offerings of the Gentiles were "literal" sacrifices to expiate sins; nor did he mean that there was to be an order of men who were to be called "priests" under the New Testament. If this passage "did" prove that, it would prove that it should be confined to the "apostles," for it is of them only that he uses it. The meaning is this: "Acting in the Christian church substantially as the priests did among the Jews; that is, endeavoring to secure the acceptableness of the offerings which the Gentiles make to God."<p>That the offering up - The word here rendered "offering up" &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;  prosphora commonly means "a sacrifice" or an "expiatory" offering, and is applied to Jewish sacrifices; <a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>; <a href="/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>. It is also applied to the sacrifice which was made by our Lord Jesus Christ when he offered himself on the cross for the sins of people; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>. It does not always mean "bloody" sacrifices, but is used to denote "any" offering to God; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>. Hence, it is used in this large sense to denote the "offering" which the Gentiles who were converted to Christianity made of themselves; their "devoting" or dedicating themselves to God. The "language" is derived from the customs of the Jews; and the apostle represents himself "figuratively" as a priest presenting this offering to God.<p>Might be acceptable - Or, approved by God. This was in accordance with the prediction in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>, "They shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations," etc. This does not mean that it was by any merit of the apostle that this offering was to be rendered "acceptable"; but that he was appointed to prepare the way, so that "their" offering, as well as that of the "Jews," might come up before God.<p>Being sanctified - That is, "the offering" being sanctified, or made holy. The sacrifice was "prepared" or made fit "to be" an offering, among the Jews, by salt, oil, or frankincense, according to the nature of the sacrifice; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a>, etc. In allusion to this, the apostle says that the offering of the Gentiles was rendered "holy," or fit to be offered, by the converting and purifying influences of the Holy Spirit. They were prepared, not by salt and frankincense, but by the cleansing influences of God's Spirit. The same idea, substantially, is expressed by the apostle Peter in <a href="/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. that I should be the&#8212;rather, "a"<p>minister&#8212;The word here used is commonly employed to express the office of the priesthood, from which accordingly the figurative language of the rest of the verse is taken.<p>of Jesus Christ&#8212;"Christ Jesus," according to the true reading.<p>to the Gentiles&#8212;a further proof that the Epistle was addressed to a Gentile church.

The office of apostleship is here amplified and enlarged on, and the ends shown for which that grace was given to him, that he should be a minister; not in holy things about the temple, as the priests and Levites were; or a teacher of the law, some were fond of; but a minister of Christ, one that was made so by him, was qualified and sent forth to minister in his name to men; and who was a preacher of him; Jesus Christ, and him crucified, was the grand subject of his ministrations; he adds, <p>to the Gentiles; for to them, though not to the exclusion of the Jews, was he appointed a minister by Christ, and sent by him to them; among them he chiefly ministered, and was particularly and eminently useful to them; and this is another reason why the Romans ought to bear with a little boldness and freedom in writing to them, since he was the apostle of the Gentiles: <p>ministering the Gospel of God; not the service of the temple, nor the traditions of the elders, nor the law of Moses, nor the morality of the Heathens; but the Gospel, of which God is the author, whose grace is the subject, and whose glory is the end; and is good news from him to the chief of sinners; to the preaching of which the apostle was separated by him: <p>that the offering up of the Gentiles; not the offering the Gentiles offered up, their prayers, praises, or good works, though these are acceptable to God through Christ; but the Gentiles themselves, by the offering up of whom is meant their conversion; which was the end of the apostle's ministering the Gospel among them, and in which he was the happy instrument. The allusion is to the priests slaying and offering up sacrifices under the law. The apostle was a priest in a figurative and improper sense; the sacrifices he offered up were not slain beasts, but men, the Gentiles, cut to the heart by the sword of the Spirit, the ministry of the Gospel; whose inside being laid open to them, and they brought to a sense of their lost condition, and need of Christ, were, through the power of divine grace attending the word, made willing to offer, or give up themselves to the Lord, to be saved by him, and him only: this the apostle, as an instrument, was concerned in; and all his view was, that it <p>might be acceptable; that is, to God, as nothing is more so to him than a broken and a contrite heart, or souls brought to a sense of themselves; and to believe in Christ, and submit to his righteousness; and then both ministers and converts are unto God, a sweet savour of Christ: <p>being sanctified by the Holy Ghost; this is said in allusion to the washing of the sacrifices under the law; and intimates, that the Gentiles, though unclean by nature and practice, yet being sanctified by the Spirit of God, whose proper work it is to sanctify, become an acceptable, being an holy sacrifice to an holy God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</span><p>(m) By the offering up of the Gentiles, he means the Gentiles themselves, whom he offered to God as a sacrifice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τὸ εἶναι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Specification of the object aimed at in <span class="greekheb">τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι ὑπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λειτουργόν</span>] Comp. on <a href="/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a>.

Anab</span>. vi. 4. 9), in accordance with which <span class="greekheb">εὐπρόσδ</span>. is then <span class="ital">attributive</span> (<span class="ital">as well-pleasing</span>), and <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. is subordinated to the latter as its ground: <span class="ital">sanctified through the Holy Spirit</span>, which is received through the gospel in baptism, <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>. A contrast to the ceremonial consecration of the Levitical offerings. Comp. <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">the minister</span>] The Gr. word (not the same as that in e.g. <a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>,) is the original of our word <span class="ital">liturgy;</span> and is the same as in <a href="/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Php 2:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; &c. The word in Biblical Greek has a frequent sacerdotal reference; which is certainly present here, as the rest of the verse shews. For the word rendered “ministering” just below is lit. “<span class="ital">doing priest’s-work with;</span>” and it is followed, in the next clause, by “the <span class="ital">offering-up</span> of the Gentiles.” The whole passage is strikingly pictorial and figurative; representing the Gospel as the <span class="ital">sacerdotal rule;</span> the Apostle as the <span class="ital">sacrificing priest;</span> and the converts from heathenism as the <span class="ital">victims</span> of the sacrifice. A passage of somewhat similar imagery is <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>, where the Gr. of “service” is kindred to the Gr. of “minister” here. There (in Bp Lightfoot’s words) “the Philippians are the priests; their faith (or their good works springing from their faith) is the sacrifice; St Paul’s life-blood the accompanying libation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is clear that the Apostle here speaks of himself as a Sacrificer in a sense wholly figurative; and this passage and <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a> (where see note,) are the only examples of his application of the sacrificial idea, in even a figurative sense, to himself. Dr Hodge remarks that we here see the true nature of the priesthood which belongs to the Christian ministry: “It is by the preaching of the Gospel to bring men to <span class="ital">offer themselves</span> as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” See <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the offering up of the Gentiles</span>] i.e. the offering which consists of the Gentiles; the Gentiles, as “yielding themselves to God” to be His dedicated servants.
