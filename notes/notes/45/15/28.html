It concerns all to do that first which is most needful. We must not take it ill if our friends prefer work which is pleasing to God, before visits and compliments, which may please us. It is justly expected from all Christians, that they should promote every good work, especially that blessed work, the conversion of souls. Christian society is a heaven upon earth, an earnest of our gathering together unto Christ at the great day. Yet it is but partial, compared with our communion with Christ; for that only will satisfy the soul. The apostle was going to Jerusalem, as the messenger of charity. God loves a cheerful giver. Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof and instance of the union they have in Jesus Christ. The Gentiles received the gospel of salvation from the Jews; therefore were bound to minister to them in what was needed for the body. Concerning what he expected from them he speaks doubtfully; but concerning what he expected from God he speaks confidently. We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much from God.

Meaning when he had dispatched that business, and finished that affair which the Macedonian and Achaian churches had entreated him to engage in, and which he had undertook; namely, to take their collection, and carry it to Jerusalem, and distribute it among the poor saints there; and which he expresses by another phrase, <p>and have sealed to them this fruit. The liberality of the Gentile churches is called fruit, as it may be on many accounts; as with respect to the apostle, it was the fruit of his ministry and laborious preaching of the Gospel among them; he had been sowing the seed of the word, and planting churches in these parts; and among other fruits brought forth hereby, as the conversion of sinners, and edification of saints, the exercise of grace, and performance of good works, this of liberality to the poor saints was one: with respect to the persons, the objects of this bounty, it was the fruit of their spiritual things, which the Gentiles, by their means, had been partakers of; and would be as fruit, useful and profitable to them, to relieve their wants, supply them with necessaries, and make their lives more comfortable: and also with respect to the contributors, it was the fruit of the Spirit of God, and his grace in them; it was the fruit of faith, which works by love; and it was the fruit of their love to Christ, and to his saints; and was profitable to them in things temporal, spiritual, and eternal; promises of each being made and performed to such that sow liberally and bountifully. Now the ministration of this to the poor saints at Jerusalem, and on the behalf of the Grecian churches, the apostle calls a "sealing" it to them; and it is thought to be an allusion to the delivery of money sealed up, that it may not be lost, nor made use of for any other purpose than that for which it was designed: whether the apostle carried this collection sealed or not, it matters not; his sense is, that he should deliver it whole and safe unto them, and in such manner as to leave no suspicion that he had converted any part of it to his own use; though the word here used seems to answer to the Hebrew  which, with the Jews, frequently signifies to conclude, "finish", and make an end of anything, as well as to "seal"; the sealing up of letters being the last and finishing part of them. Innumerable instances might be given; take the following one as a proof (d): <p>"we find in the former prophets, , "that they sealed", or ended their words with words of praise, or with words of consolation Says R. Eliezer, except Jeremiah,  "who sealed", or finished with words of reproof.'' <p>So the word is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>, and then the apostle's plain meaning is, when I have made an end of this affair, have finished this business of ministering and distributing to the poor saints at Jerusalem, <p>I will come by you into Spain. The Ethiopic version reads it, "Lasitania", designing, no doubt, Lusitania, which was formerly a part of Spain, now called Portugal. Whether the apostle ever was there is not certain nor very probable, since when he came to Jerusalem he was apprehended, and after sometime sent a prisoner to Rome, where he suffered; however, it was his intention to go to Spain, and to take Rome in his way thither. <p>(d) T.

In these circumstances, an unusual thoughtful expression for the concluding act offers itself naturally. But that which Fritzsche finds in it (rendering of an account and other formalities) neither lies in the simple figurative word, nor was it doubtless intended by Paul, considering his apostolical dignity. Others take <span class="greekheb">σφραγις</span>. in the <span class="ital">proper</span> sense, either thus: “<span class="ital">when I have brought over the money to them, sealed</span>” (Erasmus, Cornelius a Lapide, Estius), which, however, the words do not express at all, and how paltrily unapostolic the thought would be! or, referring <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span> to the Greek Christians (so already Theodoret): “<span class="ital">when I have made them secure with letter and seal respecting the right delivery of their collection</span>” (Glöckler, and so already Michaelis), against which, apart from the unsuitableness of the sense, it is decisive that <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span> brooks no other reference than <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΟῖς</span></span></span>, <a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are.

This also against Reithmayr, who brings out even a <span class="ital">depositing</span> for the almsgivers <span class="ital">in God’s treasury!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] </span>The act of handing over itself, namely, was the <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span> of the collection for the recipients. <span class="ital">Before</span> the delivery the moneys were indeed <span class="ital">destined</span> for them, but not yet <span class="ital">de facto assured</span> to them as property on the part of the apostle, the bearer. Theodore of Mopsuestia well explains the <span class="greekheb">σφραγισάμ</span>. by <span class="greekheb">ἀποκομίσας καὶ δεδωκώς</span>, and adds, by way of assigning the reason: <span class="greekheb">εἰ γὰρ καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ τῶν δεδωκότων τέλειος ἦν ὁ καρπός</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τῇ χρεἰᾳ ἀτελὴς</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὔπω δεξαμένων ὧνπερ οὖν ἕνεκεν ἐδόθη</span>. Without any ground in the text, Hofmann introduces <span class="ital">bearers appointed on the part of the church</span>, whom the apostle himself conducts to Jerusalem, thereby designating the gift to the recipients as one <span class="ital">destined for them with his knowledge and will</span>. Hofmann’s objection, that the interpretation given above rather suggests that it should be termed an <span class="ital">unsealing</span> than a <span class="ital">sealing</span>, is a cavil running counter to the figurative usage elsewhere of <span class="greekheb">σφραγίζειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span>, and which might just as aptly be applied to Hofmann’s own explanation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο οὖν ἐπιτελέσας</span>: having brought this business to a close. It is a mistake to find in Paul’s use of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτελεῖν</span> any reference to the performance of a religious rite: see <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-3.htm" title="Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?">Galatians 3:3</a>, <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Php 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">σφραγισάμενος αὐτοῖς τὸν καρπὸν τοῦτον</span>. “This fruit” is, of course, the collection; it is one of the gracious results of the reception of the Gospel by the Gentiles, and Paul loves to conceive and to speak of it spiritually rather than materially. Thus in 2 Corinthians 8, 9 he calls it a <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, a <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>, a <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, a <span class="greekheb">ἁδρότης</span>, a <span class="greekheb">εὐλογία</span>: never money. The point of the figure in <span class="greekheb">σφραγισάμενος</span> cannot be said to be clear. It may possibly suggest that Paul, in handing over the money to the saints, <span class="ital">authenticates</span> it to them as the fruit of their <span class="greekheb">πνευματικά</span>, which have been sown among the Gentiles (so . and H.); or it may only mean “when I have <span class="ital">secured</span> this fruit to them <span class="ital">as their property</span>” (so Meyer). The ideas of “property,” “security,” “formality,” “solemnity,” “finality,” are all associated with <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span> and <span class="greekheb">σφραγίζω</span> in different passages of the N.T., and it is impossible to say which preponderated in Paul’s mind as he wrote these words. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>; <a href="/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπελεύσομαι</span> is simply <span class="ital">abibo:</span> the idea of <span class="ital">departing</span> from Jerusalem is included in it, which is not brought out in the R.V., “I will go on”. <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς Σπανίαν</span>: there is no evidence that this intention was ever carried out except the well-known passage in Clem. <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a> which speaks of Paul as having come <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ τέρμα τῆς δύσεως</span>: an expression which, especially if the writer was a Jew, may as well mean Rome as Spain. But all the more if it was not carried out is this passage in Romans assuredly genuine; a second-century writer would not gratuitously ascribe to an apostle intentions which he must have known were never accomplished.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">sealed</span>] The metaphor is from a solemn ratification. St Paul, handing over to the Church at Jerusalem the “fruit,” or proceeds, of the Macedonian and Achaian collections, would thereby finally <span class="ital">attest</span> it to be now the full property of the receivers: he would put the <span class="ital">seal of their ownership</span> upon it.—Meyer suggests that the word indicates also the solemn close of his apostolic work in the East. It is not clear, however, that he would view the transition from the E. to the W. of the Adriatic as a wholly peculiar crisis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπιτελέσας καὶ σφραγισάμενος</span>) Words nearly related to each other, <a href="/2_kings/22-4.htm" title="Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:">2 Kings 22:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">וְיַתֵּס אֶת־הַכֶּסֶף</span>, LXX., <span class="greekheb">καὶ σφράγισον τὸ ἀργύριον</span>, and seal the silver.

So man proposes, but God disposes, and all for final good (cf. <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.). That he afterwards carried out his intention of visiting Spain cannot be alleged with certainty, though there is distinct evidence of an early tradition that he did so (Canon Muratori, Eusebius, Jerome, Theodoret. Cf. Clem. Romans, Ep. 1, who speaks of St. Paul having gone to "the boundaries of the West"). Certainly before the end of his detention at Rome he had given up any idea he might have had of going thence at once to Spain; for cf. <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>; which Epistles are believed, on good grounds, to have been written during that detention. Still, he may have gone during the interval between his release and his final captivity at Rome, during which the pastoral Epistles were probably written. In what follows (vers. 30-32) some apprehension of dangers attending his visit to Jerusalem, which might possibly thwart his intentions, already appears; sounding like an undertone allaying the confidence of the hope previously expressed. In the course of his progress to Jerusalem this apprehension appears to have grown upon him; for see <a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22, 23, 28</a>; <a href="/acts/21-4.htm">Acts 21:4, 11-14</a>). It may be here observed that such signs, evidently unintentional, of conflicting feelings in the letter, and such consistency between the letter and the narrative, are strong confirmations of the genuineness of both. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Sealed - this fruit<p>Secured to them the product of the contribution.
