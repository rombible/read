<span class="ital">for the truth of God — </span>To demonstrate his faithfulness in fulfilling <span class="ital">the promises made unto the fathers </span>— Of sending them the Messiah; and therefore, 1st, The believing Jews, though weak, ought not to be despised by the believing Gentiles, though stronger. And, 2d, It is no objection to Christ’s receiving the Gentiles, that he never preached to them, for he became a minister of the circumcision, not only in order to the salvation of the Jews, but also that, by converting them, and sending them to preach to the Gentiles, he might accomplish the promises made to the fathers concerning the blessing of all nations. <span class="ital">And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, </span>as it is written, <a href="/psalms/18-49.htm" title="Therefore will I give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to your name.">Psalm 18:49</a>; where the Gentiles and Jews are spoken of as joining in the worship of the true God, the God of Israel. To explain this more fully, “Jesus Christ was born a Jew, and exercised his ministry among the Jews, in order that the truth of God’s promises to the fathers, concerning the blessing of the nations in Abraham’s seed, might be confirmed by the conversion of the Jews and Gentiles. For as the Jews were the only people on earth who worshipped the true God, and had his revelations in their hands, it was absolutely necessary that the gospel, in which all the former revelations terminated, should be first preached to them; that a sufficient number of them receiving it, might preach it to the Gentiles, as the fulfilment of the former revelations, of which their nation were the keepers. The gospel being thus offered to the Gentiles, as the word of the same God who anciently spoke to the fathers of the Jewish nation by the prophets; that circumstance, with the miracles which accompanied the first preaching of it, so powerfully demonstrated it to be from God, that multitudes of the Gentiles, receiving it, turned from idols to worship the living and true God; whereby the truth of God’s promise to the fathers, concerning the blessing of the nations in Christ, was illustriously confirmed, and the Gentiles had an opportunity of glorifying God for his mercy in their conversion.” It may be proper to observe further here, that “conversion to the true God being the <span class="ital">mercy, </span>or blessing, which God promised to bestow on the Gentiles, it is particularly mentioned here, not only to make the Gentiles sensible that they ought not to despise the Jews, through whom they had received so great a blessing, but also to persuade the Jews to acknowledge the Gentiles as the people of God, equally with themselves.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">And again Moses saith, </span>(<a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>,) <span class="ital">Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people </span>— Implying that the time would come when the Gentiles should become the people of God as well as the Jews, and should join with them in the worship of God, and rejoice in a sense of his goodness to them. <span class="ital">And again, </span>(<a href="/psalms/117-1.htm" title="O praise the LORD, all you nations: praise him, all you people.">Psalm 117:1</a>,) <span class="ital">Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, </span>for the mercy vouchsafed to you; therefore they shall know God, and obtain mercy; <span class="ital">and Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse </span>— See note on <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm" title="And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.">Isaiah 11:10</a>. The apostle here follows the translation of the LXX., because, though it differs in expression from the Hebrew, it represents the prophet’s meaning with sufficient exactness to prove the point for which he quotes it, which was to show that the Gentiles should become the people of God by believing, and confiding in the Messiah, and therefore should be united in the same church with the believing Jews. And the apostle’s design in this part of his epistle being to persuade the Jewish and Gentile converts to a cordial union in the public worship of God, it was of great importance to show the Jews that this coalition was foretold in their own Scriptures; for which purpose the apostle, with great propriety, quotes the various passages here adduced.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:8-13 Christ fulfilled the prophecies and promises relating to the Jews, and the Gentile converts could have no excuse for despising them. The Gentiles, being brought into the church, are companions in patience and tribulation. They should praise God. Calling upon all the nations to praise the Lord, shows that they shall have knowledge of him. We shall never seek to Christ till we trust in him. And the whole plan of redemption is suited to reconcile us to one another, as well as to our gracious God, so that an abiding hope of eternal life, through the sanctifying and comforting power of the Holy Spirit, may be attained. Our own power will never reach this; therefore where this hope is, and is abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all the glory. All joy and peace; all sorts of true joy and peace, so as to suppress doubts and fears, through the powerful working of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I say - I affirm, or maintain. I, a "Jew," admit that his work had reference to the Jews; I affirm also that it had reference to the Gentiles.<p>That Jesus Christ - That "the Messiah." The force of the apostle's reasoning would often be more striking if he would retain the word "Messiah," and not regard the word "Christ" as a mere surname. It is the name of his "office;" and to "a Jew" the name "Messiah" would convey much more than the idea of a mere proper name.<p>Was a minister of the circumcision - Exercized his office - the office of the Messiah - among the Jews, or with respect to the Jews, for the purposes which he immediately specifies. He was born a Jew; was circumcised; came "to" that nation; and died in their midst, without having gone himself to any other people.<p>For the truth of God - To confirm or establish the truth of the promises of God. He remained among them in the exercise of his ministry, to show that God was "true," who had said that the Messiah should come to them.<p>To confirm the promises ... - To "establish," or to show that the promises were true; see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25-26</a>. The "promises" referred to here, are those particularly which related to the coming of the Messiah. By thus admitting that the Messiah was the minister of the circumcision, the apostle conceded all that the Jew could ask, that he was to be peculiarly "their" Messiah; see the note at <a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-12.

Or affirm that Christ has received both Jews and Gentiles: that he has received the Jews, and therefore they are not to be despised, though they are weak, appears from hence, <p>that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision; he is rightly called a minister, for this was the end of his coming into the world, and the whole of his work in it was not to be ministered unto, but to minister to others, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, both in life and at death. This character agrees with him in all his offices; as King he ministers judgment to the people; and as priest he is the minister of the true tabernacle of the human nature, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a>, in which he offered himself a sacrifice for the sins of his people, and now in it makes intercession for them; but here it is expressive of his prophetic office, in which he is such a minister as never was before, or since, or ever will be; if we consider the dignity of his person, being the Son of God; the greatness of his qualifications, having the Spirit without measure; the nature of his doctrines, which were amazing words of grace and truth; and the manner of his delivery, which was with authority; and that all other ministers receive their mission, qualifications, doctrine and success from him: he is styled a minister of "the circumcision", not literally considered, as if he administered circumcision to any, which he did not; he was indeed subject to it as a son of Abraham, as a Jew by birth, as under the law, and in order to fulfil all righteousness, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>, and to show that he was truly man, and that he had regard to the people and ordinances of the Old Testament, as he showed by baptism he had to those of the New, and to signify our cleansing and atonement by his blood; but circumcision is either to be understood in a spiritual sense of circumcision in the Spirit, and not in the flesh, with which the true circumcision, or believers in Christ, are circumcised in him, through his circumcision; or rather the word here is to be taken metonymically, for the uncircumcised Jews, as it often is in this epistle; see <a href="/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>. So that the meaning is, that Christ was their minister and preacher, just as Peter is said to have the apostleship of the circumcision, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>, or to be the apostle of the Jews; as Paul was of the Gentiles, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>, and to have the Gospel of the circumcision committed to him, it being his province to preach it to them, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7</a>, Christ as a minister or preacher in the personal discharge of his prophetic office, was sent only to the Jews; among them he lived, and to them he only preached; nor did he allow his apostles to preach to any other till after his resurrection; and which is a manifest proof that he received the Jews, and took them under his care, and showed a particular regard unto them: the ends of his being a minister to them were, <p>for the truth of God; to preach the Gospel of salvation, the word of truth unto them, for which he was promised and sent; and in doing of which he declared the righteousness, faithfulness, loving kindness, and truth of God unto them: <p>and to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; the fathers of the world, Adam, Noah, &amp;c. or rather the Jewish fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and others; concerning the Messiah's being the seed of the woman, and of Abraham, and of David; concerning the coming of Shiloh, the raising up of the great prophet among the Jews, &amp;c. all which promises are yea and amen in Christ, ratified and fulfilled in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> circumcision for the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> truth of God, to confirm the promises <i>made</i> unto the fathers:</span><p>(5) An applying of the example of Christ to the Jews, whom he granted this honour for the promises which he made to their fathers, although they were ever so unworthy, in that he executed the office of a minister among them with marvellous patience: therefore much less ought the Gentiles despise them for certain faults, whom the Son of God esteemed so much.<p>(f) Of the circumcised Jews, for as long as he lived, he never went out of their midst.<p>(g) That God might be seen to be true.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:...">Romans 15:8-9</a>.

Moreover, the <span class="ital">aorist</span> infinitive necessarily leads to <span class="ital">this</span>, that <span class="greekheb">δοξάσαι</span> is parallel to the preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΕΒΑΙῶΣΑΙ</span></span></span>, and consequently is not governed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> at all, but is connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤῸ</span></span></span>, as Castalio and Beza have rightly perceived; comp. also Bengel (“<span class="ital">glorificarent</span>”) and van Hengel. Hence: “in order that He might ratify the promises of the fathers, <span class="ital">but that the Gentiles, on behalf of mercy, might praise God</span>.” The former, namely, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἀληθείας Θεοῦ εἰς τὸ βεβαιῶσαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., was the <span class="ital">proximate</span> design of Christ’s having become minister of the circumcised; and the <span class="ital">more remote</span> design, which was to be attained through the passing of salvation from the Jews to the Gentiles (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>), consisted in this, <span class="ital">that on the other hand the Gentiles should praise God on account of mercy</span>.

St. Paul, after a manner usual with him; follows cut a thought suggested in the course of his argument, so as to interrupt the latter for a while, but to return to it in ver. 13. All, in fact, from the beginning of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 12, is parenthetical, suggested by "even as Christ received you,." at the end of ver. 7. All this, it may be observed, is confirmatory of Pauline authorship.
