And the providence of God seemed, in a special manner, to prevent his preaching where others had preached, (though not entirely,) lest his enemies, who sought every occasion to set light by him, should have had room to say that he was behind other apostles, not being sufficient for planting churches himself, but only for preaching where others had prepared his way; or that he declined the more difficult part of the ministry. <span class="ital">But as it is written </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to that prophecy which is now fulfilling in my ministry; <span class="ital">to whom he was not spoken of </span>— Namely, the Gentiles; <span class="ital">they shall see </span>— See on <a href="/isaiah/52-15.htm" title="So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.">Isaiah 52:15</a>. <span class="ital">And they that have not heard </span>— In former times; <span class="ital">shall understand </span>— And obey the gospel. <span class="ital">For which cause </span>— That I might not build on another man’s foundation; <span class="ital">I have been much hindered from coming to you </span>— Among whom Christ had been named.

He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, so have I strived - The word used here &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  philotimoumenon means properly "to be ambitious, to be studious of honor;" and then to "desire" earnestly.

Others might be called to edify the church, but he regarded it as his function to make known the name of the Saviour where it was not before known. This work was particularly adapted to the ardor, zeal, energy, and bravery of such a man as Paul. Every man has his proper gift; and there are some particularly suited to "found" and establish churches; others to edify and comfort them; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13-16</a>.

In the compact between St. Paul and the apostles of the circumcision referred to in <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1-7</a>, it was agreed that he should confine his apostolic ministry to the Gentiles. Consequently, we find him selecting as centres of his work the principal cities of the heathen world. But he was further careful to avoid places, wherever they might be, in which Churches were already founded. It was the function of an apostle to extend the gospel by founding new Churches, rather than to invade the provinces of others. Those founded by himself, and thus under his immediate jurisdiction, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Corinthian Church, he visited as need arose, and addressed them in authoritative letters, commanding as well as exhorting. But his rule in this respect did not preclude his writing also letters of general encouragement and admonition to any whom his peculiar commission as apostle of the Gen- tiles gave him a claim to be heard by. Thus he wrote to the Colossians, though he had never seen them (<a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>); and thus also to the Romans, at the same time (as we have seen, <a href="/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, seq.) almost apologizing for doing so; and, though he proposes visiting them, it is nor with the view of staying among them long, so as to take up the superintendence of them, but only on his way to Spain for mutual comfort and edification (see <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Have I strived (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb means originally to be fond of honor, and hence, from a love of honor, to strive, be ambitious.
