Holding this good opinion of you as I do, I nevertheless presumed somewhat upon my position as an Apostle, and especially as an Apostle of the.

In some passages the Apostle feels that he had gone beyond the modest limits which he might have seemed to mark out for himself by what he had just been saying. He had taken a liberty, but not too great a liberty. He had spoken to them rather pointedly at times, but he had been careful not to go too far. The reference may be supposed to be to exhortations such as those in Romans 13, 14, and in other parts of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">As putting you in mind.</span>—Another delicate expression. The Apostle has not been telling them of something that they did not know before, but merely reminding them of what they knew. And he claims the right to do this because of the special grace given to him as an Apostle. The Judaising section in the Church at Rome did not go so far as that in Galatia. It recognised the apostleship of St. Paul, and he knew that he could safely appeal to this recognition.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the grace.</span>—Comp. “grace and apostleship” in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>. “Grace” is here that special endowment with divine gifts by which the Apostles were distinguished from other Christians.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless - Notwithstanding my full persuasion of your knowledge and your purpose to do right. Perhaps he refers also to the fact that he was a stranger to them.<p>The more boldly - More boldly than might have been expected from a stranger. The reason why he showed this boldness in declaring his sentiments, he immediately states - that he had been especially called to the function of instructing the Gentiles.<p>In some sort - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  apo meros. In part. Some have supposed that he referred to a "party" at Rome - the Gentile party (Whitby). Some refer it to different "parts" of his epistle - on some subjects (Stuart). Probably the expression is designed to qualify the phrase "more boldly." The phrase, says Grotius, "diminishes" that of which it is spoken, as <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">2 Corinthians 2:5</a>; and means the same as "somewhat more freely;" that is, I have been induced to write the more freely, "partly" because I am appointed to this very office. I write somewhat more freely to a church among the Gentiles than I even should to one among the Jews, "because" I am appointed to this very office.<p>As putting you in mind - Greek, Calling to your "remembrance," or "reminding" you; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12-13</a>. This was a delicate way of communicating instruction. The apostles presumed that all Christians were acquainted with the great doctrines of religion; but they did not command, enjoin, or assume a spirit; of dictation. How happy would it be if all teachers would imitate the example of the "apostles" in this, and be as modest and humble "as they were."<p>Because of the grace ... - Because God has conferred the favor on me of appointing me to this function; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

It is just such entirely doctrinal discussions as chap. 9, 10 which answer least to the character of <span class="greekheb">τολμηρότερον</span>, which presupposes the ready possibility of <span class="ital">offence</span> being given. The exculpation implied in ver. 15 is not calculated for a Jewish-Christian church (Mangold, p. 72), but rather for a church as yet strange to the apostle and held in very good repute, towards which he felt himself not in a like relation as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> to the Galatians and Corinthians, but in one more delicate and calling for more forbearance. Artfully and gently, too, is the <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀναμιμν</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. added, as if what was written <span class="greekheb">τολμηρότερον</span> was only meant to be a help to <span class="ital">their memory</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνάμνησις δʼ ἐστὶν ἐπιῤῥοὴ φρονήσεως ἀπολειπούσης</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. v. p. 732 B.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/15-15.htm" title="Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,">Romans 15:15</a> f. <span class="greekheb">τολμηροτέρως</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ μέρους</span>: the description does not apply to the letter as a whole, but only to parts of it: Gifford refers to <a href="/context/romans/6-12.htm" title="Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof....">Romans 6:12-21</a>, <a href="/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a> ff., <a href="/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>, and especially chap. 14 throughout. <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐπαναμιμνήσκων ὑμᾶς</span>: here only in N.T. There is the same courteous tone as in <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a> f. He does not presume to teach them what they do not know, but only to suggest to their memory what they must know already but may be overlooking. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν χάριν τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι</span>: this is the real justification of his writing. As in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>, <a href="/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>, the <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> is that of Apostleship. It is not wantonly, but in the exercise of a Divine vocation, and a divinely-bestowed competence for it, that he writes. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναί με λειτουργὸν Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ εἰς τὰ ἔθνη</span>: there is a certain emphasis on <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ ἔθνη</span>, and the whole sentence would be inept, as a justification of Paul for writing to Rome, unless the Roman Church had been essentially Gentile. For <span class="greekheb">λειτουργὸν</span> see note on <a href="/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a>. The word here derives from the context the priestly associations which often attach to it in the LXX. But obviously it has no bearing on the question as to the “sacerdotal” character of the Christian ministry. The offering which Paul conceives himself as presenting to God is the Gentile Church, and the priestly function in the exercise of which this offering is made is the preaching of the Gospel. Paul describes himself as <span class="greekheb">ἱερουργοῦντα τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ θεοῦ</span> <span class="ital">sacerdotis modo evangelium administrantem</span>. Fritzsche (on whose note all later expositors depend) explains the <span class="ital">sacerdotis modo</span> by <span class="ital">accurate et religiose</span>; just as a Levitical offering was not acceptable to God unless the prescribed ceremonial was precisely observed, so the offering of the Gentiles at God’s altar would be unacceptable unless Paul showed a priestlike fidelity in his ministry of the Gospel. But this is to wring from a word what an intelligent appreciation of the sentence as a whole, and especially of its pictorial character, refuses to yield: the clause <span class="greekheb">ἵνα γένηται</span> … <span class="greekheb">εὐπρόσδεκτος</span> depends not on <span class="greekheb">ἱερουργοῦντα</span>, but on the whole conception of Paul’s ministry, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, on <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναί με λειτουργὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ἡ προσφορὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν</span>, genitive of object, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>. This great offering is acceptable to God (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>) because it is <span class="greekheb">ἡγιασμένη</span> consecrated to Him <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span>. Those who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, as the result of Paul’s sacred ministry of the Gospel, received the Holy Spirit: this (as distinct from the ceremonial “without spot or blemish”) was the ground of their acceptance (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a> f.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">I have written</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">I wrote</span>; the “epistolary past.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the more boldly</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">more boldly</span>; i.e., in our idiom, <span class="bld">somewhat boldly</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in some sort</span>] More lit., and better, <span class="bld">in part</span>; i.e. <span class="bld">here and there</span>. He refers to occasional passages such as <a href="/context/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you....">Romans 6:17-21</a>, <a href="/context/romans/9-19.htm" title="You will say then to me, Why does he yet find fault?

Such is evidently the tone of both the doctrinal and practical passages of the Epistle, taken as a whole.

He says, that the degree of <span class="ital">boldness</span> on his part consisted in the very fact of writing at all, not in the manner of writing. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ</span>, <span class="ital">because of</span>, depends on, <span class="ital">I have written</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ μέρους</span>, <span class="ital">in part</span>) [<span class="ital">in some sort</span>, Engl.

Though the Church of Rome was not one of his own foundation, and he had no desire, there or elsewhere, to build on another man's foundation (ver. 20), yet his peculiar mission as apostle to the Gentiles gave him a claim to admonish them. The reason thus given is, it will be observed, a confirmation of the view, otherwise apparent, that the Roman Church consisted principally of Gentile believers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I have written (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;)<p>Rev., I write.
