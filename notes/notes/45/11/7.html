Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded....">Romans 11:7-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">What then </span>— What is the conclusion from the whole? It is this, that <span class="ital">Israel, </span>in general, <span class="ital">hath not obtained that which he seeketh </span>— Namely, justification, acceptance with God, and the blessings consequent thereon. <span class="ital">But the election </span>— Those of them only who repent and believe, and therefore are chosen of God to be his people; <span class="ital">have obtained it, and the rest were blinded </span>— By their own wilful prejudice, arising from their worldly spirit, which caused them to reject Jesus on account of his poverty, mean appearance, and state of suffering. The word <span class="greekheb">επωρωθησαν</span>, here rendered, <span class="ital">were blinded, </span>signifies properly, <span class="ital">were hardened, </span>being a metaphorical expression taken from the skin of the hand, made hard by labour. In general it denotes, in Scripture, both hardness of heart, and blindness of understanding. “The apostle’s meaning is, that the unbelieving Jews, through the influence of their own evil dispositions, were so blinded, that they did not discern the force of the evidence by which God confirmed the mission of his Son, and so were excluded from his covenant and church.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">According as it is written </span>— Here the apostle refers to two passages of Isaiah, chap. <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm" title="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="/romans/6-9.htm" title="Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.">Romans 6:9</a>, &c. <span class="ital">God hath given them the spirit of slumber </span>— Or <span class="ital">deep sleep, </span>as the <span class="ital">word </span><span class="greekheb">κατανυξεως </span>signifies, being used with an allusion to the stupifying potions which were sometimes given to persons who were to suffer torture or death, to render them insensible. The meaning here is, God hath at length withdrawn his Spirit, and for their wilful impenitence, unbelief, and obstinacy, hath given them up to a state of blindness and insensibility, whereby they slumber, as it were, on the brink of ruin, and are careless about their salvation; while the wrath of God hangs over theft heads, and the divine judgments are ready to break forth upon them, in a most awful manner. <span class="ital">Eyes that they should not see — </span>Here the apostle alludes to <a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm" title="Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>, where see the note. As if the apostle had said, Being forsaken of God, they are like to a man bereft of his senses: or he has given them up to such stupidity of mind, that though they have eyes yet they see not. <span class="ital">Unto this day </span>— So it was then, and so it is still. <span class="ital">And </span>— To show the causes and consequences of that spiritual blindness; <span class="ital">David saith </span>— Speaking prophetically of the Messiah’s enemies; <span class="ital">Let their table be made a snare </span>— Or, as the words may be rendered, <span class="ital">Their table shall be for a snare to them, </span>&c. That is, the plentiful provision God has made for the supply of their wants, ghostly or bodily, being abused, shall become an occasion of sin and mischief to them; and their blessings shall be turned into curses, by reason of their depravity. The metaphors of a <span class="ital">snare </span>and a <span class="ital">trap </span>are taken from birds and beasts, which are allured into snares and traps to their destruction, by meat laid in their way. <span class="ital">Stumbling-blocks </span>occasion falls, which sometimes wound to death. <span class="ital">And a recompense </span>— A punishment as a recompense of their preceding wickedness. Thus sin is punished by sin; and thus the gospel, which should have fed and strengthened their souls, becomes a means of destroying them. <span class="ital">Let their eyes, </span>&c. — As if he had said, And in them the following words are also fulfilled: <span class="ital">Their eyes shall be darkened — </span>Not the eyes of their bodies, (for in that sense the prediction was neither fulfilled in David’s nor in Christ’s enemies,) but of their minds, so that they will not discern God’s truth nor their own duty, nor the way of peace and salvation. <span class="ital">And bow down their back alway </span>— Under a perpetual weight of sorrows, which they will not be able to support, and which will be a just punishment upon them for their having rejected so easy a yoke. The <span class="ital">darkening of the eyes, </span>and the <span class="ital">bowing down of the back, </span>denote the greatest affliction. For grief is said to make the eyes dim, <a href="/lamentations/5-17.htm" title="For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.">Lamentations 5:17</a>; and a most miserable slavery is represented by walking with the back bowed down, as under a yoke or heavy burden, <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm" title="The LORD opens the eyes of the blind: the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD loves the righteous:">Psalm 146:8</a>. They loved darkness rather than light, and therefore were permitted by the righteous judgment of God to go on in darkness, while the blind led the blind. And such still continues to be the state of the Jews, notwithstanding the intolerable load of wo which in all ages, since their rejection of the Messiah, has bowed down their backs to the earth. By quoting these prophecies, the apostle showed the Jews that their rejection and punishment for crucifying the Messiah, was long ago foretold in their own Scriptures. It is justly observed by Macknight here, that “God’s ancient Israel, given up to deep sleep, to blind eyes, and deaf ears, and with the back bowed down continually, is an example which ought to terrify all who enjoy the gospel, lest by abusing it they bring themselves into the like miserable condition.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What then? - What is the proper conclusion from this argument? "Israel hath not obtained." That is, the Jews as a people have not obtained what they sought. They sought the favor of God by their own merit; and as it was impossible to obtain it in that manner, they have, as a people, failed of obtaining his favor at all, and will be rejected.<p>That which he seeketh for - To wit, salvation by their own obedience to the Law.<p>The election hath - The purpose of choosing on the part of God has obtained, or secured, what the seeking on the part of the Jews could not secure. Or the abstract here may be put for the concrete, and the word "election" may mean the same as the elect. The elect, the reserved, the chosen part of the people, have obtained the favor of God.<p>Hath obtained it - That is, the favor, or mercy, of God.<p>The rest - The great mass of the people who remained in unbelief, and had rejected the Messiah.<p>Were blinded - The word in the original means also were hardened &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  epo&#772;ro&#772;the&#772;san. It comes from a word which signifies properly to become hard, as bones do which are broken and are then united; or as the joints sometimes do when they become callous or stiff. It was probably applied also to the formation of a hard substance in the eye, a cataract; and then means the same as to be blinded. Hence, applied to the mind, it means what is "hard, obdurate, insensible, stupid." Thus, it is applied to the Jews, and means that they were blind and obstinate; see <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>, "Their heart was hardened;" <a href="/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>. The word does not occur in any other place in the New Testament. This verse affirms simply that "the rest were hardened," but it does not affirm anything about the mode by which it was done. In regard to "the election," it is affirmed that it was of God; <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>. Of the remainder, the fact of their blindness is simply mentioned, without affirming anything of the cause; see <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-10.

The antithesis requires that he should have said: The rest have not obtained; but he speaks this of purpose to show the cause of their not obtaining, i.e. their own blindness of mind and hardness of heart. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>What then?.... What can be said to the point the apostle is upon? it is as clear as the sun, out of all question, that God has not cast away all the people of the Jews, nor any whom he foreknew, any age or period of time; neither in the time Elijah, nor in the apostle's, he always having a reserve of some for himself; which reserve is owing to a previous choice of them, and that previous choice to ascribed not to any works of theirs, but to his free grace and sovereign pleasure. Indeed <p>Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; that is, carnal Israel, the body and bulk of that people; who sought for life and righteousness by their obedience to the law, and which they in general were in quest of, and pursuit after, but did not obtain, though, some of them might imagine they did; for the thing was impracticable and impossible, no life nor righteousness are ever to be had by the law of works; they did not obtain life and righteousness, because they sought them in a wrong place and in a wrong way; they sought them not by faith in Christ Jesus, where they are only to be had, but by their own works, which fall abundantly short of procuring them for them: <p>but the election hath obtained it. The apostle divides Israel into two parts, "the election and the rest": by "the election" he means, elect men, the remnant among them, whom God had reserved for himself; just as "circumcision" designs circumcised persons, and "uncircumcision" uncircumcised persons, and "calling" called ones, and "righteousness" righteous men and women; see <a href="/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a> <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>. Now these chosen ones obtained mercy, grace, life, and righteousness in Christ, as the apostle himself did, who was one of them; and that by virtue, and in consequence of their election, for which reason the word is here used; hence mercy was shown them, grace was bestowed upon them, the righteousness of Christ was imputed to them, faith was given them, holiness was wrought in them, and they entitled to, and made meet for eternal life: these among Israel then obtained such favours and blessings; and so God's elect, in all ages and nations, obtain the same things, and will obtain; for the purpose of God according to election stands sure, his word and oath are immutable, his covenant inviolable, his grace inalienable, and his power omnipotent: <p>and the rest were blinded: the non-elect, or those who were not chosen and reserved, to whom Christ was "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence"; and who "stumbled at the word" of the Gospel, "being disobedient" to the divine revelation, "whereunto they were appointed", <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>; hence they obtained no mercy, grace, faith, life, righteousness, and eternal salvation, but were "blinded"; left in that native blindness and ignorance, in which they were born and brought up; were blinded by themselves wilfully more and more; as they knew not the Messiah, so neither would they understand; they sinned wilfully against light knowledge; they shut their eyes against all that evidence and demonstration given, of Jesus of Nazareth being the Messiah, by his doctrines and miracles; and they were blinded by Satan, the god of this world, by whom they were led captive; who wrought effectually in them, and stirred up the malice and enmity of their minds against Christ and his Gospel; for they were of their father the devil, and his lusts they would do; and they were also blinded by God himself, so that they could not believe; for after all this, it was but just with God to give them up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What then?

Hofmann also takes <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐπιζητεῖ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπέτυχεν</span> as a question, but in the sense whether that which Israel has not obtained is <span class="ital">the same thing</span> as that to which its quest and striving tends (namely, its own righteousness)?

This complete distortion of the sense falls to the ground from the very fact, that for the second <span class="greekheb">ἐπέτυχεν</span>, since <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐπιζητεῖ</span> is not appended, no other object can be thought of without the greatest arbitrariness than that of the first <span class="greekheb">ἐπέτυχεν</span>, namely <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐπιζητεῖ Ἰσραήλ</span>; and also, as respects the contents of the question, from the consideration, that if we should not be able to say that Israel has not obtained that for which it strove, this would stand in contradiction to the universal Pauline dogma of the impossibility of righteousness by the law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπιζητεῖ</span> does not denote the <span class="ital">zealous</span> pursuit (Fritzsche, Philippi), but its <span class="ital">direction</span>, correlative to <span class="greekheb">ἐπέτυχεν</span>.

The verb rendered “harden” there is not the same, but the idea is the same.
