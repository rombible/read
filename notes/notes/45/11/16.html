Their forefathers were the first recipients of the promise, and what they were it is only natural to hope that their descendants will be. When a piece of dough is taken from the lump to make a consecrated cake, the consecration of the part extends over the whole; and the character which is inherent in the root of a tree shows itself also in the branches. So we may believe that the latter end of Israel will be like its beginning. The consecration that was imparted to it in the founders of the race we may expect to see resumed by their descendants, even though it is for a time interrupted.<p><span class= "bld">The firstfruit</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">the lump.</span>—The allusion here is to the custom, described in <a href="/context/numbers/15-19.htm" title="Then it shall be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up an heave offering to the LORD.">Numbers 15:19-21</a>, of dedicating a portion of the dough to God. The portion thus taken was to be a “heave-offering”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it was to be “waved,” or “heaved,” before the Lord, and was then given to the priest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches....">Romans 11:16-17</a></span>. And their conversion will surely be effected, <span class="ital">For if the first- fruit </span>of them, the patriarchs, <span class="ital">be holy </span>— He alludes to the waved sheaf, which was said to be <span class="ital">holy, </span>because it was accepted of God, in token of his giving the appointed weeks of the harvest: and by the <span class="ital">first-fruit, </span>he either means the patriarchs, who were called and separated to the service of God from all the people of the earth; or, as many commentators understand him, the first converts to Christianity from among the Jews, teaching that they were most acceptable to God, as being the first members of the newly- erected Christian church. <span class="ital">The lump is also holy — The lump, </span><span class="greekheb">φυραμα</span>, (which was the meal tempered with water, and kneaded for baking,) here denotes the mass of which the two wave-loaves were made, mentioned <a href="/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>. And as these were offered at the conclusion of the harvest, seven weeks after the offering of the first-fruits, they represented the whole fruits of the earth newly gathered in, as sanctified through that offering for the people’s use, during the following year. By this latter similitude, therefore, the apostle intends the whole mass, or body of the nation, to be hereafter converted, and rendered acceptable to God, as members of his true church. <span class="ital">And if the root </span>of them, namely, Abraham, <span class="ital">was holy </span>and beloved of God, <span class="ital">so are the branches </span>still beloved for the father’s sake, and so will be once more, in his good time, admitted to his favour. There seems here to be an allusion to <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm" title="Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.">Jeremiah 2:16</a>, where the Jewish nation, made the visible church of God by virtue of the covenant at Sinai, are represented under the figure of <span class="ital">a green olive-tree, </span>of which Abraham was <span class="ital">the root, </span>and his descendants by Isaac <span class="ital">the branches. </span>Hence the thrusting the Jews out of the covenant of God, is here represented by the <span class="ital">breaking off of the branches; </span>and the admission of the Gentiles into that covenant, so as to make them members of God’s church, is set forth under the idea of their being <span class="ital">ingrafted into the stock of the green olive-tree; </span>and the advantages which they enjoyed thereby, are expressed by their partaking of the <span class="ital">root and fatness of the olive-tree. </span>The expression, <span class="ital">a wild olive-tree, </span>means here, <span class="ital">a branch of a wild olive-tree, </span>for <span class="ital">branches </span>only are ingrafted.

As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if the first-fruit be holy - The word "first-fruit" &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;  aparche&#772; used here denotes the firstling of fruit or grain which was separated from the mass and presented as an offering to God. The Jews were required to present such a portion of their harvest to God, as an expression of gratitude and of their sense of dependence; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19-21</a>. Until this was done, it was not lawful to partake of the harvest. The offering of this was regarded as rendering the mass holy, that is, it was lawful then to partake of it. The first-fruits were regarded as among the best portions of the harvest; and it was their duty to devote to God that which would be the best expression of their thanksgiving. This was the general practice in relation to all that the land produced. The expression here, however, has reference to the small portion of dough or kneaded meal that was offered to God; and then the mass or lump &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  phurama was left for the use of him who made the offering; <a href="/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20</a>.<p>Be holy - Be set apart, or consecrated to God, as he commanded.<p>The lump - The mass. It refers here properly to the dough of which a part had been offered. The same was true also in relation to the harvest, after the waive-sheaf had been offered; of the flock, after the first male had been offered, etc.<p>Is also holy - It is lawful then for the owner to partake of it. The offering of a part has consecrated the whole. By this illustration Paul doubtless means to say that the Jewish nation, as a people, were set apart to the service of God, and were so regarded by him. Some have supposed that by the first-fruit here the apostle intends to refer to the early converts, made to the Christian faith in the first preaching of the gospel. But it is more probable that he refers to the patriarchs, the pious people of old, as the first-fruits of the Jewish nation; see <a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>. By their piety the nation was, in a manner, sanctified, or set apart to the service of God; implying that yet the great mass of them would be reclaimed and saved.<p>If the root be holy - This figure expresses the same thing as is denoted in the first part of the verse. The root of a tree is the source of nutritious juices necessary for its growth, and gives its character to the tree. If that be sound, pure, vigorous, we expect the same of the branches. A root bears a similar relation to the tree that the first-fruit does to the mass of bread. Perhaps there is allusion here to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>, where the Jewish nation is represented under the image of "a green olivetree, fair, and of goodly fruit." In this place the reference is doubtless to Abraham and the patriarchs, as the root or founders of the Jewish nation. If they were holy, it is to be expected that the distant branches, or descendants, would also be so regarded. The mention of the root and branches of a tree gives the apostle occasion for an illustration of the relation at that time of the Jews and Gentiles to the church of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. For&#8212;"But"<p>if the first-fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root &#8230; so the branches&#8212;The Israelites were required to offer to God the first-fruits of the earth&#8212;both in their raw state, in a sheaf of newly reaped grain (Le 23:10, 11), and in their prepared state, made into cakes of dough (Nu 15:19-21)&#8212;by which the whole produce of that season was regarded as hallowed. It is probable that the latter of these offerings is here intended, as to it the word "lump" best applies; and the argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth, so, in the divine estimation, it was as real a separation of the mass or "lump" of that nation in all time to God. The figure of the "root" and its "branches" is of like import&#8212;the consecration of the one of them extending to the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is another argument to prove the Jews are not finally rejected, because of the covenant made with their fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If the first-fruit be holy:</span> some make a difference between <span class="ital">the first-fruit, </span> and <span class="ital">the root, </span> in the latter part of the verse.

The great question is, In what sense they are said to be <span class="ital">holy?</span> Or of what holiness doth he speak? It is not meant of inherent, but of federal, or covenant holiness; all in all outward and visible covenant with God, were called <span class="ital">holy:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/9-6.htm" title="And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.">Exodus 9:6</a> <a href="/daniel/8-24.htm" title="And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.">Daniel 8:24</a></span>.

In such a sense as this, the Jews are still a holy people; they have an hereditary kind of dedication to God; they have a federal holiness, and relation to God, as being for ever separated to him, in the loins of their progenitors; this can never be wholly forfeited, as being granted to all the posterity of the holy patriarchs: therefore they are called <span class="ital">the children of the covenant, which God made with their fathers, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/3-25.htm" title="You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.">Acts 3:25</a></span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a></span>.

Some by "the firstfruit" and "root" understand Christ, who is sometimes called, "the firstfruits of them that slept", <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, and "the root of Jesse and David", <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, and indeed of all the righteous; and certain it is, that since he is holy, has all the holiness of his people in him, and is sanctification unto them, they shall be holy likewise; have it imparted to them in this life, and perfected in them in another: but this does not seem to agree with the apostle's argument. Others think that by them are meant the Jewish ancestors, and particularly Abraham, and dream of a holiness derived from him to his natural seed; but if no such holiness was derived from him to his immediate offspring, Ishmael, it can hardly be thought any should be communicated by him to his remote posterity; and to these here designed, at the distance of four or five thousand years from him: but by them are intended the first converts among the Jews, under the Gospel dispensation; it being usual with the apostle to call those persons, that were first converted in any place, the firstfruits of it; see <a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; These were they who received the firstfruits of the Spirit in Judea, and who first among the Jews hoped and believed in Christ; these were but few in number, as the "firstfruit" is but small in comparison of "the lump", and mean, abject, and despicable, as the "root" under, and in a dry ground is; but yet were pledges and presages of a larger number of souls among that people, to be converted in the latter day: now the apostle's argument is, "if the firstfruit be holy", <p>the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches; that is, that whereas those persons who were converted among the Jews, however few in number, and despicable in appearance they might be, yet were truly sanctified by the Spirit of God; and as they were, so should the whole body of that people be in the last days, "when holiness shall be upon the horses' bells, and every pot in Judah and Jerusalem shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts", <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>, by which metaphorical expressions is meant, that holiness should be common to the whole nation, and all the inhabitants of it, of which the call of some few among them was a pledge and presage. The allusion in the former clause is to the holy offerings of firstfruits to the Lord, the two wave loaves, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>, whereby the whole lump was sanctified, for after use throughout the year following; and that in the latter clause, to the holiness of trees; that is, to trees devoted to sacred use or that were planted in a field appropriated thereunto: hence we read (t), that the men of Jericho permitted, or as other exemplars read it, cut down  , "branches of holiness", or "holy branches"; and eat fallen fruit on the sabbath day. (u) Bartenora explains these branches, of such that grow upon a tree devoted to holy uses; and Maimonides (w), observes, that they thought it lawful to eat what grew in a holy field. <p>(t) Misn.

Therefore in judging of our brethren, we must not dwell on their unworthiness, to think that they are at once all cast off, but we ought to consider the root of the covenant, and rather go back to their ancestors who were faithful, that we may know that the blessing of the covenant rests in some of their posterity, as we also find proof here in ourselves.<p>(o) He alludes to the first fruits of those loaves, by the offering of which the whole crop of corn was sanctified, and they might use the rest of the crop for that year with good conscience.<p>(p) Abraham.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.">Romans 11:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] continuative; but this <span class="greekheb">πρόσληψις</span>, how well it corresponds to the character of holiness, which has been associated with the people of Israel from its origin till now!

But in that case <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span> obtains a genitival definition not presented by the text; and this can the less be approved, since <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχὴ φυράματος</span>, in fact, was the stated expression from Num. <span class="ital">l.c.</span> This applies also against Hofmann, who likewise explains the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span> as the firstling-<span class="ital">sheaf</span>, but considers the <span class="greekheb">φύραμα</span> to be the dough worked up from the harvest-fruit generally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The figure is correctly <span class="ital">interpreted</span>, when by <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀπαρχή</span> we understand the <span class="ital">patriarchs</span> (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), and by <span class="greekheb">τὸ φύρ</span>. <span class="ital">the whole body of the people</span>, to whom the character of holiness—of consecration in property to God—passed over from the former. With the holiness of the <span class="greekheb">πατέρες</span>, <a href="/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;...">Romans 9:4-13</a> (in accordance with which we are not here to think of Abraham <span class="ital">alone</span>), is given also the holiness of the theocratic people, their posterity, according to the divine right of covenant and promise. Comp. <a href="/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;...">Romans 9:4-5</a>. But this holiness, which Paul looks upon, as respects the national whole, in the light of a <span class="ital">character indelebilis</span>, is not the inner moral, but (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) the theocratic legal holiness (“quod juribus ecclesiae et promissis Dei frui possint,” Calovius). The expression is taken of the patriarchs by Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Estius, Grotius, Calovius, Bengel, and others, including Koppe, Tholuck, Köllner, Olshausen, Fritzsche, Philippi, Maier, de Wette, Krehl, Umbreit, Ewald, Reithmayr, Hofmann (though the latter thinks only of <span class="ital">Abraham</span>). This is correct, because the second figure (<span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ ῥίζα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) is capable of no other interpretation (see below); but to explain the two figures differently, as Toletus and Stolz, Reiche and Rückert, Glöckler, Stengel, Bisping, van Hengel, after Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret, have in manifold ways arbitrarily done, is simply a violation of the parallelism. This holds also against the interpretation of the <span class="ital">Jews who have become believing</span>, and of the remaining <span class="ital">mass of the people</span> (Ambrosiaster, Pelagius, Anselm, Toletus, Rosenmüller, Stolz, Reiche, Rückert, Bisping).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ῥίζα</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἱ κλάδοι</span> are the <span class="ital">patriarchs</span> and their theocratic bodily descendants, the <span class="ital">Jews</span>. As the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span> is related to the <span class="greekheb">φύραμα</span>, so is the <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα</span> to the <span class="greekheb">κλάδοι</span>; comp. on the latter, Menander, 711: <span class="greekheb">ἄκαρπός ἐστιν οὗτος ἀπὸ ῥίζης κλάδος</span>. The divergent interpretation, which may deserve to be considered in opposition to this usual one, is, that the <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα</span> is the <span class="ital">first primitive or mother church</span> consisting of the believing Jews, and that the <span class="greekheb">κλάδοι</span> are <span class="ital">the Jews</span>, in so far as they in virtue of their national position were primarily called thereto. This exposition (substantially in Cornelius a Lapide, Carpzov, Schoettgen; Semler and Ammon suppose <span class="greekheb">οἱ κλάδοι</span> to be the Gentile Christians) is still considered possible by de Wette. It is, however, unsuitable; for the (natural) <span class="greekheb">κλάδοι</span> must have <span class="ital">proceeded</span> from the <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα</span>, must have their origin from it (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-25.htm" title="Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.">Sir 23:25</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/40-15.htm" title="The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches: but are as unclean roots upon a hard rock.">Sir 40:15</a>), and the <span class="ital">broken-off branches</span> (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>) must have earlier belonged to the <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα</span>,—which is not the case, if <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα</span> is the Christian mother-church of which they were never <span class="greekheb">κλάδοι</span>. The true theocracy (the olive tree, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-7.htm" title="They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.">Hosea 14:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm" title="Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on the left side thereof?">Zechariah 4:11</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm" title="And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.">Nehemiah 8:15</a>) did not begin in the Christian mother-church (as its root), but in the patriarchs, and Christ Himself was <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> from this sacred root, <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm" title="The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.">Matthew 1:1</a> f. In this view it is clear that the unbelieving Jews, in so far as they rejected Christ, ceased thereby to belong to the true people of God, and fell away from their root. They were now—after the light, and with it judgment, had come into the world (<a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>)—broken-off branches, <span class="ital">apostate</span> children of Abraham (<a href="/john/8-37.htm" title="I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.">John 8:37</a>; <a href="/context/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham....">John 8:39-40</a>), children of the kingdom who were to be cast out (<a href="/matthew/8-12.htm" title="But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 8:12</a>). Comp. the figure of the vine in John 15. See also <a href="/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:">Romans 9:6</a> ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] Lit., and much better, <span class="bld">But</span>, or <span class="bld">Now</span>. The word marks transition to a new fact in connexion with the “receiving” of Israel; the fact of the peculiar position of Jews with regard to the Divine Promise. The main effect of the following passage, to <a href="/romans/11-24.htm" title="For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?">Romans 11:24</a>, is to prove that the restoration of Jews to the Church of Messiah, so far from being unlikely, is in the nature of the case likely. Their peculiar connexion, by lineal descent, with the Fathers, makes it certain that their <span class="ital">return</span> will be as abundantly welcome to their God as the <span class="ital">admission</span> of the Gentiles. We might say <span class="ital">more</span> welcome, but for the fact that <span class="ital">no</span> welcome can be fuller than that which awaits the true believer of whatever nation. But St Paul wishes to meet the rising prejudice (so strong and stubborn in after ages) of Gentile against Jewish believers, by emphasizing the grand fact that the whole Church springs, so to speak, from a Jewish root; and that thus nothing could be, in a certain sense, more <span class="ital">natural</span> than the restoration of Jews to the Church. He has also to announce that there is reserved for Israel, in the future, not merely restoration to the Church, but a work of special importance and glory in it for the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the firstfruit</span>] The Jewish Patriarchs, but perhaps specially Abraham, who was eminently “holy” in the sense of <span class="ital">consecration to the purposes of God</span>.—For the figure here cp. <a href="/numbers/15-21.htm" title="Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an heave offering in your generations.">Numbers 15:21</a>; “Of the first of your dough ye shall offer unto the Lord an heave-offering.” The words just below here point to the idea of “firstfruits” not of <span class="ital">grain</span> but of <span class="ital">bread</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">holy</span>] In the sense indicated in the last note. The Patriarchs were, by the Divine purpose, <span class="ital">separated</span> to be special recipients of Divine light, in trust for their descendants and the world. In a sense somewhat similar their descendants, viewed as a nation, are still <span class="ital">separated</span> in the Divine purpose to a special work connected with Divine mercy. The reference is not, of course, to a supposed superior personal sanctity of individual Jews as such, (which would be to contradict the whole reasoning of cch. 2, 3, 4,) but to the special purpose towards Israel as a nation, in view of which they are reserved (scattered but never vanishing) for a time of grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the root</span>] Here again the figure points to the Patriarchs, and especially to Abraham. (Cp. <a href="/context/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig....">Isaiah 51:1-2</a>, for yet another figure, that of the Quarry, with the same reference.) The “root” and “branches” are here brought in to form the main illustration of the passage following as far as <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>.

The holiness by call and destination of the nation as represented by its fathers (first-fruits, root) implies their future restoration, the holiness of the lump and branches. </body></html>
