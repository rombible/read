Well; take this thought at least along with thee, <span class="ital">Because of unbelief they were broken off </span>— It was not undeservedly, by an act of absolute sovereignty and prerogative, but because of unbelief: by which it appears, it is possible for whole churches, as well as individuals, that have long stood by faith, to fall into such a state of infidelity as may prove their ruin. Now thou art liable to the same infirmity and corruption that they fell by. For <span class="ital">thou standest </span>— Hast a place in God’s favour and family; <span class="ital">by faith</span> — A grace which, in the very nature of it, implies dependance on God, and is itself the free, undeserved gift of God.

Therefore <span class="ital">be not high-minded, but fear </span>— Be not too confident of thy own strength.

Take heed, therefore, lest thy unbelief and barrenness expose thee, who art not a natural branch, but a scion from a foreign stock, to the punishment of excision, after all the great obligations which he hath laid thee under by his unparalleled goodness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:11-21 The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou wilt say then - Thou who art a Gentile.<p>The branches were broken off ... - The Jews were rejected in order that the gospel might be preached to the Gentiles. This would seem to follow from what the apostle had said in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12</a>. Perhaps it might be said that there was some ground of exultation from the fact that God had rejected his ancient people for the sake of making a way open to admit the Gentiles to the church. The objection is, that the branches were broken off in order that others might be grafted in. To this Paul replies in the next verse, that this was not the reason why they were rejected, but their unbelief was the cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-21.

Here he brings in the Gentiles, alleging a reason for their insulting over the Jews; because the Jews were broken off, that they might give place, or make way, for them; and the less worthy do always give place to the more worthy. To this he answers, first, by way of concession: Well, (saith he), it is true, and I do not deny it, that the Jews <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">were broken off, </span> that the Gentiles <span class="ital">might be grafted in.</span> But then he further adds, by way of correction or negation, that the worthiness of the Gentiles was not the cause why the Jews were broken off; but it was <span class="ital">because of</span> their own <span class="ital">unbelief; </span> they would not accept of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a></span>; they went <span class="ital">about to establish their own righteousness, </span> and would <span class="ital">not submit themselves to the righteousness of God, </span> as it is in <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a></span>. Therefore, if you Gentiles shall reason after this manner, you plainly put a fallacy upon yourselves, and take that for a cause which is none: you do not distinguish between the cause and the event; it fell out, indeed, that the Jews, being cast off, the Gentiles were received in, but this was not the cause of that. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And thou standest by faith:</span> q.d. Neither is thy worthiness the cause of thy present standing in the room of the Jews, or of having thy station in the church of Christ; but it is thy believing in that Christ whom the Jews rejected.

This is an objection which the apostle foresaw the Gentiles would make against what he had said, and in favour of their boasting; <p>the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. The sense of which is, that the Jews were rejected and left out of the Gospel church, on purpose to make way for the Gentiles, that they might be put in their room; and consequently the Jews must be more vile and unworthy, and the Gentiles more deserving of such favours and privileges, or God would never have taken such a step, to leave out one to make room for the other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/11-19.htm" title="You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.">Romans 11:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] <span class="ital">therefore;</span> since <span class="ital">this</span> reason (<span class="greekheb">οὐ σὺ τὴν ῥίζαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) forbids thee <span class="greekheb">κατακαυχᾶσθαι</span>, thou wilt have something else to allege.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξεκλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">branches were broken off</span> (see critical notes), <span class="ital">in order that I</span>, etc. This <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐγώ</span> has the stress of arrogant self-esteem, which, however, is not to be extended also to <span class="greekheb">κλάδοι</span> forming the simple subject, and not even standing in the first place (Hofmann: “<span class="ital">branches which were so</span> are broken off”).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/11-19.htm" title="You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.">Romans 11:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐρεῖς οὖν</span>: the presumptuous Gentile persists. “It is not to the root I compare myself, but branches were broken off that I might be engrafted: that surely involves some superiority in me.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">then</span>] <span class="bld">therefore</span>; i.e. in order to meet my reasoning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/11-19.htm" title="You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.">Romans 11:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">in order that</span>) This particle expresses the chief force of the <span class="ital">boasting</span> [of the Gentiles]; but in opposition to this <span class="ital">boasting</span> compare the, <span class="ital">for your sakes</span>, <a href="/romans/11-28.htm" title="As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.">Romans 11:28</a>, and <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span>, <a href="/romans/11-31.htm" title="Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.">Romans 11:31</a> [sc. <span class="greekheb">ὑμετέρῳ ἐλέει</span>, they disobeyed to the end that through <span class="ital">the</span> mercy showed <span class="ital">to you they</span> might obtain mercy.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in</span>.
