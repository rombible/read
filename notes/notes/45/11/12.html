The Apostle seems to have in view not only the supersession of the Jews by the Gentiles, but also, under the figure of a defeat in battle, the reduction of their numbers to a small remnant. And, on the other hand, he looks forward to their full and complete restoration, when every Jew shall be a member of the Messianic kingdom, and there shall not be one missing. The full “complement,” as it were, of the nation is what is meant by “fulness;” its temporary reduction and degradation is expressed by “diminishing.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:11-21 The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the fall of them - If their lapse, or falling. If their temporal rejection and being cast off for a time has already accomplished so much.<p>Be the riches of the world - The word "riches" means wealth, abundance of property; more than is necessary to the supply of our needs. Hence, it means also anything that may promote our comfort or happiness, as wealth is the means of securing our welfare. The gospel is called riches, as it is the means of our highest enjoyment, and eternal welfare. It is the means of conferring numberless spiritual blessings on the Gentile world; and as this was done by the fall of the Jews, so it could be said that their fall was the riches of the world. It was the occasion or means without which the blessings of the gospel could not be conferred on the world.<p>The diminishing of them - Margin, "Decay." "Loss" &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  he&#772;tte&#772;ma. This word means diminution, defect, what is lacked or missing. Hence, also judgment, condemnation. Here it means their degradation; the withdrawing of their special privileges; their rejection. It stands opposed to "their fulness."<p>The riches of the Gentiles - The means of conferring important blessings on the Gentiles.<p>How much more their fulness - The word "fulness" &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  ple&#772;ro&#772;ma means what fills up, or completes anything. Thus, it is applied to what fills a vessel or cup; also to the piece of cloth which is put in to fill up the rent in a garment; <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a>. To the fragments which were left when Christ had fed the five thousand; <a href="/mark/8-20.htm">Mark 8:20</a>; <a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>. "Love is the fulfilling of the law," that is, it is the filling up of the law, or what renders the obedience complete; see <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a>. Here it stands opposed to their fall, and their diminution, and evidently means their complete restoration to the favor of God; their recovery from unbelief and apostasy. That there will be such a recovery, the apostle proceeds to show. The sentiment of the passage then is, If their rejection and punishment; their being cut off from the favor of God, an event apparently so unlikely to promote the spread of true religion, if their being withrawn from all active influence in spreading the true knowledge of God, be yet the occasion of so many blessings to mankind as have attended the spread of the gospel in consequence of it; how much more shall we expect when they shall be restored; when the energy and zeal of the Jewish nation shall unite with the efforts of others in spreading the knowledge of the true Messiah. In what way, or when, this shall be, we know not. But it is easy to see, that if the Jewish people should be converted to the Christian faith, they would have facilities for spreading the truth, which the church has never had without them.<p>(1) they are scattered in all nations, and have access to all people.<p>(2) their conversion, after so long unbelief, would have all the power and influence of a miracle performed in view of all nations. It would be seen why they had been preserved, and their conversion would be a most striking fulfillment of the prophecies.<p>(3) they are familiar with the languages of the world, and their conversion would at once establish many Christian missionaries in the heart of all the kingdoms of the world. It would be kindling at once a thousand lights in all the dark parts of the earth.<p>(4) the Jews have shown that they are eminently suited to spread the true religion. It was by Jews converted to Christianity, that the gospel was first spread. Each of the apostles was a Jew; and they have lost none of the ardor, enterprise, and zeal that always characterized their nation. Their conversion would be, therefore, to give to the church a host of missionaries prepared for their work, familiar with all customs, languages, and climes, and already in the heart of all kingdoms, and with facilities for their work in advance, which others must gain only by the slow toil of many years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The apostle having showed, that the falling away of the Jews was an occasion of the coming in of the Gentiles, it might be objected, that the conversion of the Jews might likewise be an occasion of the falling away of the Gentiles. To this he answers negatively, and confirms his answer by an argument from the less to the greater; that if their fall and diminution were the riches of the Gentiles, their calling again would be so much more: q.d. If God hath made use of the fall and rejection of the Jews, for an occasion of pouring out the riches or abundance of his grace upon the nations; and if the number of believing Jews, being so very small, (which is meant by their <span class="ital">diminishing</span>), hath occasioned the conversion of such a multitude of Gentiles; then how much more will their fulness have the effect! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">How much more their fulness!</span> i.e. their general conversion, the coming in of the Jews, shall so fill the world with wonder, and the gospel with lustre, that a much further accession will be made even to the number of the believing Gentiles. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world,.... By "the world", as is clear from the next clause, is meant the Gentiles; who were frequently called so by the Jews, who reckoned themselves to be "the church", and all the nations round about them, "the world"; which observation may serve to illustrate other passages of Scripture; see <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; now the fall of the Jews, which was a lessening of them, was the riches of the Gentiles; <p>and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; the number of the true believers in Christ among them were very few, the generality of them received him not, but stumbled at him, and fell through unbelief; but the few that did believe were the means of carrying and spreading the Gospel, which is, "the unsearchable riches of Christ", <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, in the Gentile world: thus at first a persecution being raised against the church at Jerusalem, the ministers of the Gospel were scattered abroad, and went everywhere preaching the word; and afterwards the Jews behaving in a very indecent manner towards the apostles of Christ, they turned in a manner wholly to the Gentiles; and thus by the means of a few, a diminutive company, of which the Apostle Paul was one, the Gospel, the pearl of great price, treasure hid in a field, and put into earthen vessels, was carried into the Heathen world, and by it they were enriched. This handful of men that went out of Judea, were the means of converting vast numbers, large multitudes of souls among the Gentiles, which may be also designed by "riches": this word sometimes signifying plenty, see <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; and also of enriching them with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and of directing them to Christ, who has durable riches, treasures of wisdom and knowledge, riches of grace, and riches of glory. Now the apostle argues, that if such a small number of the Jews who embraced Christ, were of so much advantage to the Gentiles, <p>how much more their fulness? when converts to Christ among them will be as the sand of the sea, a nation of them shall be born again at once, and all Israel be saved. This will be a great accession to the Gentile church, bring much glory to it, contribute greatly to its welfare, and be a means of establishing their faith, and of putting fresh life and vigour into them, and of inspiring them with more zeal for Christ, and for his honour and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now if the fall of them <i>be</i> the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> fulness?</span><p>(k) By riches he means the knowledge of the Gospel to everlasting life: and by the world, all nations dispersed throughout the whole world.<p>(l) Of the Jews, when the whole nation without exception will come to Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] <span class="greekheb">μεταβατικόν</span>, leading over from what has been said in <a href="/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

See Perizon. <span class="ital">ad Ael. V. H</span>. ii. 25. Here the proper signification is to be retained, and that, as the contrast of <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα</span> requires, in a <span class="ital">numerical</span> respect. So now also Tholuck, likewise Mangold. Through the fact that a part of the Jews was unbelieving, the people has <span class="ital">suffered an overthrow</span>, has, like a vanquished army, been weakened in numbers, inasmuch, namely, as the unbelieving portion by its unbelief practically seceded from the people of God. Comp. Vulg.: “<span class="ital">diminutio</span> eorum;” Luthardt: “loss in amount.” If it be explained as: <span class="ital">loss of the Messianic salvation, which they have suffered</span> (Fritzsche and others), or: <span class="ital">the loss which the kingdom of God has suffered in their case</span> (Philippi, comp. Kahnis, <span class="ital">Dogm</span>. I. p. 573), the former is not appropriate to the contrast of <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span>, and the latter introduces the reference to the kingdom of God, as that which has suffered the detriment, the more unwarrantably, inasmuch as the genit. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> is expressed. The <span class="ital">threefold</span> <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> is to be taken with the <span class="ital">like</span> reference as the genitive of the subject, and applies in each instance to the people Israel as a whole (whose collective guilt also is the <span class="greekheb">παράπτωμα</span>), in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span>—which likewise is not preserved in Philippi’s view. This very circumstance, and more decisively the utter absence of linguistic proof, tells also against the traditional usual rendering, according to which <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἥττημα</span> is supposed to signify the <span class="ital">minority:</span> “<span class="ital">paucitas Judaeorum credentium</span>” (Grotius). So, in substance, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Erasmus, Beza, Estius, Wetstein, Bengel, and many others, including Reiche, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Maier, Bisping, Reithmayr; comp. Ewald: “their <span class="ital">remaining behind</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῶν</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλοῦτος ἐθνῶν γενήσεται</span>; <span class="ital">how much more their becoming full</span>, that is, how much more will it issue in the enrichment of the Gentiles with the Messianic salvation, if the Jews, after the defeat which they have suffered, shall again be reinstated to their <span class="ital">plena copia</span>, so that they will then again in their full amount (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm" title="And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:">Romans 11:26</a>), as an integral whole, belong to the people of God,—which will take place through the conversion of all Israel to Christ (not <span class="ital">would</span>, as Luther has it). The <span class="greekheb">ἥττημα αὐτῶν</span> is then compensated, and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> brought in, which, moreover, may take place even with a continuance of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΑΣΠΟΡΆ</span></span></span>. On <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ</span></span></span> generally, see Fritzsche, II. p. 469 ff. Comp. on <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>. The <span class="ital">numerical</span> reference of the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα αὐτῶν</span> is suggested by the correlative <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ ΤῶΝ ἘΘΝῶΝ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; and in so far the view which takes it of the <span class="ital">full number</span> of the Jews (Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">πάντες πιστεύσαντες μειζόνων ἀγαθῶν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐγένοντο ἂν πρόξενοι</span>, so most) is correct. Comp. Ewald: “their <span class="ital">full admission</span>, supplying what is wanting.” With this Umbreit mixes up at the same time “the fulfilment of their predestination;” whilst van Hengel sees in the <span class="greekheb">πλήρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>., not absolutely the full number, but only the collective body of <span class="ital">those destined by God to conversion</span>, which, however, is not expressed, but is supplied by the reader. The various views correspond to the varying explanations of <span class="greekheb">ἥττημα</span>. So <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Fritzsche: the fulness of Messianic salvation, which they will possess; Philippi: the filling up—which takes place through their conversion—of the blank in the kingdom of God which arose through their unbelief; Rückert, Köllner: the restoration of Israel to its befitting position; Hofmann: the status, in which they are fully and entirely that which they ought to be (qualitative). Luthardt also takes the correct view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>.

His paraphrase of this verse is very good. “If the Gentiles have been enriched in a sense through the very miscarriage and disaster of Israel, what wealth is in store for them in the great Return, when all Israel shall be saved—‘when God hath made the pile complete!’ ” The enrichment referred to is in both cases that which comes through participating in the blessings of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">the fall</span>] Same word as in <a href="/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

See note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the riches</span>] “The unsearchable riches of Messiah,” (<a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>,) which “on occasion of” the rejection of Messiah by the Jews were preached to the “world” of the Gentiles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the diminishing</span>] The Gr. word, by analogy with cognate words in the classics, invites the rendering “<span class="ital">defeat</span>.” But it stands here in plain contrast to that rendered “<span class="ital">fulness;</span>” and so should be interpreted a <span class="bld">lessening, falling short</span>, in respect of <span class="ital">numbers</span>. Unbelief in Messiah <span class="ital">reduced</span> to woeful <span class="ital">fewness</span> the “Israel” which was really in covenant.
