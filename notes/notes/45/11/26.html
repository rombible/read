The Apostle appears to be quoting from memory, and is influenced by a reminiscence of other passages. Zion is the centre and capital of the theocracy, but the Messiah must first take up His abode there before He can issue from it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And so - That is, in this manner; or when the great abundance of the Gentiles shall be converted, then all Israel shall be saved.<p>All Israel - All the Jews. It was a maxim among the Jews that "every Israelite should have part in the future age." (Grotius.) The apostle applies that maxim to his own purpose; and declares the sense in which it would be true. He does not mean to say that every Jew of every age would be saved; for he had proved that a large portion of them would be, in his time, rejected and lost. But the time would come when, as a people, they would be recovered; when the nation would turn to God; and when it could be said of them that, as a nation, they were restored to the divine favor. It is not clear that he means that even then every individual of them would be saved, but the body of them; the great mass of the nation would be. Nor is it said when this would be. This is one of the things which "the Father hath put in his own power;" <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>. He has given us the assurance that it shall be done to encourage us in our efforts to save them; and he has concealed the time when it shall be, lest we should relax our efforts, or feel that no exertions were needed to accomplish what must take place at a fixed time.<p>Shall be saved - Shall be recovered from their rejection; be restored to the divine favor; become followers of the Messiah, and thus be saved as all other Christians are.<p>As it is written - <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>. The quotation is not literally made, but the sense of the passage is preserved. The Hebrew is, "There shall come to Zion a Redeemer, and for those who turn from ungodliness in Jacob." There can be no doubt that Isaiah refers here to the times of the gospel.<p>Out of Zion - Zion was one of the bills of Jerusalem. On this was built the city of David. It came thus to denote, in general, the church, or people of God. And when it is said that the Redeemer should come out of Zion, it means that he should arise among that people, be descended from themselves, or should not be a foreigner. The Septuagint, however render it, "the Redeemer shall come on account of Zion." So the Chaldee paraphrase, and the Latin Vulgate.<p>And shall turn away ... - The Hebrew is, "to those forsaking un godliness in Jacob." The Septuagint has rendered it in the same manner as the apostle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27. And so all Israel shall be saved&#8212;To understand this great statement, as some still do, merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews, that there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest violence both to it and to the whole context. It can only mean the ultimate ingathering of Israel as a nation, in contrast with the present "remnant." (So Tholuck, Meyer, De Wette, Philippi, Alford, Hodge). Three confirmations of this now follow: two from the prophets, and a third from the Abrahamic covenant itself. First, as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and<p>shall&#8212;or, according to what seems the true reading, without the "and"&#8212;"He shall"<p>turn away ungodliness from Jacob&#8212;The apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's sinfulness chiefly from Ps 14:1-7 and Isa 59:1-21, now seems to combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's salvation from it [Bengel]. In the one place the Psalmist longs to see the "salvation of Israel coming out of Zion" (Ps 14:7); in the other, the prophet announces that "the Redeemer (or, 'Deliverer') shall come to (or 'for') Zion" (Isa 59:20). But as all the glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as issuing out of Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory (Ps 20:2; 110:2; Isa 31:9), the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them that familiar idea. And whereas the prophet announces that He "shall come to (or, 'for') them that turn from transgression in Jacob," while the apostle makes Him say that He shall come "to turn away ungodliness from Jacob," this is taken from the Septuagint version, and seems to indicate a different reading of the original text. The sense, however, is substantially the same in both. Second,<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is a third and chief part of the aforementioned <span class="ital">mystery, </span> that in the end, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all Israel shall be saved.</span> By <span class="ital">Israel</span> is not meant the whole church of God, consisting of Jews and Gentiles; so that word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a></span>, and elsewhere; for then, what he spake would have been no mystery at all: but by <span class="ital">Israel</span> here (as in the precedent verse) you must understand, the nation and people of the Jews. And by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all Israel</span> is not meant every individual Israelite, but many, or (it may be) the greatest part of them. So <span class="ital">all</span> is to be taken in Scripture: see <span class="bld"><a href="/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a> <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1 Timothy 2:6</a></span>, and elsewhere. Look, as when he speaks of the conversion of the Gentiles, and the coming in of their fulness, there are many (too many of them) still unconverted; so, notwithstanding the general calling of the Jews, a great many of them may remain uncalled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As it is written; </span> the apostle had this by revelation, but he proves it also by Scripture. All are not agreed from whence these testimonies are taken; the former is found (with some little variation) in <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a></span>: as for the latter, some think it is taken from <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a></span>. Others think, that he joineth two places in Isaiah together, (as he did before, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a></span>), and the last words are taken out of <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a></span>. The Seventy have the very words used by the apostle. These prophecies and promises, though they were in part fulfilled when Christ came in the flesh, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/3-26.htm" title="To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.">Acts 3:26</a></span>}</span> yet there will be a more full and complete accomplishment thereof upon the Jewish nation and people towards the end of the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And so all Israel shall be saved,.... Meaning not the mystical spiritual Israel of God, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, who shall appear to be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation, when all God's elect among the latter are gathered in, which is the sense many give into; but the people of the Jews, the generality of them, the body of that nation, called "the fulness" of them, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>, and relates to the latter day, when a nation of them shall be born again at once; when, their number being as the sand of the sea, they shall come up out of the lands where they are dispersed, and appoint them one head, Christ, and great shall be the day of Jezreel; when they as a body, even the far greater part of them that shall be in being, shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King; shall acknowledge Jesus to be the true Messiah, and shall look to him, believe on him, and be saved by him from wrath to come. There is a common saying among them (c),      , "all Israel shall have a part", or "portion in the world to come"; and in support of this they usually produce the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, "thy people also shall be all righteous": yea, they even go so far as to say (d), <p>"that hell fire will have no power over the transgressors of Israel;'' <p>fancying, that every individual person of their nation will be saved; though they sometimes except such who deny the resurrection of the dead, and that the law is from heaven, or is an epicure, and he that reads foreign books, or is an enchanter, or pronounces the ineffable name: but the apostle is not to be understood with such a latitude; he refers to the last times, and to a very general conversion of them to the Messiah: <p>as it is written, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>, <p>there shall come out of Zion the Deliverer: the words of the prophet are, "and the Redeemer shall come to Zion": by the Redeemer, or Deliverer, words of the same signification, is meant the Messiah, as the Jews (e) themselves own, and apply this passage to him; who is the "Goel", or near kinsman of his people, to whom the right of their redemption belongs as man; and who as God was able to effect it, and, as God-man and Mediator, was every way qualified for it, and has obtained it for them: and whereas, in the prophet Isaiah, he is said to "come to", and by the apostle, "out of Zion", this may be reconciled by observing, that the servile letter sometimes signifies "from", as well as to, when it is put in the room of  of which instances may be given, as <a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a> compared with  <a href="/2_chronicles/11-4.htm">2 Chronicles 11:4</a>. Besides, the Messiah was to come out of Zion, as well as to come to it, according to <a href="/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>; so that the apostle fitly expresses the faith and expectation of the old Jewish church in this citation: <p>and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob; in the prophet it is, "and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob", <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>. The apostle follows the translation of the Septuagint, and which is favoured by the Chaldee paraphrase, which runs thus; "the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to turn the rebellious ones of the house of Jacob to the law"; so that the Jew (f) has no reason to charge the apostle with a perversion of the prophet's words, when they are cited so agreeably to their own Targumist: and the sense of them relates not to what Christ did on the cross, when the iniquities of his people were laid on him, and he bore them, and removed them all in one day from them; but to what he will do to the Jews in the latter day, in consequence thereof; he will convince them of their ungodliness, give them repentance for it and remission of it. <p>(c) Misn.

Nor was this deviation <span class="ital">more convenient</span> (Hofmann) for the apostle, namely, in order to designate Christ’s place of manifestation; but it involuntarily on his part found its way into the citation freely handled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ῥυόμενος</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> not <span class="ital">God</span> (Grotius, van Hengel), who first emerges in <a href="/romans/11-27.htm" title="For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.">Romans 11:27</a>, but the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>. In the Heb. we find <span class="greekheb">גּוֹאֵל</span>, a deliverer, <span class="ital">without</span> the article, by which, however, no other is intended. The <span class="ital">future coming</span> of the deliverer which is here predicted is, in the sense of the fulfilment of this prophecy, necessarily that whereby the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Πᾶς ἸΣΡΑῊΛ ΣΩΘΉΣΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span> will be effected; consequently not the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>, because the conversion of all Israel must be antecedent to this, but rather that specially efficacious <span class="ital">self-revelation of Christ in the preaching of His gospel</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>), to be expected by the future, whereby He will bring about that final sacred-historical epoch of the people, the conversion of its totality. Erroneously, however, Augustine, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Beda have supposed it predicted that Elijah or Enoch would appear before the end of the world as converter of the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΤΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΣΕΒ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΠῸ ἸΑΚ</span></span></span>.] <span class="ital">He will turn away, i.e.</span> (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/baruch/3-7.htm" title="And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee.">Bar 3:7</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-58.htm" title="Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away.">1Ma 4:58</a>) remove, do away with <span class="ital">impieties from Jacob</span>.

Hence there follows, as the correlative to this in <a href="/romans/11-27.htm" title="For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.">Romans 11:27</a>, the <span class="ital">forgiveness of sins</span> on the part of <span class="ital">God</span>, procured through Him, and that as the actually saving essence of the <span class="ital">covenant</span>, which the people possesses from God.

Paul, however, because following generally in this quotation the LXX., retains also its deviation from the original text, but not as if this could have been more welcome to him for his object, for in that respect he might have just as well made use of the words of the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὕτη</span>] points to the <span class="ital">following</span> (comp. <a href="/1_john/5-2.htm" title="By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.">1 John 5:2</a>), so that the sense of <a href="/romans/11-27.htm" title="For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.">Romans 11:27</a> is: “<span class="ital">And when I shall have forgiven their sins, this</span>, this remission of sins conferred by me, <span class="ital">will be my covenant to them, i.e.</span> they will therein have from me the execution of my covenant.” Both in the original and in the LXX. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὝΤΗ</span></span></span> points to the following, in which the words of the covenant (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΠΝΕῦΜΑ ΤῸ ἘΜῸΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Οὐ ΜῊ ἘΚΛΊΠῌ ἘΚ ΤΟῦ ΣΤΌΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) are adduced; but instead of them, Paul, for the object which he has in view, puts <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ ἈΦΈΛΩΜΑΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> from <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>, where likewise a preceding demonstrative (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦΤΌ ἘΣΤΙΝ Ἡ ΕὐΛΟΓΊΑ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>) points forward to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ</span></span></span>. Hence we may not, with others (including Köllner and Hofmann), refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὝΤΗ</span></span></span> to the <span class="ital">preceding</span>, in which case <span class="greekheb">ἀποστρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀσεβείας ἀπὸ Ἰακ</span>. is supposed to point to the <span class="ital">moral conversion</span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΕΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἉΜΑΡΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤ</span></span></span>. to the <span class="ital">forgiveness</span>, on the ground of which that conversion takes place (see Hofmann). According to this view, the essence of the covenant would lie in <span class="ital">sanctification</span>, not in <span class="ital">reconciliation</span>, which would be conceived rather as <span class="ital">antecedent</span> to the covenant,—a view which runs counter to the N.

Euseb. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> iii. 35; <span class="ital">Judaizantes</span> in Jerome; Grotius, Limborch, Wetstein), is set aside, notwithstanding <a href="/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:">Acts 21:20</a>, by the literal meaning of <span class="greekheb">πᾶς Ἰσραήλ</span> and of <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα τῶν ἐθνῶν</span>. The fulfilment is to be regarded <span class="ital">as still future, as the last step in the universal extension of Christianity upon earth</span>. In respect of <span class="ital">time</span> no more special definition can be given, than that the conversion of the totality of the Gentiles must precede it; whence only this is certain, that it is <span class="ital">still a time very distant</span>. Paul has certainly viewed the matter as <span class="ital">near</span>, seeing that he conceived the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> itself to be near (not merely, perhaps, its <span class="ital">possible</span>, but its <span class="ital">actual</span> emergence—in opposition to Philippi),—a conception which was shared by him with the whole apostolical church, although it remained without the verification of the event, as this was conceived of. But the promise of the conversion of the people of Israel is not on that account itself to be regarded as one, the fulfilment of which is no longer to be hoped for,—as though, with the non-verified conception of the <span class="ital">time</span> of the event, the <span class="ital">event itself</span> should fall to the ground (Ammon, Reiche, Köllner, Fritzsche); for it is the fact in itself, and not the epoch of it, which is disclosed by the apostle as part of the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> which was revealed to him; and therefore this disclosure rested on the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span> received, not on individual opinion and expectation. The <span class="ital">duration of time</span> until the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> was not subject-matter of revelation, <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>, and the conception of it belongs, therefore, not to that in the apostolic teaching which has the guarantee of divine certainty, but to the domain of subjective hope and expectation, which associated themselves with what was revealed,—a distinction which even Philippi does not reject. The latter, however, endeavours to remove from the category of error the apostolic expectation of the nearness of the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>, because it was not cherished with that divine certainty; but cannot thereby prevent it, where it is presupposed so definitely, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.">Romans 13:11</a>, or is expressed so unconditionally, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, from being characterized by an unprejudiced mind as a <span class="ital">human</span> error, which did not, however, exclude occasionally other moods, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>, <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a>. Of such human mistakes and vacillations, which lie outside the range of revealed truth, that truth is independent (against Hoelemann, <span class="ital">neue Bibelstud</span>. p. 232 ff., and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may further notice that our passage directly controverts the Ebionitish view, now renewed in various quarters (Chr. A. Crusius, Delitzsch, Baumgarten, Ebrard, Auberlen, and others; expositors of the Apocalypse), of an actual restoration of Israel to the theocratic kingdom in Canaan, as to be expected on the ground of prophetic predictions (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm" title="Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a> ff., <a href="/context/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:...">Hosea 3:4-5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm" title="From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous.

This is an independent sentence. For <span class="greekheb">πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ</span> see <a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm" title="And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.">1 Kings 12:1</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>. It means Israel as a whole. Paul is thinking of the historical people, as the contrast with Gentiles shows, but he is not thinking of them one by one. Israel a Christian nation, Israel as a nation a part of the Messianic kingdom, is the content of his thought. To make <span class="greekheb">πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ</span> refer to a “spiritual” Israel, or to the elect, is to miss the mark: it foretells a “conversion of the Jews so universal that the separation into an ‘<span class="ital">elect remnant</span>’ and ‘<span class="ital">the rest who were hardened</span>’ shall disappear” (Gifford). <span class="greekheb">καθὼς γέγραπται</span> <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a> f., but the last words <span class="greekheb">ὅταν ἀφέλωμαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. from <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>. The prophet says <span class="greekheb">ἕνεκεν Σίων</span> Paul’s <span class="greekheb">ἐκ Σιὼν</span> is probably a lapse of memory, due to the impression of passages like Ps. 14:7, 53:7, <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>, though Philippi thinks it intentional—the object being to emphasise the title of the Jews, as against the Gentiles, to a share in the kingdom. It is then as if he said: Salvation is <span class="ital">of</span> the Jews, and surely therefore <span class="ital">for</span> them. It is impossible to say that <span class="greekheb">ἥξει</span> refers to the first or to the second advent: the distinction is not present to Paul’s mind as he writes; all he is concerned with is the fact that in prophetic scripture language is used which implies that Israel as a people is to inherit the Messianic salvation. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ῥυόμενος</span>, Hebrew <span class="greekheb">גֹּאֵל</span> is the Messiah. <span class="greekheb">ἀποστρέψει ἀσεβείας</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/baruch/3-7.htm" title="And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee.">Bar 3:7</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-58.htm" title="Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away.">1Ma 4:58</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">And so all Israel shall be saved</span>] Several interpretations of these words are in themselves legitimate. They may refer (A) to the natural Israel, the Jews; or (B) to the “Israel of God,” the true Church of Christ. Again, if the reference (A) is adopted, the prophecy may mean (<span class="ital">a</span>) that then <span class="ital">all</span> the <span class="ital">elect of Israel</span> shall at length be gathered in—the long process shall at length be complete; or (<span class="ital">b</span>) that every individual of the then generation of Jews shall be brought to Messiah’s grace; or (<span class="ital">c</span>) that “all” bears a less exact reference here, as so often in Scripture, and means “in general;”—“Israel in general, the Jews of that day as a great aggregate, on a scale unknown before, shall be saved.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of these various possibilities we prefer on the whole (A. <span class="ital">c</span>,) as the most in accord with the context, and with the analogy of Scripture. The explanation (B) is <span class="ital">in itself</span> entirely true: the final glory and triumph of the Gospel will surely be, not specially the salvation of the Jews, but that of the Universal Church—the immortal Bride of the King Eternal. And it is extremely important to remember the full recognition in Scripture of <span class="ital">all</span> its true members as the “<span class="ital">seed of Abraham</span>” (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>). But this is not the truth exactly in point here, where St Paul is dealing with the special prospect of a time when “blindness in part” will no longer characterize <span class="ital">Jews as Jews</span>. And the “Israel” of <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a> is probably the Israel of <a href="/romans/11-26.htm" title="And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:">Romans 11:26</a>, as no distinction is suggested in the interval.—Again, the reference marked (A. <span class="ital">a</span>), though perfectly true <span class="ital">in itself</span>, is less likely here because in <a href="/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>; <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>, we have had already a prediction of a restoration of Jews, <span class="ital">en masse</span>, to grace; whereas the process of gathering in the elect of all ages is continuous, and thus, on the whole, gradual.—Again, the reference marked (A. <span class="ital">b</span>), though the Divine Plan <span class="ital">may</span>, of course, intend no less, is far from analogous to the main teaching of Scripture as to the developements (even the largest) of grace in this world.—On the whole, then, we adopt the interpretation which explains the sentence as predicting the conversion of some generation or generations of Jews, a conversion so real and so vastly extensive that unbelief shall be the small exception at the most, and that Jews as such shall everywhere be recognized as true Christians, lights in the world, and salt on the earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There shall come out of Sion</span>, &c.] In the following quotation St Paul more or less combines, as often, (see e.g. <a href="/context/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:...">Romans 3:10-18</a>,) several O. T. prophecies; with this for the main purport, that one ultimate result of the coming of Messiah should be the gift of grace to the Jews. In <a href="/context/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD....">Isaiah 59:20-21</a>, we have in the Heb., “And there shall come a Redeemer for Zion, and for them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord: As for me, this is my covenant with them.” In <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>; “This is all the fruit [of God’s dealings, namely] to take away his [Jacob’s] sin.” In <a href="/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a> (LXX. <a href="/romans/13-7.htm" title="Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.">Romans 13:7</a>); “Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!” In <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a> the LXX. has, “There shall come for Sion’s sake the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.” In <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a> it has, “This is his blessing, when I shall take away his sin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul seems to have woven into one <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a> and <a href="/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a>, and to have completed the sentence from <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>. In the last clause of <a href="/romans/11-26.htm" title="And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:">Romans 11:26</a> here he adopts the LXX., because, though it represents the Heb. inexactly, the substantial meaning is untouched:—the Redeemer’s coming shall be “for,” “for the benefit of,” those who turn from sin, by <span class="ital">being the cause of their so doing;</span> He shall thus <span class="ital">turn sin from them</span>, in the sense of removing its guilt and breaking its power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall come out of Sion</span>] Here probably the reference is to the First Advent. Q. d., “It stands foretold that the Appearance of Messiah, of the seed of David, shall result in the subdual of the unbelief and rebellion of Jacob, and the bringing in of a covenant for him of final pardon and peace. Now Messiah <span class="ital">has</span> appeared; therefore, how slow soever the fulfilment be as yet, the remainder of this great promise must be drawing on: Israel shall yet be saved.” The words have been often explained to foretel a <span class="ital">future</span> Coming of the Redeemer, whether literal or figurative, to work the conversion of Israel on a great scale. But the explanation above is fully sufficient for the argument, and (to say the least) more in accord with St Paul’s general teaching as to the future Coming of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Deliverer</span>] <span class="bld">the Rescuer</span>; same word as <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, “who rescueth us from the wrath to come.” Heb. “<span class="ital">Goel;</span>” the Avenger of a Kinsman; hence generally the strong friend who rescues the weak.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ungodliness</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">impieties</span>.—Perhaps omit the “and” before “shall turn away.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/11-26.htm" title="And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:">Romans 11:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὓτω</span>, <span class="ital">and so</span>) he does not say <span class="ital">and then</span>, but with greater force, <span class="ital">and so</span>, in which very expression the <span class="ital">then</span> is included; to wit, the blindness of Israel will be terminated by the very coming in of the Gentiles.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ</span>, <span class="ital">all Israel</span>) Israel contradistinguished from the Gentiles, of which <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a> treats.
