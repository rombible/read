For “behold,” a decisive consensus of the best MSS. has “but if.” The corruption was very obvious and easy. Adopting “but if,” the answering clause of the sentence is to be found in the question, “Teachest thou not thyself?” <a href="/romans/2-21.htm" title="You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?">Romans 2:21</a>. The connecting particle “therefore” at the beginning of the same verse is merely resumptive, or, as it is technically called, “epanaleptic.”<p>Turning to the Jew, the Apostle breaks out into indignant and vehement apostrophe, “If you have the name of Jew, and repose upon the Law, and make your boast in God, and do all these other things—why then, while you profess to teach others, do you not teach yourself?” A fine specimen of the natural eloquence which the Apostle derives from intense feeling. The different features of the picture crowd into his mind to point the contrast between what the Jew claimed to be and what he was.<p><span class= "bld">Restest in.</span>—Reposest or reliest upon a law.

And here therefore he refutes the highest point of Jewish glorying, after a further description of it, interposed <a href="/context/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,...">Romans 2:17-20</a>, and refuted <a href="/context/romans/2-21.htm" title="You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?...">Romans 2:21-24</a>. The description consists of twice five articles; of which the former five, <a href="/context/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,...">Romans 2:17-18</a>, show what he boasts of in himself; the other five, (<a href="/context/romans/2-19.htm" title="And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,...">Romans 2:19-20</a>,) what he glories in with respect to others. The first particular of the former five answers to the first of the latter; the second to the second, and so on. <span class="ital">Thou art called a Jew </span>— A professor of the true religion, and a worshipper of the true God. Dr. Macknight is of opinion that in this and the following verses, the apostle intended to address chiefly the men of rank and learning among the Jews; a supposition to which he thinks it is no objection that probably there were no doctors of the law, nor Jewish scribes and priests at Rome, when this letter was written; because, “as the apostle was reasoning against the whole body of the nation, his argument required that he should address the teachers of every denomination, to whom the things written in this and the following verses best agree. Besides, as he had addressed the heathen legislators, philosophers, and priests, in the first chapter, for the purpose of showing them the bad use they had made of the knowledge they derived from the works of creation, it was natural for him in this to address the Jewish scribes, priests, and doctors, to show them how little they had profited by the knowledge which they had derived from revelation. Of the Jewish common people the apostle speaks, <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>, &c., where he proves that they also were extremely vicious.” <span class="ital">And restest in the law </span>— Dependest on it alone, and on the having of it, for justification and salvation, though it can only condemn thee. <span class="ital">And makest thy boast of God</span> — As thy God; as belonging only to you Jews, and being yours in a peculiar manner; the founder of your commonwealth; your lawgiver, protector, and Saviour. <span class="ital">And knowest his will </span>— By special revelation, and more fully than the Gentiles. <span class="ital">And approvest the things that are more excellent — </span>Hast attained to a considerable degree of understanding in the law, so as to place a proper value upon things according to their worth, and to distinguish between things lawful and unlawful. The original words, <span class="greekheb">δοκιμαζεις τα διαφεροντα</span>, may be rendered, <span class="ital">and triest, </span>or, <span class="ital">approvest on trial, the things that differ. Being instructed, </span>&c. — Or, as Beza interprets <span class="greekheb">κατηχουμενος εκ τον νομου</span>, <span class="ital">Being educated, </span>or <span class="ital">instructed from thy childhood, out of the law, </span><a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 3:15</a>. <span class="ital">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind </span>— Vainly presumest that thou hast knowledge enough to teach others. The Jewish doctors, in contempt of the Gentiles, were wont to speak of them as <span class="ital">blind — in darkness — ignorant — babes </span>— and boasted of themselves as guides, to whose direction the Gentiles, in matters of religion, ought implicitly to submit. This boasting of the Jews the apostle introduced here, to show that their sins were greatly aggravated by the revelation of which they boasted. <span class="ital">Who hast the form of knowledge </span>— A system, body, or model of that knowledge, which is scattered up and down in the law, and of the truths which are there delivered. For the original word, <span class="greekheb">μορφωσις</span>, seems to bear this meaning: and the apostle may be considered as comparing the law to a looking-glass, which exhibits exact images of things, as the Apostle James likewise does, <a href="/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">James 1:25</a>. This implies that they not only considered themselves as having a sketch, or the outlines, of the truth contained in the law, but the most accurate knowledge of it. And this they counted sufficient to save them, though they lived in a loose and ungodly manner.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:17-24 The apostle directs his discourse to the Jews, and shows of what sins they were guilty, notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the root and sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride. A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God and religion, by their not living according to their profession. Many despise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form of godliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void of life and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy lives dishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold - Having thus stated the general principles on which God would judge the world; having shown how they condemned the Gentiles; and having removed all objections to them, he now proceeds to another part of his argument, to show how they applied to the Jews. By the use of the word "behold," he calls their attention to it, as to an important subject; and with great skill and address, he states their privileges, before he shows them how those privileges might enhance their condemnation. He admits all their claims to pre-eminence in privileges, and then with great faithfulness proceeds to show how, if abused, these might deepen their final destruction. It should be observed, however, that the word rendered "behold" is in many manuscripts written in two words, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;  ei de, instead of &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;  ide. If this, as is probable, is the correct reading there, it should be rendered, "if now thou art," etc. Thus, the Syriac, Latin, and Arabic read it.<p>Thou art called - Thou art named Jew, implying that this name was one of very high honor. This is the first thing mentioned on which the Jew would be likely to pride himself.<p>A Jew - This was the name by which the Hebrews were at that time generally known; and it is clear that they regarded it as a name of honor, and valued themselves much on it; see <a href="/galatians/2-15.htm">Galatians 2:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>. Its origin is not certainly known. They were called the children of Israel until the time of Rehoboam. When the ten tribes were carried into captivity, but two remained, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The name Jews was evidently given to denote those of the tribe of Judah. The reasons why the name of Benjamin was lost in that of Judah, were probably,<p>(1) because the tribe of Benjamin was small, and comparatively without influence or importance.<p>(2) The Messiah was to be of the tribe of Judah <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; and that tribe would therefore possess a consequence proportioned to their expectation of that event.<p>The name of Jews would therefore be one that would suggest the facts that they were preserved from captivity, that they had received remarkably the protection of God, and that the Messiah was to be sent to that people. Hence, it is not wonderful that they should regard it as a special favor to be a Jew, and particularly when they added to this the idea of all the other favors connected with their being the special people of God. The name "Jew" came thus to denote all the peculiarities and special favors of their religion.<p>And restest in the law - The word "rest" here is evidently used in the sense of trusting to, or leaning upon. The Jew leaned on, or relied on the Law for acceptance or favor; on the fact that he had the Law, and on his obedience to it. It does not mean that he relied on his own works, though that was true, but that he leaned on the fact that he had the Law, and was thus distinguished above others. The Law here means the entire Mosaic economy; or all the rules and regulations which Moses had given. Perhaps also it includes, as it sometimes does, the whole of the Old Testament.<p>Makest thy boast in God - Thou dost boast, or glory, that thou hast the knowledge of the true God, while other nations are in darkness. On this account the Jew felt himself far elevated above all other people, and despised them. It was true that they only had the true knowledge of God, and that he had declared himself to be their God, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>; but this was not a ground for boasting, but for gratitude. This passage shows us that it is much more common to boast of privileges than to be thankful for them, and that it is no evidence of piety for a man to boast of his knowledge of God. An humble, ardent thankfulness that we have that knowledge a thankfulness which leads us not to despise others, but to desire that they may have the same privilege - is an evidence of piety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-24.

From hence to the end of the chapter the Jews are particularly addressed; their several privileges and characters are commemorated, which by an ironical concession are allowed them; several charges are brought against them, even against their principal men; and the plea in favour of them, from their circumcision, is considered; and the apostle's view in the whole, is to show that they could not be justified before God by their obedience to the law of Moses: "behold"; take notice, observe it, this will be granted: "thou art called a Jew"; thou art one by name, by nation, and by religion; but no name, nor outward religion, nor a mere profession, will justify before God: <p>and restest in the law; which may be understood of their having the law and the knowledge of it, what is to be done and avoided easily, without any fatigue and labour; of their pleasing and applauding themselves with the bare having and hearing of it; of their trust and confidence in it; and of their inactivity and security in it, as persons asleep; and so of their coming short of the knowledge of the Gospel, and of Christ the end of the law for righteousness, their whole confidence being placed in that: so the Targumist in <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a> paraphrases the words, <p>"we are wise, "and in the law of the Lord", , do we trust;'' <p>and makest thy boast of God. There is a right boasting of God in opposition to boasting in the creature, when men ascribe all the blessings of nature and grace to the Lord alone, and praise him for all their enjoyments, temporal and spiritual; and when they trust in, and glory, and make their boast of Christ as the Lord their righteousness, in whom alone they are, and can be justified. But the boasting here spoken of, was such that was not right; these men boasted of their bare external knowledge of the one God, when the Gentiles around them were ignorant of him; of their being the covenant people of God, when others were aliens and strangers; and of their having the word and worship of the true God, which other nations were unacquainted with; and, on these external things they depended, which was their fault. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</span><p>(8) He proves by the testimony of David, and the other prophets, that God bestows greatest benefits upon the Jews, in giving them also the law, but that they are the most unthankful and unkind of all men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,...">Romans 2:17-20</a> contain the protasis, whose tenor <span class="ital">of censure</span> (called in question without ground by Th.

The apostle, having at the beginning of this chapter addressed himself generally to "whosoever thou art that judgest," now summons the Jew exclusively to the bar of judgment, whose claims to exemption from the general condemnation have come to the front in the preceding verses. By the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, he calls on him now to give an account of himself, and justify his pretensions if he can. The point of the argument is that the Jews were notoriously at that time no better than other nations in moral conduct - nay, their national character was such as to bring their very religion into disrepute among the heathen - and therefore <span class="accented">doing</span>, and not either privilege, knowledge, or profession, being according to the very <span class="accented">Law</span> on which they rested the test required, their whole ground for national exemption was taken away. <span class="cmt_word">And retest on law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, here without the article, so as to emphasize the <span class="accented">principle</span> on which the Jew professed to rest for acceptance), <span class="cmt_word">and makest thy boast of God</span>.
