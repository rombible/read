neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:...">Romans 2:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">For he is not a Jew </span>— In the most important sense, that is, one of God’s beloved people; or a true child of Abraham, to whom the promise belongs, and one that God will own for a true member of his church; <span class="ital">who is one outwardly — </span>Only; or one of Abraham’s posterity, according to the flesh, and enjoys the outward privileges belonging to that relation. <span class="ital">Neither is that circumcision — </span>The chief and true circumcision, acceptable to God; <span class="ital">which is outward in the flesh </span>— Consists only in the outward ordinance, and the mark imprinted on the flesh. <span class="ital">But he is a Jew </span>— One of Abraham’s spiritual seed; <span class="ital">who is one inwardly </span>— Who inwardly possesses the disposition of Abraham, and imitates him in his faith and obedience. In this sense, the pious Gentiles, though uncircumcised, and members of no visible church, were really Jews, or children of Abraham, entitled to the blessings of the covenant which God made with him. It is of such as these that Christ speaks, in his epistle to the church at Smyrna, <a href="/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>; <span class="ital">I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. And circumcision is that of the heart </span>— The circumcision which renders men the sons of Abraham, and the people of God, <span class="ital">is of the heart, </span>made by cutting off or mortifying its lusts. That this is the true circumcision, or the thing meant by that rite, is evident from the command of Moses to the Jews, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, <span class="ital">Circumcise the foreskin of your hearts, and be no more stiff-necked; </span>and from the promise made to the same people, <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>, <span class="ital">The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. In the spirit </span>— Seated in the inmost soul, renewed by the Spirit of God. Or the expression may mean, according to the spiritual sense of the law; <span class="ital">and not in the letter — </span>Not in an external ceremony, performed only according to the letter of it. <span class="ital">Whose praise is not of men </span>— Who look only on the outward appearance, and will probably be so far from esteeming, that they will despise and hate such; <span class="ital">but of God </span>— Who sees in secret, and approves of what is internally holy and spiritual. It is justly observed by Macknight here, that the apostle, by distinguishing between the spirit and the letter of the law of Moses, intimates that the rites enjoined in that law were typical, and had a spiritual or moral meaning, as Moses also expressly declared to the Jews, <a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm" title="And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:">Leviticus 26:41</a>, and in the passages of Deuteronomy above quoted. Jeremiah, likewise, <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, represents circumcision as emblematical; consequently all the other rites of the law were so likewise. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:25-29 No forms, ordinances, or notions can profit, without regenerating grace, which will always lead to seeking an interest in the righteousness of God by faith. For he is no more a Christian now, than he was really a Jew of old, who is only one outwardly: neither is that baptism, which is outward in the flesh: but he is the real Christian, who is inwardly a true believer, with an obedient faith. And the true baptism is that of the heart, by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; bringing a spiritual frame of mind, and a willing following of truth in its holy ways. Let us pray that we may be made real Christians, not outwardly, but inwardly; in the heart and spirit, not in the letter; baptized, not with water only, but with the Holy Ghost; and let our praise be, not of men, but of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he is not a Jew ... - He who is merely descended from Abraham, and is circumcised, and externally conforms to the Law only, does not possess the true character, and manifest the true spirit, contemplated by the separation of the Jewish people.

It contemplated much more; see <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, &c.&#8212;In other words, the name of "Jew" and the rite of "circumcision" were designed but as outward symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world unto holy devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation. Where this is realized, the signs are full of significance; but where it is not, they are worse than useless.<p>Note, (1) It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed and fitted to melt only hardens the heart (Ro 2:4, and compare 2Pe 3:9; Ec 8:11). (2) Amidst all the inequalities of religious opportunity measured out to men, and the mysterious bearing of this upon their character and destiny for eternity, the same great principles of judgment, in a form suited to their respective discipline, will be applied to all, and perfect equity will be seen to reign throughout every stage of the divine administration (Ro 2:11-16). (3) "The law written on the heart" (Ro 2:14, 15)&#8212;or the Ethics of Natural Theology&#8212;may be said to be the one deep foundation on which all revealed religion reposes; and see on [2185]Ro 1:19, 20, where we have what we may call its other foundation&#8212;the Physics and Metaphysics of Natural Theology. The testimony of these two passages is to the theologian invaluable, while in the breast of every teachable Christian it wakens such deep echoes as are inexpressibly solemn and precious. (4) High religious professions are a fearful aggravation of the inconsistencies of such as make them (Ro 2:17-24). See 2Sa 12:14. (5) As no external privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield the unholy from the wrath of God, so neither will the want of them shut out from the kingdom of heaven such as have experienced without them that change of heart which the seals of God's covenant were designed to mark. In the sight of the great Searcher of hearts, the Judge of quick and dead, the renovation of the character in heart and life is all in all. In view of this, have not all baptized, sacramented disciples of the Lord Jesus, who "profess that they know God, but in works deny Him," need to tremble&#8212;who, under the guise of friends, are "the enemies of the cross of Christ?"   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He is not a Jew; </span> a right or true Jew, who is heir of the promises made to the fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That is one outwardly; </span> the word <span class="ital">only</span> is to be understood: see <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither is that circumcision; </span> the right and true circumcision, which God principally requires, and is available unto salvation: that circumcision is not much to be accounted of which is only the cutting off an outward skin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,....

In true Judaism also the Holy Ghost is the divine active principle (comp <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>). So much the less reason is there for making <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΎΜΑ</span></span></span> in our passage mean the true Jewish <span class="ital">public spirit</span> proceeding from God (de Wette, comp Tholuck); or the <span class="ital">spirit of the law</span>, in contrast to its outward observance (van Hengel, who wrongly urges the absence of the article); or the <span class="ital">new life-principle in man</span>, wrought in him by the Spirit of God (Rückert, comp Luther’s gloss); on the contrary, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΎΜΑ</span></span></span> is to be left as the objective, concrete <span class="ital">divine</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεύμα</span>, as the <span class="ital">Holy Spirit</span> in the definite sense, and as distinguished from the spiritual conditions and tendencies which He <span class="ital">produces</span>. The correct and clear view is held by Grotius, Fritzsche, and Philippi; compare Hofmann. Others, as Theodore of Mopsuestia, Oecumenius (Chrysostom and Theophylact express themselves very indefinitely), Erasmus, Beza, Toletus, Heumann, Morus, Rosenmüller, Reiche, Mehring, take <span class="greekheb">πνεύμα</span> as meaning <span class="ital">the spirit of man</span>. But that the circumcision of the heart takes place in the spirit of man, is self-evident; and the similar contrast between <span class="greekheb">πνεύμα</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΡΆΜΜΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, clearly excludes the reference to the human spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὟ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">of which</span>, is <span class="ital">neuter</span>, and refers to the entire description of the true Jewish nature in <a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>. The epexegetical relative definition hears to it an <span class="ital">argumentative</span> relation: <span class="ital">id quod laudem suam habet</span> etc. <span class="greekheb">οὗ γε</span> would be still more emphatic. To interpret it as <span class="ital">masculine</span> with reference to <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖος</span> (Augustine, Erasmus, Beza, Bengel, and many others; including Reiche, Rückert, Köllner, de Wette, Olshausen, Tholuck, Fritzsche, Philippi, Ewald, and Hofmann; compare van Hengel), is, especially seeing that Paul has not written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὯΝ</span></span></span>, as in <a href="/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a> (Schoem. <span class="ital">a</span>[722]<span class="ital"> Is.</span> p. 243), a very unnecessary violence, which Grotius, who is followed by Th.

As is often the case in classic authors, the neuter of the relative belongs to the entire sentence; see especially Richter, <span class="ital">de anac. gr. linguae</span>, § 28; Matthiae, II. p. 987 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔπαινος</span>] <span class="ital">i.e. the due praise</span> (not <span class="ital">recompense</span>).

The argument of the foregoing verses assumes what is stated here, and what no one will dispute, that what constitutes the Jew in the true sense of the term, and gives the name of Jew its proper content and dignity, is not anything outward and visible, but something inward and spiritual. And the same remark applies to circumcision itself. The most natural way to read the Greek seems to me to be this. “Not he who is so outwardly (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ</span>) is a Jew (in the true sense), nor is that which is outward, in flesh, the true circumcision; but he who is inwardly a Jew (is the true Jew), and heart circumcision, in spirit, not in letter (is the true circumcision).” Thus in the first pair of clauses there is not anything, strictly speaking, to be supplied; the subject is in each case involved in the article. But in the second pair the predicate has in both cases to be supplied from the first—in the one case, <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖος</span>; in the other, <span class="greekheb">περιτομή</span>. Heart circumcision is an idea already familiar to the O.T. From the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, for the meaning comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>) it passed to the prophetic writings: <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a>. The contrary expression—uncircumcised in heart and in flesh—is also found: <a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>. A difficulty is created by the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι οὐ γράμματι</span>. After <a href="/romans/2-28.htm" title="For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:">Romans 2:28</a> we rather expect <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι οὐ σαρκί</span>: the circumcision being conceived as in one and not another part of man’s nature. Practically it is in this sense most commentators take the words: thus Gifford explains them by “a circumcision which does not stop short at outward conformity to the law, but extends to the sphere of the inner life”. But there is no real correspondence here, such as there is in <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι οὐ σαρκί</span>; and a comparison of 2 Corinthians 3, a chapter pervaded by the contrast of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">γράμμα</span>, suggests a different rendering. <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">γράμμα</span> are not the elements in which, but the powers by which, the circumcision is conceived to be effected. “Heart circumcision,” without any qualifying words, expresses completely that contrast to circumcision in the flesh, which is in Paul’s mind; and what he adds in the new words, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι οὐ γράμματι</span> is the new idea that heart circumcision, which alone deserves the name of circumcision, is achieved by the Spirit of God, not by the written law. Whether there is such a thing as this heart circumcision, wrought by the Spirit, among the Jews, is not explicitly considered; but it is not a refutation of this interpretation to point out that <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in 2 Cor. is characteristically the gift of the New Covenant. For the very conclusion to which Paul wishes to lead is that the New Covenant is as necessary for the Jew as for the Gentile. <span class="greekheb">οὗ ὁ ἔπαινος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> is masculine, and refers to the ideal Jew. The name <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖος</span> (from Judah = praise, <a href="/genesis/29-35.htm" title="And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.">Genesis 29:35</a>) probably suggested this remark. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων</span>: the love of praise from each other, and religious vanity, are Jewish characteristics strongly commented on by our Lord (<a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>; <a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a> f.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">he is not a Jew</span>] Obviously, in the sense of exclusive privilege. Q. d., “If a Jew means (as the word would mean from Pharisaic lips) a member of a body which is specially entitled to salvation, then a Jew is not made by physical circumcision, for a title to salvation must be sought in things spiritual not physical.” See for similar forcible statements, <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>, &c., <a href="/context/romans/6-15.htm" title="What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
