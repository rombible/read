There can be no question that this is the consistent doctrine of Scripture. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm" title=" Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>.) How is this to be reconciled with the main theme of the Epistle, the doctrine of justification by <span class= "ital">faith</span>?<p>We may observe (1) that the theology of St. Paul has two main sides or elements: (<span class= "ital">a</span>) that which is common to all the Jewish schools, developed in direct line from the teaching of the Old Testament, and (<span class= "ital">b</span>) that which is peculiar to himself, or developed from minute and scattered germs in the Old Testament or from the teaching of our Lord. The doctrine of justification by faith belongs to the latter category; that of final recompense in accordance with moral action belongs to the former. Hence we are prepared to find a difference of terminology without any necessary divergence of idea. (2) If we accordingly separate the two doctrines, and look at each in the connection to which it properly belongs, we shall see that they correspond to a difference in the point of view, (<span class= "ital">a</span>) The two great classes into which mankind will be divided at the judgment will be determined by <span class= "ital">works,</span> by the tangible outcome of their lives. No opposition is thought of here between the inward and the outward. Of course such an opposition is possible, but it is not present to the mind of the writer. The rule followed is simply that laid down in <a href="/matthew/7-16.htm" title="You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?">Matthew 7:16</a>, “By their fruits ye shall know them.” The nature of his actions, as the expression of his character, will decide whether a man is to be classed among “the good” or among “the wicked.” But (<span class= "ital">b</span>) if we isolate the individual, and consider him no longer in relation to other men and to the great classification of mankind, but in his own intimate relations to the Judge and to the judgment, a totally different train of thought is suggested. If the conduct of the believer is to be regarded merely in the light of obedience to law (in other words, as a question of <span class= "ital">works</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> then he can neither claim nor expect any reward at all. He has broken more commandments than he has kept, and to break the Law, though only on a single point, is to lay himself open to its penalties. In any case, the extent of the reward promised to him far exceeds in proportion the extent of his obedience. It cannot therefore be by works, but must be due to a divine act, and that act is conditioned by faith. In consideration, not of any fulfilment of the Law, but that the main tenor and direction of a man’s life has been right as proved by his faith in Christ, the grace of God is extended towards him, and makes up that in which he is behind. Though not deserving, in a strict sense, the bliss of the Messianic kingdom, the believer is, nevertheless, admitted to it on account of his faith in the great Head of that kingdom, and his participation through that faith in the Christian scheme. That scheme has been wrought out <span class= "ital">objectively, i.e.,</span> independently of him, but he by a subjective act, in other words, by <span class= "ital">faith,</span> appropriates it to himself. (3) Bearing in mind this difference in the sequence of the thought, the apparent contradiction between the two doctrines is resolved. In the doctrine of final retribution there is no opposition between faith and works, in the doctrine of justification there is no opposition between works and faith. In the former, works may be regarded as the evidence of faith; in the latter, they may be regarded as its natural and necessary outcome. They may, it is true, be set in opposition, as we shall find them later on by St. Paul himself, but that is by a special abstraction of the mind. Works are there regarded as disconnected from faith, though in the nature of things they are rather associated with it. Works may be sincere or they may be hypocritical. They may have an inward foundation in the heart, or they may not. And the Apostle looks at them in both lights, according as the course of his argument requires it. That there is no radical opposition is clearly seen if we refer to the description of the last judgment in the Synoptic Gospels. There can be no question that in those Gospels the doctrine prominently put forward is that of retribution according to works, and yet it is most distinctly laid down that the works so insisted upon are not merely the outward tangible act <span class= "ital">apart from</span> the inward disposition; on the contrary, when such works are pleaded they are expressly disowned (<a href="/context/matthew/7-23.htm" title="And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.">Matthew 7:23-24</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/25-44.htm" title="Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?">Matthew 25:44</a>); and. on the other hand, we are left to infer that the righteous will have little ostensibly to allege in their own favour (<a href="/context/matthew/25-36.htm" title="Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.">Matthew 25:36-39</a>). We are thus led up by easy stages to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith, even out of the midst of that doctrine of retribution which forms the subject of the section on which we are now commenting.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who will render - That is, who will make retribution as a righteous Judge; or who will give to every man as he deserves.<p>To every man - To each one. This is a general principle, and it is clear that in this respect God would deal with the Jew as he does with the Gentile. This general principle the apostle is establishing, that he may bring it to bear on the Jew, and to show that he cannot escape simply because he is a Jew.<p>According to his deeds - That is, as he deserves; or God will be just, and will treat every man as he ought to be treated, or according to his character. The word "deeds" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;  erga)is sometimes applied to the external conduct. But it is plain that this is not its meaning here. It denotes everything connected with conduct, including the acts of the mind, the motives, the principles, as well as the mere external act. Our word character more aptly expresses it than any single word. It is not true that God will treat people according to their external conduct: but the whole language of the Bible implies that he will judge people according to the whole of their conduct, including their thoughts, and principles, and motives; that is, as they deserve. The doctrine of this place is abundantly taught elsewhere in the Bible, <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. It is to be observed here that the apostle does not say that people will be rewarded for their deeds, (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>,) but according to &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;  kata their deeds. Christians will be saved on account of the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, but still the rewards of heaven will be according to their works; that is, they who have labored most, and been most faithful, shall receive the highest reward, or their fidelity in their Master's service shall be the measure or rule according to which the rewards of heaven shall be distributed, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-29</a>. Thus, the ground or reason why they are saved shall be the merits of the Lord Jesus. The measure of their happiness shall be according to their character and deeds. On what principle God will distribute his rewards the apostle proceeds immediately to state. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. treasurest up unto thyself wrath against&#8212;rather "in."<p>the day of wrath&#8212;that is wrath to come on thee in the day of wrath.

In other words, God will render to evil men according to the true desert of their evil deeds; and of his own free grace will render to good men, whom he has made so by his grace, what is suitable and agreeable to those good works, which, by the assistance of his grace, they have been enabled to perform. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</span><p>(3) The foundation of the former disputation, that both the Jews and Gentiles together have need of righteousness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a>.

On this, and on the following amplification down to <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, it is to be observed:—(1) Paul is undoubtedly speaking of the <span class="ital">judgment of the world</span>, which God will cause to be held by Christ, <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>; (2) The <span class="ital">subjects</span> who are judged are <span class="ital">Jews</span> and <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, <a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a> ff., consequently <span class="ital">all men</span>, <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>. The distinction, as to whether they are Christians or not, is left out of view in this exposition, as the latter is partly intended to <span class="ital">introduce</span> the reader to a knowledge of the necessity of justification by faith (down to <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>); and it is consequently also left out of view that judgment according to works cannot result in bliss for the unbelievers, because there is wanting to them the very thing whose vital action produces the works in accordance with which the Judge awards bliss, namely, faith and the accompanying regeneration.

It is neither to be looked upon as needing the <span class="ital">corrective</span> of the Christian plan of salvation; nor as an <span class="ital">inconsistency</span> (Fritzsche); nor yet in such a light, that the doctrine of justification involves a partial abrogation of the moral order of the world (Reiche), which is, on the contrary, confirmed and established by it, <a href="/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith?

T. conception of regeneration as a new creation, as a putting off of the old man, as a having died and risen again, as a being begotten of God through the Spirit, etc. etc. The new life (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>) is the direct opposite of the old (<a href="/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a> ff.). The possibility referred to is to be judged of in connection with the <span class="ital">descensus Christi ad inferos</span>, but is irrelevant here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[610] It is rightly observed by Calovius: “<span class="ital">secundum opera, i.e.</span> secundum testimonium operum,” is something different from “<span class="ital">propter opera, i.e.</span> propter meritum operum.” Comp. <span class="ital">Apol.

The law enunciated in the Psalm, that God will render to every one according to his works, is valid within the sphere of redemption as well as independent of it. Paul the Christian recognises its validity as unreservedly as Saul the Pharisee would have done. The application of it may lead to very different results in the two cases, but the universal moral conscience, be it in bondage to evil, or emancipated by Christ, accepts it without demur. Paul had no feeling that it contradicted his doctrine of justification by faith, and therefore we are safe to assert that it did not contradict it. It seems a mistake to argue with Weiss that Paul is here speaking of the <span class="ital">Urnorm</span> of the Divine righteousness, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of the way in which the destiny of men would be determined <span class="ital">if there were no Gospel</span>. The Gospel does not mean that God denies Himself; He acts in it according to His eternal nature; and though Paul is speaking to men as under the law, the truth which he is insisting upon is one which is equally true whether men are under the law or under grace. It is not a little piece of the leaven of a Jewish or Pharisaic conception of God, not yet purged out, that is found here; but an eternal law of God’s relation to man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">who will render to every man</span>, &c.] According to the promise, <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>.

So the LXX. expressly in <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm" title="If you say, Behold, we knew it not; does not he that ponders the heart consider it? and he that keeps your soul, does not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?">Proverbs 24:12</a>, and Ps. 62:13, <span class="greekheb">συ ἀποδώσεις κτλ</span>. This saying, and especially that below, <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>, is often quoted.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποδώσει</span>, <span class="ital">will render</span>) not only <span class="ital">will give</span>, but <span class="ital">will repay</span>. [<span class="ital">See that you make this the rule of your plans</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>, <span class="ital">according to</span>) Paul describes those, who shall obtain either life or death, generally, and according to the condition [or else <span class="ital">in a way suited to the apprehension</span>] of those, with whom he is concerned in this place, cutting them off still from all special ground of obtaining or losing salvation. Therefore, this passage is of no advantage to the argument for the merit of good works.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will render to every man according to his works</span>. This assertion is no contradiction of the main portion of the Epistle as it proceeds, as to justification being not of works; the phrase here being, not on <span class="accented">account of</span> his works, but <span class="accented">according</span> to them. "Nequaquam tamen quid valeant, sed quid illis debeatur pretii pronunciat" (Calvin). The <span class="accented">ground</span> of justification is not here involved. All that is asserted is what is essential to any true conception of God's justice, viz. that he has regard to <span class="accented">what men are</span> in assigning reward or punishment; it is what is given in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> as a first principle of faith about God, "that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him." It is further evident from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, and still more from all that follows, that all such will be so rewarded, whether before Christ or after his coming, whether knowing him or not knowing him. Nor is the inclusion of the latter inconsistent with the doctrine that salvation is through Christ alone. For the effect of his atonement is represented as retrospective as well as prospective, and as availing virtually for all mankind (cf. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15, 18, 20</a>). Hence the narrow doctrine of some divines, who would confine the possibility of salvation to those who have had in some way during life a conscious faith in the atonement, is evidently not the doctrine of St. Paul. </body></html>
