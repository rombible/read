For he is no more a Christian now, than he was really a Jew of old, who is only one outwardly: neither is that baptism, which is outward in the flesh: but he is the real Christian, who is inwardly a true believer, with an obedient faith. And the true baptism is that of the heart, by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; bringing a spiritual frame of mind, and a willing following of truth in its holy ways. Let us pray that we may be made real Christians, not outwardly, but inwardly; in the heart and spirit, not in the letter; baptized, not with water only, but with the Holy Ghost; and let our praise be, not of men, but of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he is a Jew - He comes up to the design of the Jewish institution; he manifests truly what it is to be a Jew.<p>Which is one inwardly - Who is "in heart" a Jew. Who has the true spirit, and fulfils the design of their being separated as a special people. This passage proves that the design of separating them was not merely to perform certain external rites, or to conform to external observances, but to be a people holy in heart and in life. It cannot be denied that this design was not generally understood in the time of the apostles; but it was abundantly declared in the Old Testament: <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-20</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7-23</a>.<p>And circumcision is that of the heart - That is, that circumcision which is acceptable to God. and which meets the design of the institution, is what is attended with holiness of heart; with the cutting off of sins; and with a pure life. The design of circumcision was to be a sign of separation from the pagan world, and of consecration to the holy God. And this design implied the renunciation and forsaking of all sins; or the cutting off of everything that was offensive to God. This was a work especially of the heart. This design was often stated and enforced in the writings of the Old Testament; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, "Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked;" <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>.<p>In the spirit - This is an expression explaining further what he had just said. It does not mean by the Holy Spirit, but that the work was to take place in the soul, and not in the body only. It was to be an internal, spiritual work, and not merely an external service.<p>And not in the letter - That is, not only according to the literal, external command,<p>Whose praise ... - Whose object is not to secure the praise of human beings. One of the main characteristics of the Jews in the time of Christ was, a desire to secure honor among men, as being exactly scrupulous in the performance of all the duties of their religion. They prided themselves on their descent from Abraham, and on their regular conformity to the precepts of the Law of Moses; <a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm">Luke 18:10-12</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>.<p>But of God - "Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart;" <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. The praise of God can be bestowed only on those who conform really, and not externally only, to his requirements.<p>The remarks which are made here respecting the Jews, are also strictly applicable to professing Christians, and we may learn,<p>1. That the external rites of religion are of much less importance than the state of the heart.<p>2. That the only value of those rites is to promote holiness of heart and life.<p>3. That the mere fact that we are born of pious ancestors will not save us.<p>4. That the fact that we were dedicated to God in baptism will not save us.<p>5. That a mere profession of religion, however orthodox may be our creed, will not save us.<p>6.

Where this is realized, the signs are full of significance; but where it is not, they are worse than useless.<p>Note, (1) It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed and fitted to melt only hardens the heart (Ro 2:4, and compare 2Pe 3:9; Ec 8:11). (2) Amidst all the inequalities of religious opportunity measured out to men, and the mysterious bearing of this upon their character and destiny for eternity, the same great principles of judgment, in a form suited to their respective discipline, will be applied to all, and perfect equity will be seen to reign throughout every stage of the divine administration (Ro 2:11-16). (3) "The law written on the heart" (Ro 2:14, 15)&#8212;or the Ethics of Natural Theology&#8212;may be said to be the one deep foundation on which all revealed religion reposes; and see on [2185]Ro 1:19, 20, where we have what we may call its other foundation&#8212;the Physics and Metaphysics of Natural Theology. The testimony of these two passages is to the theologian invaluable, while in the breast of every teachable Christian it wakens such deep echoes as are inexpressibly solemn and precious. (4) High religious professions are a fearful aggravation of the inconsistencies of such as make them (Ro 2:17-24). See 2Sa 12:14. (5) As no external privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield the unholy from the wrath of God, so neither will the want of them shut out from the kingdom of heaven such as have experienced without them that change of heart which the seals of God's covenant were designed to mark. In the sight of the great Searcher of hearts, the Judge of quick and dead, the renovation of the character in heart and life is all in all. In view of this, have not all baptized, sacramented disciples of the Lord Jesus, who "profess that they know God, but in works deny Him," need to tremble&#8212;who, under the guise of friends, are "the enemies of the cross of Christ?"   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He is a right and true Jew, an Israelite indeed, that hath taken away the foreskin of his heart, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a></span>; that is cleansed from all corrupt affections, and hath laid aside all superfluity of naughtiness; that worshippeth God in the Spirit, rejoiceth in Christ Jesus, and hath no confidence in the flesh. Such are the circumcision and Jews indeed: see <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Philippians 3:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he is a Jew which is one inwardly,.... Who has an internal work of grace upon his soul: who has not only an outward name, but an inward nature; not the law of God in the hand, but in the heart; not an external righteousness only, but internal holiness; and who is not a mere outward court worshipper, but a worshipper of God in Spirit and in truth. The Jews have a (e) saying themselves, <p>"that whosoever denies idolatry, , "is called a Jew":'' <p>so that, according to them, this is a name that is not confined to themselves, but belongs to all such who truly fear and worship God; and they say, in the same place, that Pharaoh's daughter was called  "a Jewess", because she denied idolatry, and went down to wash herself from the idols of her father's house. And elsewhere (f), <p>"that faith does not depend upon circumcision, but upon the heart: he that believes not as he should, circumcision does not make him a Jew; and he that believes as he ought, he indeed is a Jew, though he is not circumcised.'' <p>And circumcision is that of the heart; which God requires, and he himself promises to give, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, upon which last passage, a very noted Jew (g) has this observation,   , "this is the circumcision of the heart"; the very phrase the apostle here uses: circumcision of the flesh was typical of this, which lies in a godly sorrow for sin, in a putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, and in renouncing a man's own righteousness in the business of justification. The ancient Jews had some notion of this typical use of circumcision. So Philo the Jew says (h), that circumcision taught    , "the cutting off of all pleasures and affections": and elsewhere he says (i): it is a symbol of two things particularly; the one is the cutting off of pleasures, as before; and the other is the removal of arrogancy, that grievous disease of the soul: and in another place (k) he calls purity, or chastity, , "the circumcision of circumcision". Now this our apostle says is <p>in the spirit; meaning either the spirit or soul of man, which is the seat and subject of it; or the Spirit of God, who is the author of it: the Ethiopic version reads it, "by the Holy Ghost": <p>and not in the letter; or "by the letter" of the law; but the Holy Ghost produces this spiritual work instrumentally, by the preaching of the Gospel. To which the apostle adds, <p>whose praise is not of men, but of God; referring not to circumcision immediately spoken of before, but to the Jew who is one inwardly: and alludes to the name Judah, from whence the Jews are called, which comes from the word  which signifies to "praise"; and intimates here, that such persons must not expect praise from men, who are only taken, with outward things, but from God, who searches and knows the heart. <p>(e) T.
