And the true baptism is that of the heart, by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; bringing a spiritual frame of mind, and a willing following of truth in its holy ways.

Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the &#8230; law, &c.&#8212;Two mistaken interpretations, we think, are given of these words: First, that the case here supposed is an impossible one, and put merely for illustration [Haldane, Chalmers, Hodge]; second that it is the case of the heathen who may and do please God when they act, as has been and is done, up to the light of nature [Grotius, Olshausen, &c.]. The first interpretation is, in our judgment, unnatural; the second, opposed to the apostle's own teaching. But the case here put is, we think, such as that of Cornelius (Ac 10:1-48), who, though outside the external pale of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name of Abraham. Thus, this is but another way of announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision (see on [2184]Ga 5:6); and this interpretation is confirmed by all that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Uncircumcision which is by nature; </span> a periphrasis of the Gentiles, who want circumcision, or are by nature without it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fulfil the law; </span> here is another word; before it was <span class="ital">keep, </span> but now it is <span class="ital">fulfil the law:</span> though the word be varied, yet the sense is the same: see <span class="bld"><a href="/james/2-8.htm" title="If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:">Jam 2:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judge thee; </span> i.e. rise up in judgment against thee; or else, shall he not do it by his example? as in <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41</a>,42</span>, the men of Nineveh, and the queen of Sheba, shall judge the Israelites.

But the sequence of thought is brought out much more forcibly, if we take <a href="/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a> as <span class="ital">affirmative</span>, as the reply to the question contained in <a href="/romans/2-26.htm" title="Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?">Romans 2:26</a> (as is done by Chrysostom, Erasmus, Luther, Bengel, Wetstein and others; now also by Tholuck, de Wette, van Hengel, Th. Schott, Hofmann). In this case the placing <span class="greekheb">κρινεῖ</span> first conveys a strong emphasis; and <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, as often in classic authors (Thiersch, § 354, 5 b.; Kühner, <span class="ital">a</span>[712]<span class="ital"> Xen.

But the former explanations introduce a foreign idea into the connection; and against Köllner’s view it may be urged that his declarative rendering weakens quite unnecessarily the force of the contrast of the two members of the verse. For the most natural and most abrupt contrast to the <span class="ital">uncircumcised</span> person who keeps the law is he, who <span class="ital">transgresses</span> the law <span class="ital">notwithstanding letter and circumcision</span>, and is consequently all the more culpable, because he offends against written divine direction (<span class="greekheb">γραμμ</span>.) and theocratic obligation (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΤ</span></span></span>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[712] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[713] Not so, that God in judging will apply the Gentile obedience of the law as a <span class="ital">standard for estimating</span> the Jewish transgression of it (Th.

The “letter and circumcision” are properly the <span class="ital">means</span> to a knowledge of the law, to obligation to it, and obedience under it; here they are, by paradox, the <span class="ital">means</span> to the wilful breaking of it, and not mere <span class="ital">obstacles overcome</span> by the transgressor.—“<span class="ital">The letter</span>” is the “letter of the law” of circumcision: q. d., “thou usest thy literal circumcision as a means to transgression,” a salve to thy conscience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κρινεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">shall judge</span>) Those, whom thou now judgest, will in their turn judge thee at the day of judgment, <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>. <a href="/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?...">1 Corinthians 6:2-3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τελοῦσα</span>, <span class="ital">keeping</span> (if it fulfil): a word of large meaning.

In these two concluding verses we observe the double sense in which the term <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be used. It denotes here one possessed of the true spirit of Judaism; in which sense the Gentile might be the better Jew. In a like double sense we may use the word "Christian" (cf. <a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" also ch. 4. and <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). So, too, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> for spiritual circumcision (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), in the sense of inward dedication to God's service, and "<span class="accented">putting</span> off the body of the sins of the flesh" (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; see also <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2, 3</a>). Such ethical significance of the rite appears even in the Old Testament. We read there of "uncircumcised lips" (<a href="/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12, 30</a>), or "ears" (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), or "hearts" (<a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>); and in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a> we find the significant words." The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy <span class="accented">seed</span>, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live;" and in <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">Circumcise</span> yourselves to the Loan, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem." (Cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">Put</span> on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.") <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
