The mere hearing of the Law will bring no exemption to the Jew; and, on the other hand, the Gentile, who, at the dictates of conscience, acts as if he were subject to law, shall have the full benefit that law can give him. In fact, his conscience is to him a law. He undergoes precisely the same conflict of self- condemnation and self-acquittal as one who has a written law to refer to. All this will be done, this strict measure of justice will be applied, at the last great day of judgment.<p><span class= "bld">In the law.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">in law.</span> Here, as in the phrases which follow, “by law,” “the hearers of law,” “the doers of law,” “the Gentiles which have not law,” &c., the article is wrongly inserted by the Authorised version. Its absence shows that the Apostle Lad in mind, not the particular Mosaic law, but the abstraction of law. “Behind the concrete representation—the Mosaic law itself—St. Paul sees an imperious principle, an overwhelming presence, antagonistic to grace, to liberty, to spirit, and (in some aspects) even to life—abstract law, which, though the Mosaic ordinances are its most signal and complete embodiment, nevertheless is not exhausted therein, but exerts its crushing power over the conscience in diverse manifestations. The one, the concrete and special, is <span class= "greekheb">ὁ υόμος</span>; the other, the abstract and universal, is <span class= "greekheb">νόμος</span>” (Lightfoot).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/2-12.htm" title="For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;">Romans 2:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For as many as have sinned </span>— And have not repented and brought forth fruit worthy of repentance; as many as have lived and died in the commission of known sin: he speaks as of the time past, for all time will be past at the day of judgment; <span class="ital">without law </span>— Without having had any written law, any express and outward revelation from God; <span class="ital">shall also perish </span>— Be condenmed and punished; <span class="ital">without law </span>— Without regard had to any written law, or supernatural revelation, being proved guilty by the law written in their hearts. The expression, <span class="ital">shall perish, </span>shows the agreement of the manner of <span class="ital">suffering </span>with the manner of <span class="ital">sinning. </span>He could not so properly say, <span class="ital">shall be judged </span>without law. Some understand it of the annihilation of the heathen; but both reason and Scripture assure us they shall be punished for their sins, though in a less degree than those who disobey the greater light of revelation. Since none of mankind ever lived without the law of nature, it is evident the expressions, <span class="greekheb">ανομως</span>, <span class="ital">without law, </span>in this clause, and <span class="greekheb">εν νομω</span>, <span class="ital">in, </span>or <span class="ital">under law, </span>in the following clause, cannot be understood of that law.

See note on <a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>. In this context, therefore, <span class="greekheb">νομος</span>, <span class="ital">law, </span>signifies divine revelation in general. Thus, the oracles of God, with which the Jews were intrusted, <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>, have the name of <span class="greekheb">ο νομος</span>, <span class="ital">the law, </span>often given to them in Scripture; as <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>; <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-25.htm" title="But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.">John 15:25</a>; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>; in all which passages, and many others, <span class="ital">the law </span>signifies the whole of the divine revelations, taken complexly, as they stand recorded in the Jewish Scriptures. But when these Scriptures are distinguished into parts, as <a href="/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>, where <span class="ital">the law of Moses, </span>and <span class="ital">the prophets, and the Psalms </span>are mentioned; <span class="ital">the law, </span>in that division, denotes <span class="ital">the five books of Moses </span>only, as it does likewise, <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>, <span class="ital">being witnessed by the law and the prophets. </span>In this restricted sense, the word <span class="greekheb">νομος</span>, generally, though not always, has the article prefixed, <span class="ital">the law. And as many as have sinned in, </span>or <span class="ital">under, the law </span>— That is, revelation, whether the patriarchal, the Jewish, or the Christian, <span class="ital">shall be judged by the law </span>— By the revelation wherewith they were favoured. Though the word <span class="greekheb">κριθησονται </span>sometimes signifies, <span class="ital">shall be condemned, </span>in this passage it is rightly translated, <span class="ital">shall be judged, </span>because the apostle’s intention is to show, that all who have enjoyed the benefit of an external revelation shall be more severely punished, if wicked, than the Gentiles, who have not had that advantage: an idea which is better conveyed by the expression, <span class="ital">shall be judged, </span>than it would have been by <span class="ital">shall be condemned. </span>For <span class="ital">judgment </span>implies an accurate consideration of all circumstances, whether of aggravation or of alleviation, and the passing such a sentence as appears to the judge equitable, upon due consideration of the whole case. And the meaning here is, that their guilt being aggravated by the advantages which they enjoyed, they shall be punished in proportion to it.

But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - This is used to give a reason for what he had just said, or to show on what principles God would treat man, so as not to be a respecter of persons.<p>As many - Whosoever. This includes all who have done it, and evidently has respect to the Gentile world. It is of the more importance to remark this, because he does not say that it is applicable to a few only, or to great and incorrigible instances of pagan wickedness, but it is a universal, sweeping declaration, obviously including all.<p>Have sinned - Have been guilty of crimes of any kind toward God or man.

This expression evidently means without revealed or written law, as the apostle immediately says that they had a law of nature, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14-15</a>. The word "law," &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  nomos. is often used to denote the revealed Law of God, the Scriptures, or revelation in general; <a href="/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-23.htm">Luke 2:23-24</a>; <a href="/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>, <a href="/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>.<p>Shall also perish - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  apolountai. The Greek word used here occurs frequently in the New Testament. It means to destroy, to lose, or to corrupt, and is applied to life, <a href="/matthew/10-39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>; to a reward of labor, <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; to wisdom <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>; to bottles, <a href="/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>. It is also used to denote future punishment, or the destruction of soul and body in hell, <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a>, where it is opposed to eternal life, and therefore denotes eternal death; <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>; <a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>. In this sense the word is evidently used in this verse. The connection demands that the reference should be to a future judgment to be passed on the pagan. It will be remarked here that the apostle does not say they shall be saved without law. He does not give even an intimation respecting their salvation. The strain of the argument, as well as this express declaration, shows that they who had sinned - and in the first chapter he had proved that all the pagan were sinners - would be punished. If any of the pagan are saved, it will be, therefore, an exception to the general rule in regard to them. The apostles evidently believed that the great mass of them would be destroyed. On this ground they evinced such zeal to save them; on this ground the Lord Jesus commanded the gospel to be preached to them; and on this ground Christians are now engaged in the effort to bring them to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. It may be added here, that all modern investigations have gone to confirm the position that the pagan are as degraded now as they were in the time of Paul.<p>Without law - That is, they shall not be judged by a law which they have not. They shall not be tried and condemned by the revelation which the Jews had. They shall be condemned only according to the knowledge and the Law which they actually possess. This is the equitable rule on which God will judge the world. According to this, it is not to be apprehended that they will suffer as much as those who have the revealed will of God; compare <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>; <a href="/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a>.<p>Have sinned in the law - Have sinned having the revealed will of God, or endowed with greater light and privileges than the pagan world. The apostle here has undoubted reference to the Jews, who had the Law of God, and who prided themselves much on its possession.<p>Shall be judged by the law - This is an equitable and just rule; and to this the Jews could make no objection. Yet the admission of this would have led directly to the point to which Paul was conducting his argument, to show that they also were under condemnation, and needed a Saviour. It will be observed here, that the apostle uses a different expression in regard to the Jews from what he does of the Gentiles. He says of the former, that they "shall be judged;" of the latter, that they "shall perish." It is not certainly known why he varied this expression. But if conjecture may be allowed, it may have been for the following reasons.<p>(1) if he had a affirmed of the Jews that they should perish, it would at once have excited their prejudice, and have armed them against the conclusion to which he was about to come. Yet they could bear the word to be applied to the pagan, for it was in accordance with their own views and their own mode of speaking, and was strictly true.<p>(2) the word "judged" is apparently more mild, and yet really more severe. It would arouse no prejudice to say that they would be judged by their Law. It was indeed paying a sort of tribute or regard to that on which they prided themselves so much, the possession of the Law of God. Still, it was a word. implying all that he wished to say, and involving the idea that they would be punished and destroyed. If it was admitted that the pagan would perish; and if God was to judge the Jews by an unerring rule, that is, according to their privileges and light; then it would follow that they would also be condemned, and their own minds would come at once to the conclusion. The change of words here may indicate, therefore, a nice tact, or delicate address in argument, urging home to the conscience an offensive truth rather by the deduction of the mind of the opponent himself than by a harsh and severe charge of the writer. In instances of this, the Scriptures abound; and it was this especially that so eminently characterized the arguments of our Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

So frequently in the Apocrypha, and of particular laws also in classical writers. To question this use of it in the N. T. (van Hengel, Th.

In point of fact, no doubt, there was only one law given by God, the Mosaic, and Paul is arguing against those who imagined that the mere possession of it put them in a position of privilege as compared with those to whom it was not given; but he expresses himself with a generality which would meet the case of more such revelations of God’s will having been made to man. As many as sin “without law” shall also perish “without law”. Sin and perdition are correlative in Paul. <span class="greekheb">ἀπώλεια</span> (<a href="/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>, <a href="/philippians/1-28.htm" title="And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.">Php 1:28</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm" title="Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)">Php 3:19</a>) answers to <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span>: it is final exclusion from the blessedness implied in this expression; having no part in the kingdom of God. Similarly, as many as sin “in law” shall be judged “by law”. The expression would cover any law, whatever it might be; really, the Mosaic law is the only one that has to be dealt with. The use of the aorist <span class="greekheb">ἥμαρτον</span> is difficult. Weiss says it is used as though the writer were looking back from the judgment day, when sin is simply past. Burton compares <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> and calls it a “collective historical aorist”: in either case the English idiom requires the perfect: “all who have sinned”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">For as many as have sinned</span>] The equality of Jew and Gentile is here pursued, not (as might have been expected from <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>) in the direction of privilege, but in that of responsibility and judgment. The reason for this direction is, no doubt, that the main subject of the Epistle here is sin and its results.—“<span class="ital">Have sinned</span>” is literally in the Greek <span class="bld">sinned</span>; an aorist, not a perfect. It is not safe to press <span class="ital">far</span> the distinction of these tenses in N. T. Greek. (See on <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>.)

The context here shews that the word means “in the absence of a law;” and that this means “in the absence of an explicit, revealed law;” other law than the law of conscience. Similarly, the context proves that to “<span class="ital">perish</span> without law” means to perish not “<span class="ital">arbitrarily</span>,” but “<span class="ital">without an explicit code</span> as the standard of guilt.” This verse no doubt implies the truth, elsewhere so clear, that no man shall be condemned for ignorance of what was in no wise revealed to him; but its main purpose is to teach the awful truth that <span class="ital">even without the revealed law</span> there is yet real sin and real doom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">perish</span>] “Be doomed to death;” lose the soul. The Gr. word, which some have held to imply <span class="ital">annihilation of being</span>, by no means does so. Its true import is rather ruin and loss in regard of condition. The Latin <span class="ital">perditio</span> exactly renders the idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the law</span>] Where it is revealed; within range of its explicit precepts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">judged by the law</span>] To “judge” here means practically, as so often when the context is clear, to “<span class="ital">condemn:</span>” so e.g. <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm" title="Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.">Hebrews 13:4</a>.—“<span class="ital">By</span> the law,” as the <span class="ital">instrument</span> of the doom; as used in determination of the doom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole argument of this passage sufficiently decides what is meant by the Law. It is the Moral Law, the revealed Divine Will concerning right and wrong in respect both of God and man.

The change from perish to judge is suggested by by the law. "The Jews alone will be, strictly speaking, subjected to a detailed inquiry such as arises from applying the particular articles of a code" (Godet). Both classes of men shall be condemned; in both the result will be perishing, but the judgment by the law is confined to those who have the law. </body></html>
