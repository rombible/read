All the ancient Greek commentators, as Whitby has shown, interpreted this passage not of the Gentiles who had been converted to Christianity, but of those Gentiles who had not been favoured with a revealed law, and therefore were neither proselytes to Judaism nor Christianity. <span class="ital">Who show — </span>To themselves and others, and, in a sense, to God himself, <span class="ital">the work of the law </span>— In its most important moral precepts, in the substance, though not in the letter of them; <span class="ital">written in their hearts </span>— By the same divine hand which wrote the commandments on the tables of stone; <span class="ital">their conscience also bearing witness </span>— For or against them, or testifying how far they have complied with their light or law.

Hence the apostle meant it to be inferred, that it was not the having, or knowing the law, (<a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>,) nor the condemning others for the transgression of it, could avail a man, but the doing of it, or walking according to it. We may observe further on this verse, that, as the law in this context signifies divine revelation, the work of the law must be men’s duty, which revelation discovers by its precepts, which is also in part discovered by men’s natural reason and conscience, influenced by the light and grace of God; on which account it is said to be written on their hearts. Thus, in the compass of two verses, the apostle hath explained what the light of nature is, and demonstrated that there is such a light existing. It is a revelation from God written originally on the heart or mind of man; consequently is a revelation common to all nations; and, so far as it goes, it agrees with the things written in the external revelation which God hath made to some nations. We are compelled, however, when we come to consider matters of fact, to acknowledge that this light of nature has been dreadfully obscured and corrupted, even in the most learned and civilized heathen nations upon earth, as the apostle has proved at large in the latter part of the preceding chapter. And long before the ages referred to by him, <span class="ital">All flesh had corrupted its way, </span><a href="/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm" title="The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.">Genesis 6:11</a>; <span class="ital">darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people, </span><a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm" title="For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise on you, and his glory shall be seen on you.">Isaiah 60:2</a>; <span class="ital">there was none that understood, </span>(<a href="/romans/3-11.htm" title="There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.">Romans 3:11</a>;) <span class="ital">and all were alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them, </span><a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>, &c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when - The apostle, in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>, had stated a general principle, that the doers of the Law only can be justified, if justification is attempted by the Law. In this verse and the next, he proceeds to show that the same principle is applicable to the pagan; that though they have not the written Law of God, yet that they have sufficient knowledge of his will to take away every excuse for sin, and consequently that the course of reasoning by which he had come to the conclusion that they were guilty, is well founded. This verse is not to be understood as affirming, as an historical fact, that any of the pagan ever did perfectly obey the Law which they had, any more than the previous verse affirms it of the Jews, The main point in the argument is, that if people are justified by the Law, their obedience must be entire and perfect; that this is not to be external only, or to consist in hearing or in acknowledging the justice of the Law; and that the Gentiles had an opportunity of illustrating this principle as well as the Jews, since they also had a law among themselves. The word "when" &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  hotan does not imply that the thing shall certainly take place, but is one form of introducing a supposition; or of stating the connection of one thing with another, <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5-6</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>. It is, however, true that the main things contained in this verse, and the next, actually occurred, that the Gentiles did many things which the Law of God required.<p>The Gentiles - All who were not Jews.<p>Which have not the law - Who have net a revelation, or the written word of God. In the Greek the article is omitted, "who have not law," that is, any revealed law.<p>By nature - By some, this phrase has been supposed to belong to the previous member of the sentence, "who have not the law by nature." But our translation is the more natural and usual construction. The expression means clearly by the light of conscience and reason, and whatever other helps they may have without revelation. It denotes simply, in that state which is without the revealed will of God. In that condition they had many helps of tradition, conscience, reason, and the observation of the dealings of divine Providence, so that to a considerable extent they knew what was right and what was wrong.<p>Do the things - Should they not merely understand and approve, but actually perform the things required in the Law.<p>Contained in the law - Literally, the things of the Law, that is, the things which the Law requires. Many of those things might be done by the pagan, as, e. g., respect to parents. truth, justice, honesty, chastity. So far as they did any of those things, so far they showed that they had a law among themselves. And wherein they failed in these things they showed that they were justly condemned. "Are a law unto themselves." This is explained in the following verse. It means that their own reason and conscience constituted, in these things, a law, or prescribed that for them which the revealed law did to the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15. For not the hearers, &c.&#8212;As touching the Jews, in whose ears the written law is continually resounding, the condemnation of as many of them as are found sinners at the last involves no difficulty; but even as respects the heathen, who are strangers to the law in its positive and written form&#8212;since they show how deeply it is engraven on their moral nature, which witnesses within them for righteousness and against iniquity, accusing or condemning them according as they violate or obey its stern dictates&#8212;their condemnation also for all the sin in which they live and die will carry its dreadful echo in their own breasts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he preoccupates the Gentiles’ plea. They might object, that having not the law, they could not transgress, nor be culpable in judgment: see <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a></span>. To this he says, that though they had not the law written in tables of stone, as the Jews had, yet they had a law written in their hearts, which was a copy or counterpart of the other, and had in a manner the effects of it; for thereby they were instructed to do well, and debarred from doing evil, which are the two properties of all laws. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do by nature; </span> nature is opposed to Scripture and special revelation: by the direction of the law, and light of nature, they did many things which the law of Moses commanded, and forbore many things which it forbade. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are a law unto themselves; </span> i.e. they have in themselves such principles of reason and rules of equity, as are to them instead of a law, prescribing what they ought to do and avoid. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For when the Gentiles which have not the law,.... The objection of the Gentiles against their condemnation, taken from their being without the law, is here obviated. The apostle owns that they had not the law, that is, the written law of Moses, and yet intimates that they had, and must have a law, against which they sinned, and so deserved punishment, and which they in part obeyed; for these men <p>do by nature the things contained in the law. The matter and substance of the moral law of Moses agrees with the law and light of nature; and the Gentiles in some measure, and in some sort, did these things by nature; not that men by the mere strength of nature without the grace of God, can fulfil the law, or do anything that is acceptable to God; and indeed, what these men did was merely natural and carnal, and so unacceptable to God. Some understand this of nature assisted by grace, in converted Gentiles, whether before or after the coming of Christ; others expound the phrase, by nature, freely, willingly, in opposition to the servile spirit of the Jews, in their obedience to the law; though it rather seems to design the dictates of natural reason, by which they acted: and so <p>these having not the law, the written law, <p>are a law to themselves; which they have by nature and use, and which natural reason dictates to them. So Plato distinguishes the law <p>"into written and un written (q): the written law is that which was used in commonwealths; and that   "which was according to custom or nature", was called unwritten, such as not to go to market naked, nor to be clothed with women's clothes; which things were not forbidden by any law, but these were not done because forbidden by the unwritten law;'' <p>which he calls "unwritten", because not written on tables, or with ink; otherwise it was written in their minds, and which by nature and use they were accustomed to. <p>(q) Laertii Vit.

The <span class="greekheb">οἱ ποιηταὶ νόμου δικαιωθήσονται</span> just asserted did not require proof with regard to the Jews. But, as the regulative principle of the last judgment, it could not but appear to need proof with regard to the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, since that fundamental rule might seem to admit of no application to those who sin <span class="greekheb">ἀνόμως</span> and perish <span class="greekheb">ἀνόμως</span>. Now the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, though beyond the pale of the Mosaic law and not incurring condemnation according to the standard of that law, yet possess in the moral law of nature a certain substitute for the Mosaic law not given to them. It is in virtue of this state of things that they present themselves, not as excepted from the above rule <span class="greekheb">οἱ ποιηταὶ νόμου δικαιωθ</span>., but as subjected to it; namely, in the indirect way that they, although <span class="greekheb">ἄνομοι</span> in the positive sense, have nevertheless in the natural law a substitute for the positive one—which is apparent, as often as Gentiles do by nature that which the positive Mosaic law not given to them enjoins. The connection may therefore be paraphrased somewhat thus: <span class="ital">“With right and reason I say: the doers of the law shall be justified; for as to the case of the</span> <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, <span class="ital">that ye may not regard them as beyond reach of that rule, it is proved in fact by those instances, in which Gentiles, though not in possession of the law of Moses, do by nature the requirements of this law, that they are the law unto themselves, because, namely, they thereby show that its obligation stands written in their hearts,”</span> etc. It is to be observed at the same time that Paul does not wish to prove a justification of the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> really <span class="ital">occurring</span> as a <span class="ital">result</span> through the fulfilment of their natural law—a misconception against which he has already guarded himself in <a href="/romans/2-12.htm" title="For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;">Romans 2:12</a>,—but he desires simply to establish the <span class="ital">regulative principle</span> of justification through the law in the case of the Gentiles. Real actual justification by the law takes place neither among Jews nor Gentiles; because in no case is there a complete fulfilment, either, among the Jews, of the revealed law or, among the Gentiles, of the natural law—which in fact is only a substitute for the former, but at the same time forms the limit beyond which their responsibility and their judgment cannot in principle go, because they have nothing higher (in opposition to Philippi, who refers to the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα νόμου</span>, <a href="/romans/13-10.htm" title="Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.">Romans 13:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The connection of thought between <a href="/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a> and what precedes it has been very variously apprehended.

The reference to the negative half of <a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a> would only be warranted in accordance with the text, had Paul, as he might have done, inverted the order of the two parts of <a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>, and so given to the negative clause the second place.[640] And the less <span class="ital">could</span> a reader see reason to refer the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> to this negative clause in the position in which the Apostle has placed it, since <a href="/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a> speaks of Gentiles who <span class="ital">do</span> the law, by which the attention was necessarily directed, not to the negative, but to the affirmative, half of <a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ ποιηταὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[641]).[642] Such a mode of presenting the connection is even more arbitrary than if we should supply after <a href="/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a> the thought: “<span class="ital">and therewith also the Gentiles</span>” (Köllner and others), which however is quite unnecessary.

There is, indeed, when we look closely, no such thing as a man absolutely without the knowledge of God’s will, and therefore such a judgment as the Apostle has described is legitimate. Gentiles, “such as have not law” in any special shape, when they do by nature “the things of the law”—<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the things required by the law given to Israel, the only one known to the Apostle—are in spite of not having law (as is the supposition here) a law to themselves. <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> is not “the Gentiles,” but “Gentiles as such”—persons who can be characterised as “without law”.

Q. d., “Heathen sinners shall be justly condemned; <span class="ital">for</span> though without the law, they have a substitute for it:”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by nature</span>] This phrase here has to do with a contrast not of <span class="ital">nature and grace</span>, but of <span class="ital">nature and law. “Nature”</span> here means impulses which, however produced, are not due to known Revelation, or indeed to any precept <span class="ital">ab extra</span>.

It is scarcely needful to say that this is fully illustrated by ancient literature, while the same literature illustrates fully the mysterious limits of conscience and tremendous force of evil.

Without individual conscience, there could be no public moral code. But we believe the <span class="ital">main</span> reference here to be to the public code; to the <span class="ital">general</span> consciousness and opinion of heathens that right and wrong are eternally different, and that judgment is to be accordingly hereafter. This consciousness and opinion St Paul regards as influencing heathen minds <span class="ital">mutually;</span> as “<span class="ital">shewn</span>” in intercourse of thought and speech; as “<span class="ital">witnessed to</span>” by individual consciences; as coming out in “<span class="ital">reasonings</span>” philosophic or popular, concerning right and wrong; and as all pointing to a great manifestation of the truth of the <span class="ital">principle</span> at the Last Day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅταν</span>, <span class="ital">when</span>) After Paul has finished the refutation of the perverse judgment of the Jews against the Gentiles, he next proceeds to show the true judgment of God against the latter.

We observe the hypothetical form of expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;</span>, and also, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any of the Law's requirements. The Law, for instance, says, "Thou shalt not steal;" and if a Gentile, though knowing nothing of the ten commandments, on principle refrains from stealing, his conscientious honesty will have its own reward as much as that of the Jew who refrains in obedience to the revealed commandment. A few of the expressions in these verses call for consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, said to be "written in their hearts"? <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> cannot be pleonastic, as supposed by Tholuck. One view is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which is an expression frequently used elsewhere (<a href="/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27, 28</a>; <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2, 5, 10</a>); and the singular number has been explained as <span class="accented">collective</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>, and ver. 7 above (so Meyer), or as "<span class="accented">applying</span> to each of the particular cases supposed in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (so Alford). The objection to this view is that it is not the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Law that can be said to be <span class="accented">written</span>, but rather the Law itself from which the works proceed. Seeing that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> implies evident reference to the tables of the Law, it seems best to take <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as denoting the <span class="accented">efficacy</span> of the Law, as opposed to the <span class="accented">letter</span>, which alone was written on the tables. So in effect Bengel: "Legem ipsam cum sua activitate. Opponitur literae, quae est accidens." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How do they <span class="accented">show</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) this <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>? Evidently, from the context of ver. 14, by <span class="accented">doing</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doing them (as is, of course, implied) as being the <span class="accented">right</span> things to do, and approving them. The very possibility of their doing this is evidence of an innate moral sense in the human heart, which, however it may often be obscured or perverted, remains as a characteristic of humanity, and is more or less operative in all communities. "Nulls enim gens unquam sic ab humanitate abhorruit ut non se intra leges aliquas contineret. Constat absque dubio quasdam justitiae et rectitudinis conceptiones, quas Graeci <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> recant, hominum animis esse naturaliter ingenitas" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> What is exactly meant by the <span class="accented">conscience</span> witnessing, and the <span class="accented">thoughts</span> accusing or else excusing? <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is not the Law in the heart, but rather our <span class="accented">consciousness</span>, whereby wittingly, in accordance with that Law, we approve or condemn. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote a <span class="accented">joint</span> witness of conscience. In <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a> and Romans 9:1, where alone the word occurs elsewhere, it is followed by a dative, and means certainly <span class="accented">concurrent</span> witness. But, if so here, with what? Probably with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> already spoken cf. Right conduct on principle, and conscience approving, witness together to the inward law; or, conduct and conscience together witness to a man's merits or demerits in accordance with that law. Then, what is added about the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> shows how conscience operates. Reason comes into play, evoked by conscience, to reflect on its witness, and definitely condemn or approve what has been done. A kind of court of judicature is supposed. Man calls himself to the bar of his own moral judgment; his conscience adduces witness to the character of his deeds, or rather, with his deeds bears witness for or against himself; his thoughts are as advocates on both sides, arguing for condemnation or acquittal. "Observa quam erudite describat conscientiam, quum dicit nobis venire in mentem rationes, quibus quod recte factum est defendimus; rursum quae nos flagitiorum accusent et redarguant" (Calvin). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., whenever, supposing a case which may occur at any time.<p>The Gentiles<p>Rev., properly, Gentiles.
