But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To them - Whoever they may be.<p>Patient continuance - Who by perseverance in well doing, or in a good work. It means that they who so continue, or persevere, in good works as to evince that they are disposed to obey the Law of God. It does not mean those who perform one single act, but those who so live as to show that this is their character to obey God. It is the uniform doctrine of the Bible that none will be saved but those who persevere in a life of holiness, <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38-39</a>. No other conduct gives evidence of piety but what continues in the ways of righteousness. Nor has God ever promised eternal life to people unless they so persevere in a life of holiness as to show that this is their character, their settled and firm rule of action. The words well doing here denote such conduct as shall be conformed to the Law of God; not merely external conduct, but that which proceeds from a heart attached to God and his cause.<p>Seek for - This word properly denotes the act of endeavoring to find any thing that is lost, <a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48-49</a>. But it also denotes the act when one earnestly strives, or desires to obtain anything; when he puts forth his efforts to accomplish it. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God," etc. <a href="/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-24.htm">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>; <a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>. In this place it denotes an earnest and intense desire to obtain eternal life. It does not mean simply the desire of a sinner to be happy, or the efforts of those who are not willing to forsake their sins and yield to God, out the intense effort of those who are willing to forsake all their crimes, and submit to God and obey his laws.<p>Glory and honour and immortality - The three words used here, denote the happiness of the heavenly world. They vary somewhat in their meaning, and are each descriptive of something in heaven, that renders it an object of intense desire. The expressions are cumulative, or they are designed to express the happiness of heaven in the highest possible degree. The word "glory" &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  doxan denotes properly praise, celebrity, or anything distinguished for beauty, ornament, majesty, splendor, as of the sun, etc.; and then it is used to denote the highest happiness or felicity, as expressing everything that shall be splendid, rich, and grand. It denotes that there will be an absence of every thing mean, grovelling, obscure. The word "honor" (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  time&#772;n) implies rather the idea of reward, or just retribution - the honor and reward which shall be conferred in heaven on the friends of God. It stands opposed to contempt, poverty, and want among people. Here they are despised by people; there, they shall be honored by God.<p>Immortality - That which is not corruptible or subject to decay. It is applied to heaven as a state where there shall be no decay or death, in strong contrast with our present condition, where all things are corruptible, and soon vanish away. These expressions are undoubtedly descriptive of a state of things beyond the grave. They are never applied in the Scriptures to any condition of things on the earth. This consideration proves, therefore, that the expressions in the next verse, indignation, etc. apply to the punishment of the wicked beyond the grave.<p>Eternal life - That is, God will "render" eternal life to those who seek it in this manner. This is a great principle; and this shows that the apostle means by "their deeds" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, not merely their external conduct, but their inward thoughts, and efforts evinced by their seeking for glory, etc. For the meaning of the expression "eternal life," see the note at <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-10. To them who, &c.&#8212;The substance of these verses is that the final judgment will turn upon character alone.<p>by patient continuance in well-doing, &c.&#8212;Compare Lu 8:15: "That on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience"; denoting the enduring and progressive character of the new life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What he had laid down in general, he amplifies more particularly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Patient continuance; </span> or perseverance <span class="bld">in well doing, </span> which implies patience: see <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a> 24:13 <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Immortality; </span> or incorruption: he adds this to show, that the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">glory and honour</span> he speaks of was not such as the Gentiles usually sought, who made worldly glory the scope of their actions; but it was eternal in the heavens, and such as never fades away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Eternal life; </span> i.e. God will render eternal life to such: the word <span class="ital">render</span> must be supplied out of the former verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To them who by patient continuance in well doing,.... These words are descriptive of one sort of persons, to whom God will render according to their works; and must be understood not of the Gentiles, the best and most moralized among them; for they sought after worldly things, after human wisdom, and popular applause, and not after God, his honour and glory, nor after immortality, which is only brought to light by the Gospel; nor of the pharisaical Jews, who sought for righteousness by the works of the law, and honour and glory from men, and not from God; nor of any unregenerate persons, but only of such who have the true principles of grace implanted in them, whether Jews or Gentiles: now the things which these men seek after are <p>glory; not the glory of this world, nor any from the men of it; but the glory of God and Christ; to be glorious within and without, by the grace and righteousness of Christ here, and to enjoy eternal glory with him hereafter. <p>Honour; not that which Adam had in innocence, and did not abide in; but that which is, and abides with Christ, and which all the saints have, and shall have. <p>Immortality; not the immortality of the soul, which is common to all; but the incorruption of the body, or the glorious resurrection of it to everlasting life at the great day, or the incorruptible crown, and never fading inheritance of the saints in light. The manner in which these things are sought is, "by patient continuance in well doing"; by doing good works, and by doing these good works well, from a principle of faith and love, and with a view to the glory of God; and by patiently enduring reproaches and sufferings for well doing, and by persevering therein: not that these things are to be had, or are expected by the saints to be had for the sake of patience and well doing; yet they may be sought for, and looked unto, as an encouragement to well doing, and continuance therein; and though not "for", yet "in" well doing there is a reward. These words do not express that for the sake of which glory is had; but only describe the persons who seek, and the manner in which they seek for it, to whom God will render <p>eternal life, which he of his rich grace promised them before the world was, and of his free favour has put into the hands of Christ for them, and which, as a pure gift of grace, he bestows on them through him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</span><p>(d) Glory which follows good works, which he does not lay out before us as though there were any that could attain to salvation by his own strength, but, he lays this condition of salvation before us, which no man can perform, to bring men to Christ, who alone justifies the believers, as he himself concludes; see Ro 2:21-22.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>. <span class="ital">To those, who by virtue of perseverance in morally-good work seek to obtain glory and honour and immortality, eternal life</span> sc[611] <span class="greekheb">ἀποδώσει</span>.

Paul presents the moral effort under a character thus <span class="ital">specifically Christian</span>, just because he can attribute it only to <span class="ital">Christian</span> Jews and Gentiles; and hence he is only able to give his description of this first half of the subjects of future judgment, notwithstanding the generality of his language, in the <span class="ital">Christian</span> form, in which alone it really takes place. In keeping with this is also the <span class="greekheb">ζωὴν αἰώνιον</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> eternal life in the kingdom of the Messiah, <a href="/romans/5-21.htm" title="That as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 5:21</a>, <a href="/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a> f.; <a href="/galatians/6-8.htm" title="For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.">Galatians 6:8</a>.

Wolf</span>, and by most expositors, including Tholuck, Rückert, Köllner, de Wette, Olshausen, Philippi, Maier, van Hengel, Umbreit. The objection raised against it by Reiche and Hofmann, that according to the analogy of <a href="/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a> <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὑπομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. must contain the standard of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΔΏΣΕΙ</span></span></span>, and cannot therefore belong to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΗΤΟῦΣΙ</span></span></span>, is untenable, because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘʼ ὙΠΟΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἜΡΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, though attached to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΗΤΟῦΣΙ</span></span></span>, nevertheless does contain (indirectly) the standard of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΔΏΣΕΙ</span></span></span>; so that there remains only an immaterial difference, which however is in fact very consonant to the lively versatility of the Apostle’s thought. Still less weight attaches to the objection, that to seek glory and honour is not in itself a praiseworthy thing; for the <span class="ital">moral</span> tenor of the <span class="greekheb">ζητεῖν δόξαν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[614] (comp <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm" title="But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.">Matthew 6:33</a>; <a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>) is most definitely assured by <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὑπομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>.

Divine mercy gives the “patient continuance in well-doing” as well as the “glory, honour, and immortality.” It is most true that the just freedom of Scripture language frequently leaves this connexion out of <span class="ital">explicit</span> statement; but this whole Epistle tends to remind us that it is among the very foundations of truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">seek</span>] As a traveller on his homeward road seeks for (aims at, moves toward) his home.

St Paul here speaks of “perseverance in good works;” St Peter there of the “fiery trial” of faith; both as preliminary to the Master’s welcome.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">immortality</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">incorruptibility</span>. Same word as <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2 Timothy 1:10</a>. (E. V., “immortality.”) It indicates perpetuity not merely of existence but of purity and power, the immortality of heaven. See further, next note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">eternal life</span>] On these two most weighty words we can only summarize thus. (1) “<span class="ital">Life</span>,” beyond question, may, and very often does, mean more than bare existence. A “lifeless” tree, or body, yet exists, though in another state than before. In regard of <span class="ital">spiritual</span> life, it is clear that existence may be strong and conscious where there is no such “life.” See <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>. Existence, to be in this sense “life,” must contain happiness and holiness, whether in the germ (as here), or in maturity (as hereafter). (2) “<span class="ital">Eternal</span>.” Much has been written on the Greek of this word; <span class="ital">aionios</span>. But its connexion with <span class="ital">duration</span>, in derivation and usage, is certain. For N. T. usage in this respect, see e.g. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;...">2 Corinthians 4:17-18</a>. And it is equally clear that its ruling idea is <span class="ital">duration unending in respect of the period referred to</span>. If used e. g. with regard to the present world, or a human lifetime, it naturally means unending while that world, or lifetime, lasts. When applied to the unseen and ultimate world, it appears equally naturally to mean unending while that world lasts. “<span class="ital">Everlasting</span>” is thus no arbitrary equivalent for it, for both words have much the same consistent elasticity of meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῖς</span>) sc. <span class="greekheb">οὖσι</span>; comp. the following verse; for <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span> (see <a href="/acts/25-23.htm" title="And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.">Acts 25:23</a>,) is employed here nearly in the same sense as <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>, next verse; save that <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> implies a something natural to the sinner; <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>, a something supervenient [not natural, but <span class="ital">super-induced</span>].

So, too, the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui sunt ex contentione</span>; and similarly Origen, Chrysostom, OEcumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, etc. This, however, is not the classical sense of the word, which is not connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("strife"), but with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which means originally a day labourer, or a worker for hire, being so used in Homer. Hence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> meant <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> labour for wages, and came to mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> canvassing or intriguing for office, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> faction, or party-spirit (cf. Arist., 'Pol.,' 5. 2, 6; 3, 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notwithstanding the weight of ancient authority for its bearing the sense of "contention" in the New Testament, that of "faction" seems more likely and suitable in the passages where it occurs; and certainly so here, the idea seeming to be that the persons spoken of <span class="accented">factiously</span> renounced their allegiance to "the truth," obeying <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> instead. We observe how expressions are here heaped up, significant of the Divine indignation against high-handed sin, unrepented and unatoned for, of which the apostle, in very virtue of his view of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, had an awful sense (see above on Romans 1:18; and cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, etc.; and also <a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Still, neither this verse nor ver. 5 is of necessity inconsistent with other well-known passages, where St. Paul seems to contemplate God's reconciliation in the end of <span class="accented">all things</span> to himself in Christ (see <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The "indignation and wrath" spoken of in the passages before us (being, as was said under Romans 1:18, inseparable from a full conception of the eternal righteousness) may still be conceived as having a corrective as well as a punitive purpose. Nor is the doctrine which has been called that of "eternal hope" of necessity precluded by statements which imply no more than that sin, unrepented and unatoned for, must inevitably undergo its doom in the unknown regions of <span class="accented">eternity.</span> The thought, at the end of ver. 9, for the first time passes distinctly to the <span class="accented">Jew's</span> assumed exemption from the condemnation of the rest of mankind; and to this exclusively the remainder of the chapter is devoted. The "indignation," etc., it is said, will be upon the <span class="accented">Jew first</span> (cf. ch. 1:16), which may mean either <span class="accented">in the first instance</span>, or <span class="accented">principally.</span> His priority in Divine favor involves priority in retribution, while his pre-eminence in privilege carries with it corresponding responsibility (cf. <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>; also <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>-8 and <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). Then in ver. 10 a like priority is assigned to the Jew with respect to reward, the general assertion of ver. 7 being repeated (with some differ-once of expression) in order to complete the view of his prior position in both respects. For the covenant was with the Jews; the promises were to them: the Gentiles were as the wild olive tree, grafted in, and made partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).
