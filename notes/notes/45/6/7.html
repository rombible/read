This is the general proposition, the major premise, adduced in proof of what had gone before, viz., the particular proposition that he who is ethically dead is no longer the slave of sin.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he that is dead - This is evidently an expression having a proverbial aspect, designed to illustrate the sentiment just expressed. The Rabbis had an expression similar to this, "When one is dead he is free from commands." (Grotius.) So says Paul, when a man dies he is exempt from the power and dominion of his master, of him who reigned over him. The Christian had been subject to sin before his conversion. But he has now become dead to it. And as when a servant dies, he ceases to be subject to the control of his master, so the Christian being now dead to sin, on the same principle, is released from the control of his former master, sin. The idea is connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, where it is said that we should not be the slaves of sin any more. The reason of this is assigned here, where it is said that we are freed from it as a slave is freed when he dies. Of course, the apostle here is saying nothing of the future world. His whole argument has respect to the state of the Christian here; to his being freed from the bondage of sin. It is evident that he who is not freed from this bondage here, will not be in the future world. But the argument of the apostle has no bearing on that point.<p>Is freed - Greek, Is justified. The word here is used clearly in the sense of setting at liberty, or destroying the power or dominion. The word is often used in this sense; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38-39</a>; compare a similar expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1</a>, "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin." The design of the apostle is not to say that the Christian is perfect, but that sin has ceased to have dominion over him, as a master ceases to have power over a slave when he is dead. That dominion may be broken, so that the Christian may not be a slave to sin, and yet he may be conscious of many failings and of much imperfection; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. For he that is dead&#8212;rather, "hath died."<p>is freed&#8212;"hath been set free."<p>from sin&#8212;literally, "justified," "acquitted," "got his discharge from sin." As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of sin, not only to "reign unto death," but to keep its victims in sinful bondage, has been discharged once for all, by the believer's penal death in the death of Christ; so that he is no longer a "debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh" (Ro 8:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He that is dead, </span> i.e. to <span class="ital">sin, is freed from</span> it; not only in respect of the guilt thereof, which sense the marginal reading of the word seems to respect, but also in regard of the service of it. This agrees best with the context; look, as he that is dead is freed and discharged from the authority of, those who had dominion over him in his lifetime, so it is with those that are dead to sin.

The conception of <span class="ital">ethical</span> dying recurs only in <span class="ital">the sequel</span>, and hence <span class="greekheb">σὺν Χριστῳ</span> is added to <span class="greekheb">ἀπεθάνομεν</span> in <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>, so that Paul in this development of his views draws a sharp distinction between the being dead in the spiritual (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>) and in the ordinary sense.

Just for this reason has Paul added <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span> (comp <a href="/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/26-29.htm" title="A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.">Sir 26:29</a>; <span class="ital">Test. XII. patr.</span> p. 541), which would have been quite superfluous, had he taken <span class="greekheb">δεδικαίωται</span>, <span class="ital">justus constitutus est</span>, in the dogmatic sense of his doctrine of justification. The proposition itself, moreover, <span class="ital">is an axiom of the popular traditional mode of view</span>, which Paul uses for his purpose as <span class="ital">admitted</span>. This axiom has also its relative truth, and that partly in so far as the dead person has put off the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς σαρκός</span> with which he committed his sins (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>), partly in so far as with death the dominion of law over the man ceases (<a href="/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?">Romans 7:1</a>), and partly in so far as in death all the relations are dissolved which supplied in life the objects of sinning.[1419] For the discussion of the question as to the absolute truth of the proposition, in its connection with Biblical anthropology and eschatology, there was no occasion at all here,[1420] where it is only used as an auxiliary clause, and ex concesso. Comp <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a>. Usteri mistakenly explains it: by death man has suffered the <span class="ital">punishment</span>, and thus <span class="ital">expiated</span> his guilt. For that Paul does not here express the Jewish dogma: “death as the punishment for sin <span class="ital">expiates</span> the guilt of sin” (see Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdeckt. Judenth</span>. II. p. 283 f.) is proved partly by the irrelevancy of such a sense to the context (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>); and partly by its inconsistency with the doctrines of the Apostle as to justification by faith and as to the judgment, according to which death cannot set free from the guilt-obligation of sin. Ewald makes a <span class="ital">new</span> idea be brought in at <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a> : “Even in common life, in the case of one who is dead, the sins of his previous life cannot be further prosecuted and punished, he passes for justified and acquitted of sin.…; if in addition sin as a power has been broken by Christ (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm" title="Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.">Romans 6:9</a> f.), then we may assuredly believe,” etc., <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>. But <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> in <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a> indicates its connection with <span class="ital">what goes before</span>, so that it is only <span class="ital">with the</span> <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> in <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a> that a new thought is introduced.

Finally, it is not clear how that rule of common law was to serve as a joint ground for the faith of becoming alive with Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1419] The Greek expositors—who already give substantially our explanation—have confined themselves to this point. Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἀπήλλακται τὸ λοιπὸν τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν νεκρὸς κείμενος</span>.

Here we have the general principle on which the foregoing argument rests: death annuls all obligations, breaks all ties, cancels all old scores. The difficulty is that by the words <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span> Paul introduces one particular application of the principle—the one he is concerned with here—as if it were identical with the principle itself. “Death clears men of all claims, especially (to come to the case before us) it clears us, who have died with Christ, of the claim of sin, our old master, to rule over us still.” Weiss would reject the introduction into this clause of the idea of dying <span class="ital">with Christ</span>, on the ground that the words <span class="greekheb">σὺν Χριστῷ</span> bring it in <span class="ital">as a new idea</span> in the following verse. But it is no new idea; it is the idea of the whole passage; and unless we bring it in here, the quittance <span class="ital">from sin</span> (and not from any obligation in general) remains inexplicable.
