The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart the gospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the same metal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, so the believer has become a new creature. And there is great difference in the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery, which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whom he is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son and heir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in being willingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power, struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, once were the slaves of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know ye not ... - The objection noticed in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm">Romans 6:15</a>, the apostle answers by a reference to the known laws of servitude or slavery, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-20</a>, and by showing that Christians, who had been the slaves of sin, have now become the servants of righteousness, and were therefore bound by the proper laws of servitude to obey their new master: as if he had said, "I assume that you know: you are acquainted with the laws of servitude; you know what is required in such cases." This would be known to all who had been either masters or slaves, or who had observed the usual laws and obligations of servitude.<p>To whom ye yield yourselves - To whom ye give up yourselves for servitude or obedience. The apostle here refers to voluntary servitude; but where this existed, the power of the master over the time and services of the servant was absolute. The argument of the apostle is, that Christians had become the voluntary servants of God, and were therefore bound to obey him entirely. Servitude among the ancients, whether voluntary or involuntary, was rigid, and gave the master an absolute right over his slave, <a href="/luke/17-9.htm">Luke 17:9</a>; <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>. To obey. To be obedient; or for the purpose of obeying his commands.<p>To whom ye obey - To whom ye come under subjection. That is, you are bound to obey his requirements.<p>Whether of sin - The general law of servitude the apostle now applies to the case before him. If people became the servants of sin, if they gave themselves to its indulgence, they would obey it, let the consequences be what they might. Even with death, and ruin, and condemnation before them; they would obey sin. They give indulgence to their evil passions and desires, and follow them as obedient servants even if they lead them down to hell. Whatever be the consequences of sin. yet he who yields to it must abide by them, even if it leads him down to death and eternal woe.<p>Or of obedience ... - The same law exists in regard to holiness or obedience. The man who becomes the servant of holiness will feel himself bound by the law of servitude to obey, and to pursue it to its regular consequences.<p>Unto righteousness - Unto justification; that is, unto eternal life. The expression stands contrasted with "death," and doubtless means that he who thus becomes the voluntary servant of holiness, will feel himself bound to obey it, unto complete and eternal justification and life; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21-22</a>. The argument is drawn from what the Christian would feel of the nature of obligation. He would obey him to Whom he had devoted himself.<p>(This would seem to imply that justification is the effect of obedience. &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  Dikaiosune&#772;, however, does not signify justification, but righteousness, that is, in this case, personal holiness. The sense is, that while the service of sin leads to death, that of obedience issues in holiness or righteousness. It is no objection to this view that it does not preserve the antithesis, since "justification" is not the opposite of "death," any more than holiness. "There is no need," says Mr. Haldane, "that there should be such an exact correspondence in the parts of the antithesis, as is supposed. And there is a most obvious reason why it could not be so. Death is the wages of sin, but life is not the wages of obedience.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey&#8212;with the view of obeying him.<p>his servants ye are to whom ye obey&#8212;to whom ye yield that obedience.<p>whether of Sin unto death&#8212;that is, "issuing in death," in the awful sense of Ro 8:6, as the sinner's final condition.<p>or of Obedience unto righteousness&#8212;that is, obedience resulting in a righteous character, as the enduring condition of the servant of new Obedience (1Jo 2:17; Joh 8:34; 2Pe 2:19; Mt 6:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He refutes the aforementioned cavil by a common axiom, that every one knows and apprehends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of obedience unto righteousness; </span> which will be rewarded with eternal life.

The apostle goes on with his answer to the above objection, by making use of an argument from the nature of servants and their obedience, a thing well known to everyone, and which none could be ignorant of; which he delivers by way of distribution, that such who yield themselves <p>servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness: such who obey sin, are the servants of sin; they are at the beck and command of sin; they give up themselves to the service of it with delight and diligence, and are perfect drudges to it: this is a very unhappy situation; their service is very unreasonable; and they are rendered incapable of serving God, for no man can serve two masters; they are hereby brought into the drudgery of the devil; into a state of bondage, out of which nothing but grace can extricate them; into a very mean and contemptible condition, and even a deplorable one; for if grace prevent not, they will have the wages of sin paid them, which is death, for their obedience is "of sin unto death"; which will lie in an eternal separation from Father, Son, and Spirit, in a sense of divine wrath, and in the company of devils and damned spirits: now this is added, to show the malignant nature and just demerit of sin, and to deter and dissuade persons from the service of it: on the other hand, such as obey the Lord, are the servants "of obedience unto righteousness": but why is not this obedience, which is the obedience of faith to the Gospel, of Christ, and of the new man to God or Christ, said to be "unto life", as the antithesis seems to require? because though death is the fruit of sin, yet life is not the fruit of obedience, but the fruit of obedience is righteousness; by which is meant, nor a justifying one before God, but righteousness before men; or a course of living soberly and righteously, which is the effect of being under grace; and hence it appears, that true believers can make no such ill use of their privilege, as is suggested in the objection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>.

On the contrary <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, antithetically correlative with the <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span>, must be conceived as the <span class="ital">final result</span> of that <span class="greekheb">δοῦλον εἶναι ὑπακοῆς</span>, and apply to the time of final perfection in the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>, when the faithful, who have not relapsed into the service of sin, but in their faith have been servants of obedience, on account of the death of Christ <span class="greekheb">δίκαιοι κατασταθήσονται</span>, <a href="/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a>.

God forbid.">Romans 6:15</a>), in which service is rendered to the obedience of God only, and not to sin. In accordance with the misconceptions of Hofmann, already noticed in detail (see above), there results as his sense of the whole: “<span class="ital">To whom ye place yourselves as servants at his disposal, ye are servants for the purpose of obedience; ye are so to him whom ye obey, servants either—for there is no third alternative—who act contrary to their master’s will and thereby merit death, or such as live in obedience and are therefore righteous in the presence of their master</span>.” What kind of a <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span>, and in what sense <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> is meant, is supposed accordingly to be self-evident. And by the following thanksgiving, <a href="/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a>, the Apostle is alleged “<span class="ital">as it were half to take back</span>” his question, Whether they do not know etc., so that the medium of transition to <a href="/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a> is “<span class="ital">why yet still the question?</span>” A series of gratuitously imported fancies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1458] c. <span class="ital">scilicet</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1459] Consequently <span class="ital">servants of sin</span>, who are serviceable to that which is sin; and then: <span class="ital">servants of obedience</span>, who are in the service of the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>, in the service of divine obedience.

Remember then, that in the very act of leaving the bond-service of sin you entered that of Pardon as taught in the Gospel, and are thus bound to <span class="ital">obey</span> as much as ever, though in the opposite direction.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto death—unto righteousness</span>] The <span class="ital">results</span> (“death,” “righteousness”) of the respective “servitudes” are not <span class="ital">necessary</span> to the immediate statement, but are brought in as inseparable from the whole subject.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">obedience</span>] This is here the personified Master, the antithesis of Sin. The context, (<a href="/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a>,) and <a href="/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>, (see also <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a>,) shew its meaning here to be <span class="ital">the act of submission to the Divine terms of pardon</span>. It is thus the practical equivalent of those terms, which are to be the <span class="ital">ruling principle</span> of the new life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">righteousness</span>] The Gr. may here be <span class="ital">paraphrased</span> (not <span class="ital">translated</span>) by Justification. In such a paraphrase we are far from shutting a moral meaning out of the word; but a careful collation of passages <span class="ital">in this Epistle</span> makes it reasonably clear that its ruling reference in this argument is to the <span class="ital">legal side</span> of righteousness; i.e. to what the <span class="ital">Law will view as righteous</span>, and so to the persons whom it will view as possessing righteousness. Such a possession, in the case of “the ungodly” (<a href="/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>), is explained by St Paul as wholly due to the righteousness of their Representative. In other words they are justified for His sake.—Thus “righteousness” is used as a summary for the process of justification, though strictly applicable only to one part of the subject. Here we may paraphrase: “Ye became the bond-servants of God’s Terms of Pardon, to which you submitted with a submission that resulted in your being reckoned righteous in the eye of His Law.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δούλους</span>, <span class="ital">servants</span>) <span class="ital">Servitude</span> is here denoted, from which <span class="ital">obedience</span> follows as a consequence.—<span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι</span>, <span class="ital">servants</span>) The state of <span class="ital">servitude</span>, which follows as the consequence of <span class="ital">obedience</span>, is signified, <a href="/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">unto</span>) <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">unto</span>, occurs twice in this verse, and in both cases it depends on <span class="ital">servants</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπακοῆς</span>, <span class="ital">of obedience</span>) <span class="ital">Obedience</span>, used absolutely, is taken in a good sense.
