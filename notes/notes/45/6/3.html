This fellowship is ethical, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it implies a moral conduct corresponding to that relation to Christ which it assumes.<p>Why has baptism this special connection with the <span class= "ital">death</span> of Christ? In the first place, the death of Christ is the central and cardinal fact of the Christian scheme. It is specially related to justification, and justification proceeds from faith, which is ratified in baptism. In the second place, the symbolism of baptism was such as naturally to harmonise with the symbolism of death. It was the final close of one period, and the beginning of another—the complete stripping off of the past and putting on of the “new man.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?...">Romans 6:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Know ye not </span>— Can any of you be ignorant of this great and obvious truth, <span class="ital">that so many of us as were baptized into Christ </span>— That is, into the profession of the Christian faith; or implanted into and made a part of the mystical body of Christ by baptism, (as <span class="greekheb">εις Χριστον </span>seems to imply,) <span class="ital">were baptized into his death </span>— Engaged by baptism to be conformed to his death, by dying to sin, as he died for it, and crucifying <span class="ital">our flesh with its affections and lusts, </span>as his body was crucified on the cross; and also were made partakers of the benefits thereof, one of which is the mortifying of sin, and all sinful passions. Being baptized into Christ, or ingrafted into him through faith, we draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit, who fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and resurrection. <span class="ital">Therefore we are buried with him </span>— Alluding to the ancient manner of baptizing by immersion; <span class="ital">by baptism into death </span>— That is, to engage us to die unto sin, and to carry on the mortification and death of it more and more: <span class="ital">that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory </span>— That is, the glorious power; <span class="ital">of the Father, even so we also </span>— In conformity thereto, should rise again by the same power; and <span class="ital">should walk in newness of life </span>— As Christ being raised from the dead lives a new life in heaven. From all this it appears, that baptism, the rite of initiation into the Christian Church, is an emblematical representation of our dying to sin, and living to righteousness, in consequence of our union with Christ as members of his body; as also of the malignity of sin, in bringing death upon Christ, (<a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>,) and upon all mankind, and of the efficacy of Christ’s death, in procuring for all pardoning mercy, renewing grace, and future glory; a resurrection both from spiritual and temporal death, to spiritual and eternal life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know ye not - This is a further appeal to the Christian profession, and the principles involved in it, in answer to the objection. The simple argument in this verse and the two following is, that by our very profession made in baptism, we have renounced sin, and have pledged ourselves to live to God.<p>So many of us ... - All who were baptized; that is, all professed Christians. As this renunciation of sin had been thus made by all who professed religion, so the objection could not have reference to Christianity in any manner.<p>Were baptized - The act of baptism denotes dedication to the service of him in whose name we are baptized. One of its designs is to dedicate or consecrate us to the service of Christ: Thus <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>, the Israelites are said to have been "baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;" that is, they became consecrated, or dedicated, or bound to him as their leader and lawgiver. In the place before us, the argument of the apostle is evidently drawn from the supposition that we have been solemnly consecrated by baptism to the service of Christ; and that to sin is therefore a violation of the very nature of our Christian profession.<p>Into - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis. This is the word which is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, "Teach all nations, baptizing them into &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis the name of the Father," etc. It means, being baptized unto his service; receiving him as the Saviour and guide, devoting all unto him and his cause.<p>Were baptized unto his death - We were baptized with special reference to his death. Our baptism had a strong resemblance to his death. By that he became insensible to the things of the world; by baptism we in like manner become dead to sin. Further, we are baptized with particular reference to the design of his death, the great leading feature and purpose of his work. That was, to expiate sin; to free people from its power; to make them pure. We have professed our devotion to the same cause; and have solemnly consecrated ourselves to the same design - to put a period to the dominion of iniquity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

And since He was "made sin" and "a curse for us" (2Co 5:21; Ga 5:13), "bearing our sins in His own body on the tree," and "rising again for our justification" (Ro 4:25; 1Pe 2:24), our whole sinful case and condition, thus taken up into His Person, has been brought to an end in His death. Whoso, then, has been baptized into Christ's death has formally surrendered the whole state and life of sin, as in Christ a dead thing. He has sealed himself to be not only "the righteousness of God in Him," but "a new creature"; and as he cannot be in Christ to the one effect and not to the other, for they are one thing, he has bidden farewell, by baptism into Christ's death, to his entire connection with sin. "How," then, "can he live any longer therein?" The two things are as contradictory in the fact as they are in the terms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Know ye not?</span> q.d.

This does not suppose, that some of this church were baptized persons, and others not; but that some might be baptized in water who were not baptized into Christ: there is a difference between being baptized in water in the name of Christ, and being baptized into Christ, which believers in their baptism are; by which is meant, not a being brought by it into union with Christ, which is either secretly from eternity, or openly at conversion, and both before the baptism of true believers; nor a being brought by it into the mystical body of Christ the church, for this also is before it; but rather it designs a being baptized, or a being brought by baptism into more communion with Christ, into a participation of his grace and benefits; or into the doctrine of Christ, and a more distinct knowledge of it: the power of which they feel upon their hearts, and so have really believed in Christ, heartily love him, and make a sincere profession of him; though rather the true meaning of the phrase "baptized into Christ", I take to be, is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an ordinance of his; it is to submit to it with a view to his glory, to testify our affection for him, and subjection to him, without laying any stress or dependence on it for salvation; such who are thus baptized, are "baptized into his death"; they not only resemble Christ in his sufferings and death, by being immersed in water, but they declare their faith in the death of Christ, and also share in the benefits of his death; such as peace, pardon, righteousness, and atonement: now this proves, that such persons are dead to sin, who are so baptized; for by the death of Christ, into which they are baptized, they are justified from sin; by the death of Christ, their old man is crucified, and the body of sin destroyed; besides, believers in baptism profess themselves to be dead to sin and the world, and their baptism is an obligation upon them to live unto righteousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</span><p>(3) There are three parts of this sanctification: that is, the death of the old man or sin, his burial, and the resurrection of the new man, descending into us from the virtue of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, of which benefit our baptism is a sign and pledge.<p>(c) To the end that growing up as one with him, we should receive his strength to extinguish sin in us, and to make us new men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἢ</span>] <span class="ital">or</span>, if this (<a href="/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid.

The mystic character of our passage is not produced by so vague a sensuous conception,—which moreover has all the passages against it in which <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζειν</span> is coupled with <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα</span> (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/acts/10-48.htm" title="And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

If this death thus becomes “<span class="ital">the end, once for all existent, of the relation of the world to God as determined by sin</span>” (Hofmann), that is the divinely willed <span class="ital">ethical result</span>, which faith obtains from the <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>, inasmuch as the believer realises his being dead to the power of sin with Christ, who in His expiatory death underwent the killing power of sin and therewith died to that power (vv. 9, 10). Comp. ver. 10 f.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a>. But this death to sin, on which the whole argument turns, raises a question. It is introduced here quite abruptly; there has been no mention of it hitherto. <span class="ital">When</span>, it may be asked, did this all-important death take place? The answer is: It is involved in baptism. <span class="greekheb">ἤ ἀγνοεῖτε ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: the only alternative to accepting this argument is to confess ignorance of the meaning of the rite in which they had been received into the Church. <span class="greekheb">ὄσοι ἐβαπτίσθημεν</span>: we all, who were baptised into Christ Jesus, were baptised into His death. The <span class="greekheb">ὅσοι</span> is not partitive but distributive: there is no argument in the passage at all, unless all Christians were baptised. The expression <span class="greekheb">βαπτισθῆναι εἰς Χριστὸν</span> does not necessarily mean to be baptised into Christ; it may only mean to be baptised Christward, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, with Christ in view as the object of faith. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>, and the expression <span class="greekheb">βαπτισθῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ</span>. In the same way <span class="greekheb">βαπτισθῆναι εἰς τὸν θάνατον αὐτοῦ</span> might certainly mean to be baptised with Christ’s death in view as the object of faith. This is the interpretation of Lipsius. But it falls short of the argumentative requirements of the passage, which demand the idea of an actual union to, or incorporation in, Christ. This is more than Lipsius means, but it does not exclude what he means. The baptism in which we are united to Christ and to His death is one in which we confess our faith, looking to Him and His death. To say that faith justifies but baptism regenerates, breaking the Christian life into two unrelated pieces, as Weiss does—one spiritual and the other magical—is to throw away the Apostle’s case. His whole point is that no such division <span class="ital">can</span> be made. Unless there is a <span class="ital">necessary</span> connection between justification by faith and the new life, Paul fails to prove that faith establishes the law. The real argument which unites chaps. 3, 4 and 5 to chaps. 6, 7 and 8, and repels the charge of antinomianism, is this: justifying faith, looking to Christ and His death, really unites us to Him who died and rose again, as the symbolism of baptism shows to every Christian.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">so many of us</span>, &c.] Not implying that some were, and some were not.

He refers the converts to their baptism as to the great crisis of their lives, when, having already, by Divine grace, “turned from idols to serve the living God,” they made (so to speak) their formal self-surrender to their Redeemer, and received His formal acceptance of them as His own.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into Jesus Christ</span>] i.e. so as to belong to Him, to obey Him, and to learn of Him.

Col.), at the beginning of which he calls himself an apostle, mentions <span class="ital">Baptism</span> expressly; in the more familiar (Phil.

But cf. <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, where the same expression occurs, and where <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span> appears only to imply a question. The expression <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;</span> also in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; in the first of these texts with reference to the Israelites and Moses. It denotes the entering by baptism into close union with a person, coming to belong to him, so as to be in a sense identified with him. In <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a> being <span class="accented">baptized</span> into Christ is understood as implying <span class="accented">putting him on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, were understood to imply the same idea, though not so plainly expressing it. Thus St. Paul rejoiced that he had not himself baptized many at Corinth, lest it might have been said that he had baptized them into his own name (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into such connection with himself as baptism implied with Christ alone. Doubtless in the instruction which preceded baptism this significance of the sacrament would be explained. And if "into Christ," then "into his death." "In Christum, inquam, totum, adeoque in mortem ejus baptizatur" (Bengel). The whole experience of Christ was understood to have its counterpart in those who were baptized into him; in them was understood a death to sin, corresponding to his actual death. This, too, would form part of the instruction of catechumens. St. Paul often presses it as what he conceives to be well understood; and in subsequent verses of this chapter he further explains what he means. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Know ye not (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The expression is stronger: are ye ignorant.

The convert said: "Soon I shall be dead, and they will bury me in my field. My flocks will come to pasture above me. But I shall no longer hear them, and I shall not come forth from my tomb to take them and carry them with me to the sepulchre. They will be strange to me, as I to them.
