It is a strong and beautiful expression for that entire depravity and corruption which, by nature, spreads itself over the whole man, leaving no part uninfected. This in a believer is <span class="ital">crucified with Christ, </span>mortified, gradually killed by virtue of union with him; the remembrance and consideration of his cross co- operating in the most powerful manner, with all the other motives which the gospel suggests, to destroy our corrupt passions, and former sinful habits, and inspire us with an utter aversion to and detestation of them: <span class="ital">that the body of sin </span>— The body belonging to sin, including sinful tempers, words, and works.

Corrupt passions and evil actions are the <span class="ital">members </span>of the old man, <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>. <span class="ital">Might be destroyed </span>— Utterly and for ever; <span class="ital">that henceforth we should not serve sin </span>— Should be no longer under its power, as we were before we became savingly acquainted with Christ and his gospel. <span class="ital">For he that is dead </span>— With Christ; <span class="ital">is freed from sin </span>— From the guilt of past, and the power of present sin, as dead men from the commands of their former masters.

The word as here used implies, that a sense of justification by the cross of Christ is the great means of our delivery from the bondage of sin, as it animates and exercises us to shake off its yoke, and is accompanied with the Spirit of adoption and regeneration, the fruit of which is always <span class="ital">liberty, </span><a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if we have been planted together - The word used here &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  sumphutos, does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It properly means sown or planted at the same time; what sprouts or springs up together; and is applied to plants and trees that are planted at the same time, and that sprout and grow together. Thus, the name would be given to a field of grain that was sown at the same time, and where the grain sprung up and grew simultaneously. Hence, it means intimately connected, or joined together. And here it denotes that Christians and the Saviour have been united intimately in regard to death; as he died and was laid in the grave, so have they by profession died to sin. And it is therefore natural to expect, that, like grain sown at the same time, they should grow up in a similar manner, and resemble each other.<p>We shall be also - We shall be also fellow-plants; that is, we shall resemble him in regard to the resurrection. As he rose from the grave, so shall we rise from sin. As he lived a new life, being raised up, so shall we live a new life. The propriety of this figure is drawn from the doctrine often referred to in the New Testament, of a union between Christ and his people. See this explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-10</a>. The sentiment here inferred is but an illustration of what was said by the Saviour <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>, "Because I live, ye shall live also." There is perhaps not to be found a more beautiful illustration than that employed here by the apostle of seed sown together in the earth, sprouting together, growing together, and ripening together for the harvest. Thus, the Saviour and his people are united together in his death, start up to life together in his resurrection, and are preparing together for the same harvest of glory in the heavens.<p>In the likeness of his resurrection - This does not mean that we shall resemble him when we are raised up at the last day - which may be, however, true - but that our rising from sin will resemble his resurrection from the grave. As he rose from the tomb and lived, so shall we rise from sin and live a new life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. For if we have been planted together&#8212;literally, "have become formed together." (The word is used here only).<p>in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection&#8212;that is, "Since Christ's death and resurrection are inseparable in their efficacy, union with Him in the one carries with it participation in the other, for privilege and for duty alike." The future tense is used of participation in His resurrection, because this is but partially realized in the present state. (See on [2203]Ro 5:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He prosecutes what he had before propounded, and illustrates it by an apt similitude, which is taken from grafting or planting. He takes it for granted, that believers are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">planted together in the likeness of</span> Christ’s <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">death, </span> i.e. are made conformable to him in his death: see <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a></span>. Christ died, and believers die; the one a natural, the other a spiritual death: the one by way of expiation, suffering, and satisfying for the sins of others; the other by way of mortification, killing and crucifying their own sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</span> in the original the sentence is elliptical and imperfect, the words running thus, <span class="ital">we shall be of his resurrection; </span> our translation therefore fills up the sense with a word borrowed from the preceding clause. See the like, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a></span>, <span class="ital">I have a greater witness than of John, </span> i.e. than that witness of John. The sense of the whole is this, That believers are not only dead, but risen with Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a></span>. They partake of such a resurection as resembles his; as Christ arose from the dead to a new life, so we rise from dead works to <span class="ital">walk in newness of life, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a></span>. Moreover, they are raised and quickened by a power and virtue that flows from Christ and his resurrection: this is that virtue which the apostle Paul so earnestly desired to be made a partaker of, <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a></span>. The graft revives with the stock in the spring, and that by a virtue which it receives from the stock; so as a believer is raised to newness of life, by virtue flowing from Christ, into whom he is ingrafted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Question.</span> Why doth he say believers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall be</span> planted, &c.?

So the Authorized Version. But the English word "planted" (though the idea expressed by it has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, and other ancient Fathers; also of the Vulgate, and, among moderns, Beza, Luther, and others; while some, including Erasmus, Calvin, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, understand "engrafted") probably suggests what was not intended. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>), and need only express being made to grow together in close association. In classic authors it commonly means <span class="accented">innate.</span> It seems here used, not to introduce a new figure, whether of planting or grafting, but only to express the close union with Christ, already intimated, into which we entered in baptism. The Revised Version has "have become united with him," which may perhaps sufficiently express what is meant, though hardly a satisfactory rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Tyndale and Cranmer translate "graft in deeth lyke unto him;" and perhaps "graft into" may be as good a rendering as any other. Meyer, Tholuck, Alford, and others take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (Tholuck). But it may be better to understand <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: "Graft into Christ, in the likeness of his death," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being added because Christ's death and ours, in the senses intended, are not the same kind of death literally, ours only corresponding to, and in a certain sense like his. The main purpose of this verse, as of ver. 4, is to press <span class="accented">resurrection</span> with Christ as following <span class="accented">death</span> with him. But why here the <span class="accented">future</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>? Did we not rise with Christ to a new life when we emerged from our baptismal burial? Future verbs are used also with a similar reference in ver. 8 and ver. 14. Now, there are three senses in which our resurrection with Christ may be understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As above (cf. <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, etc., where the expression is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our realization of our position of power and obligation in subsequent life - actually in practice "dying from sin and rising again unto righteousness" (cf. below, vers. 12-14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The resurrection of the dead hereafter. Some (including Tertullian, Chrysostom, (Ecumenins) have taken sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to be here intended; but, though the words themselves, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8, suggest this sense, it can hardly be intended here, at any rate exclusively or prominently, since the drift of the whole passage is to insist on the necessity of an <span class="accented">ethical</span> resurrection now; and it is evident that the clause before us corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in the previous verse, and to ver. 11, <span class="accented">et seq</span>. The future <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is understood by some as only expressing <span class="accented">consequence -</span> a necessary conclusion from a premiss, thus: If such a thing is the case, such other thing will follow. If so, sense (1) might still be understood; so that the idea would be the same as in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, etc., viz. that of our rising in baptism itself to a new life with Christ, in which sin need not, and ought not to, have dominion. But still the repeated use of the future tense (especially <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 14), together with the whole drift of what follows, seems rather to imply sense (2); that is, our realization of our position in our actual lives subsequent to baptism. If it be objected that in this case we should expect "we ought to be" rather than "we shall be" it may be replied that it is what God will do for us, rather than what we shall do for ourselves, that the apostle has in view. If he has made us partakers in the atoning <span class="accented">death</span> of Christ, having forgiven us all trespasses, etc. (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>), he will also make us partakers, as our life goes on, in the power of his <span class="accented">resurrection too</span>, delivering us from sin's dominion. Further, if this be so, the thought may also include sense (3) For elsewhere the future resurrection seems to be regarded as only the consummation of a spiritual resurrection which is begun in the present life, Christians being already partakers in the eternal life of God, of which the issue is immortality; cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3, 4</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; also our Lord's own words, which are peculiarly significant in this regard, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, <span class="accented">hath</span> everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is <span class="accented">passed from death unto life.</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you. The hour is coming, <span class="accented">and now is</span>, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live" (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24, 25</a>). Again, "I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me <span class="accented">shall never die'</span> (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We have been planted together (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev. gives more accurately the meaning of both words. &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; is not planted, which would be formed from &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; to plant, while this word is compounded with &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd; together, and &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; to grow. &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; is have become, denoting process, instead of the simple &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to be.
