Sinners are but ploughing iniquity, sowing vanity, and reaping the same. Shame came into the world with sin, and is still the certain effect of it. The end of sin is death. Though the way may seem pleasant and inviting, yet it will be bitterness in the latter end. From this condemnation the believer is set at liberty, when made free from sin. If the fruit is unto holiness, if there is an active principle of true and growing grace, the end will be everlasting life; a very happy end! Though the way is up-hill, though it is narrow, thorny, and beset, yet everlasting life at the end of it is sure. The gift of God is eternal life. And this gift is through Jesus Christ our Lord. Christ purchased it, prepared it, prepares us for it, preserves us to it; he is the All in all in our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now - Under the Christian plan of justification.<p>Being made free from sin - Being delivered from its dominion, and from bondage; in the same manner as before conversion they were free from righteousness, <a href="/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20</a>.<p>Ye have your fruit unto holiness - The fruit or result is holiness. This service produces holiness, as the other did sin. It is implied here, though not expressly affirmed, that in this service which leads to holiness, they received important benefits, as in the service of sin they had experienced many evils.<p>And the end - The final result - the ultimate consequence will be. At present this service produces holiness; hereafter it will terminate in everlasting life. By this consideration the apostle states the tendency of the plan of justification, and urges on them the duty of striving after holiness.<p>Everlasting life - Note, <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>. This stands in contrast with the word "death" in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>, and shows its meaning. "One is just as long in duration as the other;" and if the one is limited, the other is. If those who obey shall be blessed with life forever, those who disobey will be cursed with death forever. Never was there an antithesis more manifest and more clear. And there could not be a stronger proof that the word "death" in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>, refers not to temporal death, but to eternal punishment. For what force would there be in the argument on the supposition that temporal death only is meant? The argument would stand thus: "The end of those sins is to produce temporal death; the end of holiness is to produce eternal life!" Will not temporal death be inflicted, it would be immediately asked, at any rate? Are Christians exempt from it? And do not people suffer this, whether they become Christians or not? How then could this be an argument bearing on the tenor of the apostle's reasoning? But admit the fair and obvious construction of the passage to be the true one, and it becomes plain. They were pursuing a course tending to everlasting ruin; they are now in a path that shall terminate in eternal life. By this weighty consideration, therefore, they are urged to be holy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

In what sense regenerate persons are free from sin, and are become the servants of God, has been observed already; the consequence of which is, that such have their <p>fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life: holiness is a fruit of freedom from the bondage of sin, and of serving God; holiness begun in regeneration, calling, and conversion, is a fruit of the Spirit; a course of living righteously is a fruit of holiness, as a principle implanted; a gradual increase in holiness is carried on by the Spirit of God in a course of righteousness; and a course of righteousness, from a principle of grace, issues in perfect holiness; "without which no man shall see the Lord" <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>: here it seems to design, that holiness is fruit, or that which is gain and profit to persons, in opposition to sin, in which there is no profit: it is not indeed profitable to God in point of merit; yet holiness, as a principle of grace, is profitable to the saints in point of meetness for glory; and holiness, as it denotes an external course of life, is useful and profitable on many accounts; hereby God is glorified, the doctrine of Christ is adorned, religion is honoured and recommended, our own credit, reputation, and peace, are preserved, and our neighbour's good promoted. <p>And the end is everlasting life: as sin issues, if grace prevent not, in everlasting death; holiness issues in eternal life, not by way of merit, but of free gift. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">now</span>] i.e. <span class="bld">as things are</span>, by Divine mercy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to God</span>] The real Master of the justified.
