The establishment of the Roman Christians was to take place through those appointed ways and means that are laid down in the gospel, and form the main topic of Christian preaching. All means of grace centre in Christ, and it is only in accordance with the due proclamation of Him that the Christian can hope to become confirmed and strengthened.<p><span class= "bld">According to the revelation.</span>—An involved and difficult sentence. The two clauses which began with “according to” are co-ordinate together, and are both dependent upon the word “stablish” above. “May God establish and confirm you in all those ways that the gospel of Christ lays down; that gospel the introduction of which it has been reserved for these latter days to see; a secret long hidden, but now revealed, and corroborated as it is by the prophetic writings, and preached by the Apostles at God’s express command; the great instrument of bringing over the Gentiles to the faith.”<p><span class= "bld">Of the mystery.</span>—The word “mystery” is used elsewhere in the New Testament precisely in the sense which is so clearly defined in this passage of something which up to the time of the Apostles had remained secret, but had then been made known by divine intervention. The “mystery” thus revealed is the same as that described in the two preceding clauses—in one word, Christianity. All through the Old Testament dispensation, the Christian scheme, which was then future, had remained hidden; now, with Christ’s coming, the veil has been taken away.<p><span class= "bld">Since the world began.</span>—The English phrase here is paraphrastic. Literally, the Greek is <span class= "ital">in eternal times</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from this present moment, stretching backwards throughout eternity—an emphatic way of saying, “never before.” “The Old Testament is the hand of a clock, proceeding silently round the dial—the New Testament is the striking of the hour” (Bengel).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:21-24 The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, known to the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness and usefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and it were to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in the church, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gaius mine host - Who has received me into his house, and shown me hospitality. The word "host" means one who entertains another at his own house without reward.<p>And of the whole church - Who has opened his house to entertain "all" Christians; or to show hospitality to them all. He was baptized by Paul himself at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1.htm">1 Corinthians 1</a> <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a>; and was so highly esteemed by the church that John wrote an epistle to him; <a href="/3_john/1-1.htm">3 John 1:1</a>. He was probably a wealthy citizen of Corinth, who freely opened his house to entertain Christians, and for the purpose of religious worship.<p>Erastus - Erastus is mentioned <a href="/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> as having been sent by Paul with Timothy into Macedonia. He is also mentioned <a href="/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a> as having resided at Corinth.<p>The chamberlain - A chamberlain is properly an officer who has charge of a chamber, or of chambers. In England, the lord chamberlain is the sixth officer of the crown, and has charge of the king's lodgings, and wardrobe, etc. He has also an important rank on days of public solemnities, as the coronation day, etc. The word used here is commonly in the New Testament translated "steward." It properly means one who has charge of domestic affairs, to provide for a family, to pay the servants, etc. In this place it means one who presided over the pecuniary affairs of the "city," and should have been translated "the treasurer; the city treasurer;" an once of trust and of some importance, showing that, "all" who were converted at Corinth were not of the lowest rank. This is implied in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>, "Not many wise men, not many mighty, not many noble, are called," implying that there were some such.<p>Quartus a brother - A fellow-Christian. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.
