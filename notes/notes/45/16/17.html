The word <span class="greekheb">σκοπειν</span>, rendered <span class="ital">to mark, </span>signifies, to observe attentively and diligently, as those do who are placed on a watch-tower to observe the motions of their enemies. <span class="ital">Who cause divisions </span>— Or, <span class="ital">separations, </span>as <span class="greekheb">διχοστασιας </span>signifies, namely, by their false doctrine; <span class="ital">and offences </span>— <span class="greekheb">Τα σκανδαλα</span>, <span class="ital">stumbling-blocks, </span>or occasions of falling, by their factious spirit and scandalous conduct. Dr. Hammond thinks the apostle refers to the Gnostics, to whom indeed the characters, given in the next verse, of those here meant, do well agree. It is more probable, however, as Theodoret says, that he intends, <span class="greekheb">τους κακους του νομου συνηγορους</span>, <span class="ital">the wicked advocates of the law, </span>namely, those who preached up circumcision, and the observation of the ceremonies of the law, as necessary to the salvation of the Gentiles: and Chrysostom, Œcumenius, and Theophylact, agree with Theodoret in this opinion. And it is certain that these men caused divisions and separations from others, as unclean and not fit to be conversed with, <a href="/acts/11-3.htm" title="Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them.">Acts 11:3</a>; <a href="/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>; <a href="/context/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision....">Galatians 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a> : and set up separate assemblies for the worship of God, (see <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>,) on pretence of greater orthodoxy and sanctity than others, and who would admit none into their communion but such as joined them in their peculiarities, and who represented all others as erroneous and impious. <span class="ital">Contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned </span>— Of us, the apostles of Jesus Christ, or from me in this epistle. Many of the Roman brethren, probably, had heard the apostles and other inspired men in Judea and elsewhere, from whom they had learned the genuine doctrines of the gospel. Estius justly observes here, that the apostle intimates that even the common people, by the help of general principles, might discern the true doctrine, even that which was delivered by the apostles, from that which was false and not so delivered. But this could only then be done by comparing that which was declared by the apostles, and confirmed by their miracles, with that which was delivered as different from, or in opposition to it, and was not so confirmed. And this can only now be done by private Christians in general, by comparing all pretenders to the apostle’s doctrine, with those Scriptures which they wrote, under the influence of the Holy Ghost. <span class="ital">And avoid them — </span>Avoid all unnecessary intercourse with them. “It is worthy of notice,” says Macknight here, “that the apostle desires the faithful to mark them who caused divisions, not for the purpose of disputing with them, and far less for the purpose of apprehending and punishing them with fines, imprisonment, torture, and death; but that they might avoid their company, lest, by conversing familiarly with such, they should be infected with their errors and vices. For, as the apostle told Timothy, <a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2 Timothy 2:17</a>, <span class="ital">their word eats as doth a canker, </span>or gangrene.” <span class="ital">For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus; </span>they have not his glory in view, whatever they may pretend: <span class="ital">but their own belly </span>— Their chief aim and design is to advance their secular interests, and gratify their carnal desires. <span class="ital">And by good words </span>— <span class="greekheb">Χρηστολογιας</span>, <span class="ital">by speaking kindly, </span>or by plausible discourse, <span class="ital">and fair speeches </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ευλογιας</span>, <span class="ital">by blessings; </span>by praying for, or pronouncing blessings upon their disciples, or by praising and flattering them; <span class="ital">deceive the hearts of the simple </span>— <span class="greekheb">Των ακακων</span>, <span class="ital">of the harmless, </span>who, doing no ill themselves, are not upon their guard against them that do. The word denotes persons free from guile, upright and unsuspicious; but who have not discernment or prudence sufficient to enable them to see and avoid the snares which the wicked lay in their way.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:17-20 How earnest, how endearing are these exhortations! Whatever differs from the sound doctrine of the Scriptures, opens a door to divisions and offences. If truth be forsaken, unity and peace will not last long. Many call Christ, Master and Lord, who are far from serving him. But they serve their carnal, sensual, worldly interests. They corrupt the head by deceiving the heart; perverting the judgments by winding themselves into the affections. We have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. It has been the common policy of seducers to set upon those who are softened by convictions. A pliable temper is good when under good guidance, otherwise it may be easily led astray. Be so wise as not to be deceived, yet so simple as not to be deceivers. The blessing the apostle expects from God, is victory over Satan. This includes all designs and devices of Satan against souls, to defile, disturb, and destroy them; all his attempts to keep us from the peace of heaven here, and the possession of heaven hereafter. When Satan seems to prevail, and we are ready to give up all as lost, then will the God of peace interpose in our behalf. Hold out therefore, faith and patience, yet a little while. If the grace of Christ be with us, who can prevail against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I beseech you - One great object of this Epistle had been to promote "peace" between the Jewish and Gentile converts. So much did this subject press upon the mind of the apostle, that he seems unwilling so leave it. He returns to it again and again; and even after the Epistle is apparently concluded, he returns to it, to give them a new charge on the subject.<p>Mark them - Observe attentively, cautiously, and faithfully <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; be on your guard against them. Ascertain "who are" the real causes of the divisions that spring up, and avoid them.<p>Which cause - Who make. Probably he refers here to "Jewish" teachers, or those who insisted strenuously on the observance of the rites of Moses, and who set up a claim for greater purity and orthodoxy than those possessed who received the Gentile converts as Christian brethren. The Jews were perpetually thus recalling the Christian converts to the Law of Moses; insisting on the observance of those rites; troubling the churches, and producing dissensions and strifes; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, <a href="/acts/15-24.htm">Acts 15:24</a>.<p>Divisions - Dissensions; parties; factions; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>. The very "attempt" to form such parties was evil, no matter what the pretence. They who attempt to form parties in the churches are commonly actuated by some evil or ambitious design.<p>And offences - Scandals; or that give occasion for others to fall into sin. These two things are different. The first means parties; the other denotes such a course of life as would lead others into sin. The "Jew" would form parties, on the pretence of superior holiness; the Gentiles, or some hold Gentile convert might deride the scrupulous feelings of the Jew, and might thus lead him into "sin" in regard to what his conscience really forbade; see <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>. These persons on both sides were to he avoided, and they were to refuse to follow them, and to cultivate the spirit of unity and peace.<p>Contrary to the doctrine - To the "teaching" which you have received in this Epistle and elsewhere; the teaching that these divisions should cease; that the Jewish ceremonies are not binding; that all should lay aside their causes of former difference, and be united in one family; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; 15.<p>And avoid them - Give them no countenance or approbation. Do not follow them; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-10.htm">2 John 1:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8-9</a>. That is, avoid them as "teachers;" do not follow them. It does not mean that they were to be treated harshly; but that they were to be avoided in their "instructions." They were to disregard all that they could say tending to produce alienation and strife; and resolve to cultivate the spirit of peace and union. This would be an admirable rule if always followed. Let people make "peace" their prime object; resolve to love all who "are" Christians, and it will be an infallible guage by which to measure the arguments of those who seek to promote alienations and contentions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned&#8212;"which ye learned."<p>and avoid them&#8212;The fomentors of "divisions" here referred to are probably those who were unfriendly to the truths taught in this epistle, while those who caused "offenses" were probably those referred to in Ro 14:15 as haughtily disregarding the prejudices of the weak. The direction as to both is, first, to "mark" such, lest the evil should be done ere it was fully discovered; and next, to "avoid" them (compare 2Th 3:6, 14), so as neither to bear any responsibility for their procedure, nor seem to give them the least countenance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He shuts up the Epistle with a seasonable admonition, which he reserved to the last, that it might be the better remembered: it is, to beware of those that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">cause divisions and offences.</span> By the former, some understand those that corrupt the doctrine of the church; by the latter, those that violate the discipline thereof: others refer <span class="ital">divisions</span> to faith, and <span class="ital">offences</span> to manners. There are that like neither of these distinctions, but, think he only cautions them against church dividers; and mentions scandal or offences as the effect or fruit of church divisions. He seems to aim more especially at those who, together with the Christian faith, did obtrude upon believers the ceremonies of the law, as necessary to salvation; of these he often complains as enemies to the gospel and cross of Christ: see <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7</a> <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>,18,19 Tit 1:10</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; </span> i.e. that you have learned from those that first taught you and converted you to Christ: q.d.

The first is, that they should be marked. The word signifies such a marking, as a watchman useth that standeth on a tower to descry enemies; he marketh diligently all comers, and giveth notice accordingly, for the safety of the place. The second is, that they should be avoided, or declined: the like counsel is given, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>,14 <a href="/context/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;...">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a> <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2 Timothy 3:5</a> <a href="/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a> <a href="/2_john/1-10.htm" title="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2Jo 1:10</a></span>. The sum is, the church should excommunicate them, and all sound Christians should turn away from them, and shun their society, that they may be ashamed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now I beseech you, brethren,.... The apostle being about to finish his epistle, and recollecting that he had not given this church any instructions about the false teachers, who had been the cause of all their differences and uneasiness, inserts them here; or he purposely put them in this place, amidst his salutations, that they might be taken the more notice of; and very pertinently, since nothing could more express his great affection and tender concern for them; and these instructions he delivers to them, not in an authoritative way, as he might, and sometimes did, but by way of entreaty, beseeching them, and with the kind and loving appellation of brethren, the more to engage them to attend to what he was about to say to them: <p>them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned. The men he would have taken notice of were such who divided them in their religious sentiments, introducing heterodox notions, contrary to the doctrine of the Scriptures, of Christ and his apostles, and which they had learned from them; such as justification by the works of the law, the observance of Jewish days, and abstinence from meats, enjoined by the ceremonial law, and that as necessary to salvation; to which some gave heed, and others not, and so were divided; whereas the doctrine of faith is but one, the Gospel is one uniform thing, all of a piece; and those that profess it ought to be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment: hence their minds were alienated from each other, and they began to despise and judge one another, yea, to go into factions and parties, being unwilling to receive and admit each other to communion; and thus by these men they were divided in sentiments, affection, and worship; and which must needs cause offence to the church and the godly members of it, as well as cause many so to be offended, as to stumble and fall from the doctrine of faith, and profession of it, and greatly stagger and distress weak believers, and bring a scandal on religion, and the name and ways of Christ among the world, as nothing does more so than the jars and discords among Christians: wherefore the apostle advises to "mark" such persons, look out for, narrowly watch, strictly observe, and diligently examine them: the metaphor is taken from watchmen, who look out from their watch tower, and observe who are coming, or pass by, and take up suspicious persons, and carefully inquire who they are, and what they are about, and whether friends or foes. So both ministers of the Gospel, and members of churches, should not be asleep, which is the opportunity false teachers take to sow the seeds of false doctrine, discord, and contention, but should watch, and be upon their guard, and look diligently, that none among them fail of, or fall from, the doctrine of grace, or any root of bitterness, error, or heresy as well as immorality, spring up, which may be troublesome, and defile others; they should observe, and take notice of such who are busy to spread false doctrine, should watch their motions, follow them closely, take them to an account, examine their principles according to the word of God; and if found to be contrary thereunto, note them as false teachers: <p>and avoid them; shun their ministry, drop attendance on it, depart far from them, have no private conversation with them, receive them not into their houses, nor bid them God speed; with such do not eat, have no communion with them at the Lord's table, withdraw from them as disorderly persons, who act contrary to the doctrine and order of the Gospel, and after proper admonition reject them from all fellowship with you. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</span><p>(2) As by describing by name those who were worthy of commendation he sufficiently declared whom they ought to hear and follow, so does he now point out to them whom they ought to take heed of, yet he does not name them, because it was not necessary.<p>(f) Watchfully and diligently, as though you should scout for your enemies in a watch tower.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.">Romans 16:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σκοπεῖν</span>] <span class="ital">to have in view</span>, in order, namely, to guard against; comp. <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span>, <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a>; but <span class="greekheb">σκοπεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">speculari</span>, is stronger, comp. also <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰς διχοστ</span>.] comp. <a href="/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-29.htm" title="Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time;">1Ma 3:29</a>; Dem. 423. 4; Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. i. p. 630 A; Dion.

A <span class="ital">warning</span>, added by way of supplement, <span class="ital">against the erroneous teachers</span> who were then at work. This very supplementary position given to the warning, as well as its brevity, hardly entering at all into the subject itself (comp. on the other hand, the detailed treatment in chap. 14 15 of a less important contrast), evinces that Paul is <span class="ital">not</span> here speaking, as Wieseler, following older interpreters, holds, against such <span class="ital">as already were actually making divisions in Rome</span>. He would have treated so dangerous an evil in the doctrinal connection of the epistle and at length, not in such a manner as to show that it only occurred to him at the close to add a warning word. Hence this is to be regarded as directed against an evil <span class="ital">possibly setting in</span>. Doubtless he was apprehensive from the manifold experience acquired by him, that, as elsewhere (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a> ff.; <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a> ff.; <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a> ff., <a href="/context/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:...">Php 3:18-19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:13</a> ff.), so also in Rome, <span class="ital">Jewish zealots for the law</span>[48] might arise and cause divisions in their controversy with Pauline Christianity. This occasioned his warning, from which his readers knew to what kind of persons it referred,—a warning, therefore, against <span class="ital">danger</span>, such as he gave subsequently to the Philippians also (Philippians 3), to whom the evil must have been all the nearer. Paul might, however, the more readily consider it enough to bring in this warning only supplementary and briefly, since in Rome the Gentile-Christian element was the preponderant one, and the mind of the church in general was so strongly in favour of the Pauline gospel (<a href="/context/romans/16-19.htm" title="For your obedience is come abroad to all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise to that which is good, and simple concerning evil....">Romans 16:19-20</a>; <a href="/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a>), that a permanent Judaistic influence was at present not yet to be apprehended. How, notwithstanding, an anti-Pauline doctrinal agitation took place later in Rome, see <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a> ff. Moreover, the <span class="ital">precautionary</span> destination of our passage, and that in presence of the greatness of the danger, is sufficient to make us understand its contents and expression as well as its isolated position at the close. At least there does not appear any necessity for setting it down as an original constituent portion of an epistle addressed to a church founded by Paul himself, namely, to the church of the Ephesians (Ewald, Lucht).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] The brief indications, vv. 17, 18, do not suggest philosophical <span class="ital">Gentile-Christians</span> (Hammond, Clericus), but (see on ver. 18) <span class="ital">Judaizers</span>, against whom Paul offers his warning. Hofmann prefers to abide by the <span class="ital">generality</span> of the warning, whether the troubles might be of Gentile origin or might arise from doctrines of Jewish legalism. But this view does not satisfy the concrete traits in vv. 17, 18, 20. See the correct interpretation already in Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia. The latter says: <span class="greekheb">λέγει δὲ περὶ τῶν ἀπὸ Ἰουδαίων</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἳ ἁπανταχόσε περιϊόντες τοὺς ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν πιστεύοντας τῆς νομικῆς ἔχεσθαι παρατηρήσεως πείθειν ἐπειρῶντο</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them....">Romans 16:17-20</a>. Warning against false teachers. This comes in very abruptly in the middle of the greetings, and as it stands has the character of an after-thought. The false teachers referred to are quite definitely described, but it is clear that they had not yet appeared in Rome, nor begun to work there. Paul is only warning the Roman Church against a danger which he has seen in other places. There is a very similar passage in <a href="/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a> f., which Lightfoot connects with this, arguing that the persons denounced are not Judaising teachers, but antinomian reactionists. It is easier to see grounds for this opinion in Philippians than here: but chap. <a href="/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?...">Romans 6:1-23</a> may be quoted in support of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17–20</span>.

It contains a brief but earnest warning against an evil which everywhere beset and encountered the Apostle—the bold or subtle efforts of perverted and perverting teachers, Christians in name. We may gather that this evil was only just beginning at Rome; otherwise more of the Epistle would be given to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bp Lightfoot, in his note on <a href="/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a>, gives good reason to think that the teachers specially in view here are not Judaizers, but their antipodes—Antinomians. “They (the persons in this passage) are described as … holding plausible language, (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>,) as professing to be wise beyond others, (<a href="/romans/16-19.htm" title="For your obedience is come abroad to all men.

They appear therefore to belong to the same party to which the passages <a href="/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?...">Romans 6:1-23</a>, <a href="/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a> to <a href="/romans/15-6.htm" title="That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 15:6</a>, of that Epistle [to the Romans] are chiefly addressed.”[48]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] We think, however, that the opinions refuted in ch. 6 are not identical with those corrected in cch. 14, 15. In the former case, St Paul makes no compromise; in the latter, as regards <span class="ital">abstract principle</span>, he almost identifies himself with those whom he reproves. In the present verse, accordingly, we take the Antinomians whom the Romans are to avoid to be Antinomians in the fullest sense; rejecters of the moral (as well as ceremonial) law <span class="ital">in all respects;</span> heretics, in fact, of the type afterwards developed in some forms of Gnosticism,—holding, probably, that the acts of the body were indifferent to the soul.
