It becomes Christians to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye receive her ... - That you acknowledge her as being in the Lord, or as being a servant of the Lord; that is, as a Christian; compare <a href="/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29</a>.<p>As becometh saints - As it is proper that Christians should treat their brethren.<p>She hath been a succourer of many - The word used here &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  prostatis, means properly "a patron, a help," and was applied by the Greeks to one who "presided" over an assembly; to one who became "a patron" of others; who aided or defended them in their cause; and especially to one who undertook to manage the cause of "strangers" and foreigners before the courts. It was, therefore, an honorable appellation. Applied to Phebe, it means probably that she had shown great kindness in various ways to the apostle, and to other Christians; probably by receiving them into her house; by administering to the sick, etc. Such persons have a claim on the respect and Christian attentions of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is one thing he recommends her to them for, that they would receive her in a kind and friendly manner into their houses, and into their hearts' love and affections; admit her to their private meetings, and into church fellowship with them, and that as one that was in the Lord, and belonged to him; and also in his name, and for his sake: <p>as becometh saints; that is, both that they would treat her with that humanity, courteousness, Christian affection, and respect, as became them who were saints by calling and profession; and that they would use her as being one of the saints, a godly, holy person, and as such an one ought to be used, by virtue of the communion of saints: <p>and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: what her business was at Rome is not known; whether it was only to visit the saints; or whether it was to have a cause tried in any court of judicature there; or whether she came upon worldly business, as Lydia of Thyatira was at Philippi to sell her purple, when the Apostle Paul was there, it matters not: whatever assistance they could give her, either by directing her where the saints lived; or by giving her proper counsel and advice; or helping her forward in her worldly affairs; or whatever she was concerned in, this is desired; and is another thing for which the apostle recommends her to them, adding this reason, <p>for she hath been a succourer of many; or "a patroness of many" of the saints in necessity and distress. The word that is here used,   is, as Harpocratian says (k) the name by which such were called by the Athenians,   , "that were over the sojourners", who had the care and direction of them. And such was this woman to the poor saints in Cenchrea, and the strangers that came thither; not as being in such an office by the order and appointment of the church, but what she cheerfully and voluntarily took up herself and performed at her own expense, otherwise there would not be so much in the character as to deserve such peculiar notice, nor she be so worthy of praise and commendation: moreover, the apostle observes, that he also partook of her succour and assistance, <p>and of myself also; which would hardly have been the case had she been one that had only the care of the poor sisters of the church, which was the office of the deaconess: but she being a rich generous woman, and the apostle having shared in her bounty, gratefully acknowledges it; and he the rather mentions it, as knowing it would the more endear her to the saints at Rome, who would take more notice of her for the respect she had shown to him. <p>(k) Lexic. decem Orator. p. 255. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That ye receive her in the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.</span><p>(a) For Christ's sake, which appropriately belongs to the Christians, for the heathen philosophers have a resemblance of the same virtues.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">in the Lord, as becometh saints</span>] With all the attention and delicacy due from Christians to a Christian woman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">assist her</span>] Lit.
