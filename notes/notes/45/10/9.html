When we speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving, and feeding upon him, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ offered in the word. Justification by faith in Christ is a plain doctrine. It is brought before the mind and heart of every one, thus leaving him without excuse for unbelief. If a man confessed faith in Jesus, as the Lord and Saviour of lost sinners, and really believed in his heart that God had raised him from the dead, thus showing that he had accepted the atonement, he should be saved by the righteousness of Christ, imputed to him through faith. But no faith is justifying which is not powerful in sanctifying the heart, and regulating all its affections by the love of Christ. We must devote and give up to God our souls and our bodies: our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in confessing with the mouth. The believer shall never have cause to repent his confident trust in the Lord Jesus. Of such faith no sinner shall be ashamed before God; and he ought to glory in it before men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That if thou shalt confess - The word here rendered "confess" &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  homologeo&#772; is often rendered "profess"; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, "Then will I profess to them, I never knew you;" <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="/titus/3-14.htm">Titus 3:14</a>; <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12-13</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-21.htm">1 Timothy 6:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, etc. It properly means to "speak what agrees with something which others speak or maintain." Thus, confession or profession expresses our "agreement or concord with what God holds to be true, and what he declares to be true." It denotes a public declaration or assent to that, here expressed by the words "with thy mouth." A profession of religion then denotes a public declaration of our agreement with what God has declared, and extends to all his declarations about our lost estate, our sin, and need of a Saviour; to his doctrines about his own nature, holiness, and law; about the Saviour and the Holy Spirit; about the necessity of a change of heart and holiness of life; and about the grave and the judgment; about heaven and hell. As the doctrine respecting a Redeemer is the main and leading doctrine, it is put here by way of eminence, as in fact involving all others; and publicly to express our assent to this, is to declare our agreement with God on all kindred truths.<p>With thy mouth - To profess a thing with the mouth is to speak of it; to declare it; to do it openly and publicly.<p>The Lord Jesus - Shalt openly acknowledge attachment to Jesus Christ. The meaning of it may be expressed by regarding the phrase "the Lord" as the predicate; or the thing to be confessed is, that he is Lord; compare <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>, "And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." Here it means to acknowledge him as Lord, that is, as having a right to rule over the soul.<p>Shalt believe in thy heart - Shalt sincerely and truly believe this, so that the external profession shall correspond with the real, internal feelings. Where this is not the case, it would be hypocrisy; where this is the case, there would be the highest sincerity, and this religion requires.<p>That God hath raised him - This fact, or article of Christian belief, is mentioned here because of its great importance, and its bearing on the Christian system. If this be true, then all is true. Then it is true that he came forth from God; that he died for sin; and that God approved and accepted his work. Then it is true that he ascended to heaven, and is exalted to dominion over the universe, and that he will return to judge the quick and the dead. For all this was professed and taught; and all this was regarded as depending on the truth of his having been raised from the dead; see <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-33</a>; <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-20</a>. To profess this doctrine was, therefore, virtually to profess all the truths of the Christian religion. No man could believe this who did not also believe all the truths dependent on it. Hence, the apostles regarded this doctrine as so important, and made it so prominent in their preaching. See the note at <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>.<p>Thou shalt be saved - From sin and hell. This is the doctrine of the gospel throughout; and all this shows that salvation by the gospel was easy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. That if thou shalt, &c.&#8212;So understanding the words, the apostle is here giving the language of the true method of justification; and this sense we prefer (with Calvin, Beza, Ferme, Locke, Jowett). But able interpreters render the words, "For," or "Because if thou shalt," &c. [Vulgate, Luther, De Wette, Stuart, Philippi, Alford, Revised Version]. In this case, these are the apostle's own remarks, confirming the foregoing statements as to the simplicity of the gospel method of salvation.<p>confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus&#8212;that is, probably, "If thou shalt confess Jesus [to be] the Lord," which is the proper manifestation or evidence of faith (Mt 10:32; 1Jo 4:15). This is put first merely to correspond with the foregoing quotation&#8212;"in thy mouth and in thine heart." So in 1Pe 1:10 the "calling of believers" is put before their "election," as that which is first "made sure," although in point of time it comes after it.<p>and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised&#8212;"that God raised"<p>him from the dead, &c.&#8212;(See on [2242]Ro 4:25). In Ro 10:10 the two things are placed in their natural order.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> q.d. There are but these two things, which the gospel principally requires in order to our salvation: the one is, the confession of Christ with our mouths, and that in spite of all persecution and danger, to own him for our Lord, and for our Jesus; and to declare, that we are and will be ruled and saved by him, and by him only. The other is, to believe in our hearts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that God hath raised him from the dead.</span> This article of the resurrection of Christ presupposeth all the rest, and fasteneth together, as by a link, all the antecedents and consequents of it; his ascension, session at the right hand of God, and intercession, which followed after. This article therefore, by a figure, is put for all the rest; and this is mentioned, because the death and passion of Christ had availed us nothing, unless he had risen again; for thereby he obtained a perfect victory over sin, death, and damnation, for all the elect.

The confession of the first part of the verse answers to the faith in the second; he who believes in his heart that God raised Christ from the dead can confess with his mouth (on that ground and in that sense) that Jesus is Lord. On the basis of such mutually interpreting faith and confession he is saved. This does not deprive the death of Christ of the significance which Paul ascribes to it elsewhere. Christ could not be raised unless He had first died, and when He is raised it is with the virtue of His sin-atoning death in Him. His exaltation is that of one who has borne our sins, and the sense of this gives passion to the love with which believers confess Him Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">that if thou shalt</span>, &c.] Here the contents of the “utterance” are given in more detail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">confess with thy mouth</span>] i.e., practically, “submit to and own Him as supreme for thee.” See, for the demand of such “confession,” <a href="/matthew/10-32.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="/luke/12-8.htm" title="Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:">Luke 12:8</a>.

Cp. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; where light is thrown on the deep reality and significance of the confession meant here.—St Paul here refers back to the “who shall ascend?” of <a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a> : Jesus, as Lord, is He “who is in Heaven,” (<a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>,) who came thence, and is the way thither.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that God hath raised him</span>, &c.] Cp. <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>; where the “bringing again of the Great Shepherd from the dead,” <span class="ital">by the Father</span>, is the full and final proof that the Father is the God of Peace; i.e. of Reconciliation, of Justification. See too above, <a href="/context/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;...">Romans 4:24-25</a>, <a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>; and <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>.—The belief in the Resurrection here is not merely historical belief, (which yet is indispensable to all other belief in it,) but “heart” belief; the perception and cordial embrace of what the Resurrection reveals and imports as to the Risen One and His work.—Here, obviously, the “who shall descend?” of <a href="/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a> is referred to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἀν</span>) <span class="ital">if</span> only—<span class="greekheb">ὁμολογήσῃς</span>, <span class="ital">thou shalt confess</span>) Confession in itself does not save; otherwise infants would not be saved: but only in as far as it includes faith.—<span class="greekheb">Κύριον</span>, <span class="ital">the Lord</span>) The summary of faith and salvation is found in this appellation.
