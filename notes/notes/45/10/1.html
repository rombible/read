The strictness of the law showed men their need of salvation by grace, through faith. And the ceremonies shadowed forth Christ as fulfilling the righteousness, and bearing the curse of the law. So that even under the law, all who were justified before God, obtained that blessing by faith, whereby they were made partakers of the perfect righteousness of the promised Redeemer. The law is not destroyed, nor the intention of the Lawgiver disappointed; but full satisfaction being made by the death of Christ for our breach of the law, the end is gained. That is, Christ has fulfilled the whole law, therefore whoever believeth in him, is counted just before God, as much as though he had fulfilled the whole law himself. Sinners never could go on in vain fancies of their own righteousness, if they knew the justice of God as a Governor, or his righteousness as a Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Brethren - This expression seems intended particularly for the Jews, his ancient friends, fellow-worshippers, and kinsmen, but who had embraced the Christian faith. It is an expression of tenderness and affection, denoting his deep interest in their welfare.<p>My heart's desire - The word "desire" &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  eudokia means benevolence, and the expression, "my heart's desire," means my earnest and sincere wish.<p>Prayer to God - He not only cherished this feeling but he expressed in a desire to God. He had no desire that his kinsmen should be destroyed; no pleasure in the appalling doctrine which he had been defending. He still wished their welfare; and could still pray for them that they might return to God. Ministers have no pleasure in proclaiming the truth that people must be lost. Even when they declare the truths of the Bible that some will be lost; when they are constrained by the unbelief and wickedness of people to proclaim it of them, they still can sincerely say that they seek their salvation.<p>For Israel - For the Jewish nation.<p>That they might be saved - This clearly refers to salvation from the sin of unbelief; and the consequences of sin in hell. It does not refer to the temporal calamities which were coming upon them, but to preservation from the eternal anger of God; compare <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>. The reasons why the apostle commences this chapter in this tender manner are the following.<p>(1) because he had stated and defended one of the most offensive doctrines that could be preached to a Jew; and he was desirous to show them that it was not from any lack of affection for them, but that he was urged to it by the pressure of truth.<p>(2) he was regarded by them as an apostate. He had abandoned them when bearing their commission, and while on his way to execute their favorite purposes, and had preached the doctrine which they had sent him to destroy; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>. He had opposed them everywhere; had proclaimed their pride, self-righteousness, and crime in crucifying their Messiah; had forsaken all that they valued; their pomp of worship, their city, and their temple; and had gone to other lands to bear the message of mercy to the nations that they despised. He was willing to show them that this proceeded from no lack of affection for them, but that he still retained toward them the feelings of a Jew, and could give them credit for much that they valued themselves on, <a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>.<p>(3) he was aware of the deep and dreadful condemnation that was coming on them. In view of that he expressed his tender regard for their welfare, and his earnest prayer to God for their salvation. And we see here the proper feelings of a minister of the gospel when declaring the most terrible of the truths of the Bible. Paul was tender, affectionate, kind; convincing by cool argument, and not harshly denouncing; stating the appalling truth, and then pouring out his earnest desires to God that he would avert the impending doom. So should the awful doctrines of religion be preached by all the ambassadors of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Ro 10:1-21.

The apostle having suggested, that a few of the Jews only should be called and saved; that the far greater part should be rejected; that the Israelites who sought for righteousness did not attain it when the Gentiles did, but stumbled and fell at Christ, and would be ashamed and confounded; and knowing the prejudices of that people against him, therefore lest what he had said, or should say upon this subject, should be thought to arise from hatred and ill will to them, he judged it proper, as before, to express his trouble and sorrow on their account; so now his great love and affection to them, and which he signifies by calling them "brethren": for not the Roman believers are here addressed, as if he was telling them how much he loved his own nation; but either the Jews in general, whom he looked upon and loved as his brethren, according to the flesh; and whatever they thought of him, he considered them in such a relation to him, which obliged him to a concern for their good and welfare; or rather the believing Jews, that were members of the church at Rome, whom, besides using the common style of the Jewish nation, who were wont to call all of their country brethren, he could speak to, as being such in a spiritual relation, being children of the same father, partakers of the same grace and privileges, and heirs of the same glory. Now he declares to these persons, that the "desire of his heart" was towards Israel, he bore a good will to them, his mind was well disposed and affected towards them, he had a cordial, sincere, and hearty respect for them; and so far was he from being their enemy, that he continually bore them upon his mind at the throne of grace: and his <p>prayer to God for Israel was, that they might be saved; not only that they might be saved in a temporal sense, from these grievous calamities and sore judgments he saw were coming upon them, which he had reason to believe would issue in the destruction of them, as a nation and church; but that they might be spiritually converted, turned from their evil ways, and brought to believe in Christ, whom they had despised and rejected, and so be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: this he might desire not only from a natural affection for them, but as a minister of the Gospel, who cannot but wish that all that hear him might be converted and saved; and as a believer in Christ he might pray for this in submission to the will of God; and especially as he knew there was a seed, a remnant according to the election of grace, at that present time among them, that should be saved, though the larger number of them were cast off. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read "for them", instead of "for Israel"; not naming them, being easily understood; and so the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Brethren, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</span><p>(1) Purposing to set forth in the Jews an example of marvellous obstinacy, he uses this declaration.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀδελφοί</span>] Address to the readers, expressive of emotion.

The Apostle cannot enlarge on this melancholy situation without expressing once more the deep grief which it causes him. Since the Jews are referred to in the third person (<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν</span>) it is clear that the persons addressed are a Gentile Church. <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>: Paul’s heart seems drawn to his spiritual kindred as he feels the deep gulf which separates him meanwhile from his kinsmen according to the flesh. <span class="greekheb">ἡ μὲν εὐδοκία τῆς ἐμῆς καρδίας</span>: the meaning of <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκία</span> must be gathered from such examples as <a href="/matthew/11-26.htm" title="Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.">Matthew 11:26</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>. His heart’s <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκία</span> is that in which his heart could rest with complacency; that which would be a perfect satisfaction to it. This is virtually the same as “desire,” and an “Etymologicum ineditum” quoted in Schleusner explains it by <span class="greekheb">βούλημα</span>, <span class="greekheb">γνώμη</span>, <span class="greekheb">προαίρεσις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>.
