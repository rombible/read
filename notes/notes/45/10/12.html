The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there is no difference - In the previous verse Paul had quoted a passage from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, which says that "everyone" (Greek, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;  pas) that believeth shall not be ashamed; that is, everyone of every nation and kindred. This implies that it was not to be confined to the Jews. This thought he now further illustrates and confirms by expressly declaring that there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek. This doctrine it was one main design of the Epistle to establish, and it is fully proved in the course of the argument in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-4</a>. See particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26-30</a>. When the apostle says there is no difference between them, he means in regard to the subject under discussion. In many respects there might be a difference; but not in the way of justification before God. There all had sinned; all had failed of obeying the Law; and all must be justified in the same way, by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. The word "difference" &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;  diastole&#772; means "distinction, diversity." It also means "eminence, excellence, advantage." There is no eminence or advantage which the Jew has over the Greek in regard to justification before God.<p>The Jew - That portion of mankind which professed to yield obedience to the Law of Moses.<p>The Greek - Literally, those who dwelt in Greece, or those who spoke the Greek language. As the Jews, however, were acquainted chiefly with the Greeks, and knew little of other nations, the name Greek among them came to denote all who were not Jews; that is, the same as the Gentiles. The terms "Jew and Greek," therefore, include all mankind. There is no difference among people about the terms of salvation; they are the same to all. This truth is frequently taught. It was a most important doctrine, especially in a scheme of religion that was to be preached to all people. It was very offensive to the Jews, who had always regarded themselves as a especially favored people. Against this, all their prejudices were roused, as it completely overthrew all their own views of national eminence and pride, and admitted despised Gentiles to the same privileges with the long favored and chosen people of God. The apostles, therefore, were at great pains fully to establish it; see <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<p>For the same Lord over all ... - For there is the same Lord of all; that is, the Jews and Gentiles have one common Lord; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29-30</a>. The same God had formed them, and ruled them; and God now opened the same path to life. See this fully presented in Paul's address to the people of Athens, in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-30</a>; see also <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. As there was but one God; as all, Jews and Gentiles, were his creatures; as one law was applicable to all; as all had sinned; and as all were exposed to wrath; so it was reasonable that there should be the same way of return - through the mere mercy of God. Against this the Jew ought not to object; and in this he and the Greek should rejoice.<p>Is rich unto all - &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;  plouto&#772;n eis pantas. The word "rich" means to have abundance, to have in store much more than is needful for present or personal use. It is commonly applied to wealth. But applied to God, it means that he abounds in mercy or goodness toward others. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>, "God, who is rich in mercy," etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>, "charge them that are rich in this world ...that they be rich in good works." <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>, "God hath chosen the poor ...rich in faith;" that is, abounding in faith and good works, etc. Thus, God is said to be rich toward all, as he abounds in mercy and goodness toward them in the plan of salvation.<p>That call upon him - This expression means properly to supplicate, to invoke, as in prayer. As prayer constitutes no small part of religion; and as it is a distinguishing characteristic of those who are true Christians (<a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm">Acts 11:11</a>, "Behold he prayeth;") to call on the name of the Lord is put for religion itself, and is descriptive of acts of devotion toward God; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>, "And if ye call on the Father, etc.;" <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-14.htm">Acts 9:14</a>," he hath authority ...to bind all that call on thy name;" <a href="/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>; <a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>, "Then began men to call on the name of the Lord." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. For there is no difference&#8212;or "distinction"<p>between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord over all&#8212;that is, not God (as Calvin, Grotius, Olshausen, Hodge), but Christ, as will be seen, we think, by comparing Ro 10:9, 12, 13 and observing the apostle's usual style on such subjects. (So Chrysostom, Melville, Bengel, Meyer, De Wette, Fritzsche, Tholuck, Stuart, Alford, Philippi).<p>is rich&#8212;a favorite Pauline term to express the exuberance of that saving grace which is in Christ Jesus.<p>unto all that call upon him&#8212;This confirms the application of the preceding words to Christ; since to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus is a customary expression. (See Ac 7:59, 60; 9:14, 21; 22:16; 1Co 1:2; 2Ti 2:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:</span> he gives a reason for that universal term, <span class="ital">whosoever, </span> which he had added in the precedent verse, and is not found in Isaiah, as was noted before, in <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The same Lord over all; </span> these words are a reason why there is no difference now between Jew and Greek.

Some reasons are here assigned, confirming the apostle's sense of the prophet's words, that everyone that believes in Christ shall be saved; for there is no distinction of nations, no superiority on account of carnal descent, or fleshly privileges, no preeminence on the score of the laws and ordinances of the former dispensation, all which are now abolished; nor is there any difference in their state God-ward, all being under sin, and without a righteousness, and all standing in need of the righteousness of Christ, and salvation by him; to which is added another reason, <p>for the same Lord over all, or "is over all": by whom is meant, either God the Father, who is the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews, <a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>; or rather the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all; and is to be understood, not of his being so merely by creation, but redemption, he having bought with his blood all the elect of God, both among the Jews and among the Gentiles; so that he has the same equal propriety in one as another, and they the same claim to him, and the same encouragement to believe in him, for righteousness and life: and moreover, he <p>is rich unto all that call upon him; he is not only rich as God, being possessed of all divine perfections and glory, but as Mediator, having the riches of grace and glory in him; and is rich, beneficent, liberal and free in dispensing, pardoning, justifying, and sanctifying grace to all that come unto him, throw themselves at his feet, implore his grace and righteousness, and call upon him with faith and fervency. Such as these are here designed, and not all that make mention of his name, or are called by it; but who are the true worshippers of him in faith and fear; for the invocation of his name includes all worship of him, and exercise of grace upon him; hence this passage is no inconsiderable proof of his proper deity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a>.

It rests with Christ, so appealed to, to make a man partaker in the righteousness of God and eternal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">For there is no difference</span>] The same phrase (with precisely opposite reference) as <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>.—The “<span class="ital">for</span>” here refers to the “whosoever” of <a href="/romans/10-11.htm" title="For the scripture said, Whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 10:11</a>; and this refers to the truth, suggested through the whole passage here, of the “nearness” and freedom of salvation, which, as revealed in Christ, needed no advantage of Jewish privilege in order to reach it. <span class="ital">Belief</span> and <span class="ital">confession</span> were as “near” to Greek as to Jewish hearts and lips.—On “<span class="ital">Greek</span>” see note, <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the same Lord</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">for the same Lord is [Lord] of [them] all; abounding in wealth unto all</span>, &c.
