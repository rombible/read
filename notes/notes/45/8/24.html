It was by hope that he was saved. Hope, at the time when he first believed, made him realise his salvation, though it is still in the future. This is, indeed, implied in the very nature of hope. Its proper object is that which is future and unseen.<p><span class= "bld">By hope.</span>—It is usually faith rather than hope that is represented as the means or instrument of salvation. Nor can it quite rightly be said that hope is <span class= "ital">an aspect</span> of faith, because faith and hope are expressly distinguished and placed as co-ordinate with each other in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a> : “and now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three.” Hope is rather a secondary cause of salvation, because it sets salvation vividly before the believer, and so makes him strive to obtain it.<p>It must not, however, be overlooked that the phrase translated “by hope,” may be taken, rather to mean <span class= "ital">“with”</span> or <span class= "ital">“in</span> hope.” It will then serve to limit the idea of salvation. We were saved, indeed, in an inchoate and imperfect manner, but our full salvation is still a subject for hope, and therefore it is not past but still in the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?...">Romans 8:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we are saved by hope </span>— That is, our salvation is now only in hope; we do not yet possess the full salvation; <span class="ital">but hope that is seen is not hope </span>— Hope here, by a usual metonymy, is put for the object of hope; and in Scripture, <span class="ital">to see, </span>often signifies <span class="ital">to enjoy, </span>and sometimes to suffer.

Thus, if our hope of the heavenly inheritance, valuable beyond all we can express or conceive, be strong and lively, it will produce in us a patient waiting till God’s time be come to put us in possession of it, and in the mean while will render us willing to bear the intervening troubles contentedly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are saved by hope - It cannot be said that hope is the instrument or condition of salvation. Most commentators have understood this as meaning that we have as yet attained salvation only in hope; that we have arrived only to a condition in which we hope for future glory; and that we are in an attitude of waiting for the future state of adoption. But perhaps the word "saved" may mean here simply, we are kept, preserved, sustained in our trials, by hope. Our trials are so great that nothing but the prospect of future deliverance would uphold us; and the prospect is sufficient to enable us to bear them with patience. This is the proper meaning of the word "save"; and it is often thus used in the New Testament; see <a href="/matthew/8-25.htm">Matthew 8:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>; <a href="/mark/3-4.htm">Mark 3:4</a>; <a href="/mark/8-35.htm">Mark 8:35</a>. The Syriac renders this, "For by hope we live." The Arabic, "We are preserved by hope." Hope thus sustains the soul in the midst of trims, and enables it to bear them without a complaint.<p>But hope that is seen - Hope is a complex emotion, made up of an earnest desire, and an expectation of obtaining an object. It has reference, therefore, to what is at present unseen. But when the object is seen, and is in our possession, it cannot be said to be an object of hope. The Word hope here means the object of hope, the thing hoped for.<p>What a man seeth - The word "seeth" is used here in the sense of possessing, or enjoying. What a man already possesses, he cannot be said to hope for.<p>Why - How. What a man actually possesses, how can he look forward to it with anticipation? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

We who have received the firstfruits, who were in a lost perishing condition, and by nature no better than others, than the Gentiles, are saved by sin and wrath to come by Christ, with a spiritual and everlasting salvation. They were already saved in the preparations and purposes of God; in the covenant of grace; in the arms and hands of Christ, through his purchase; and as considered in him; and with respect to the inchoation and application of salvation, in effectual calling, and their right unto it by the righteousness of Christ; and with regard to the certainty of it, in faith and hope: the manner in which they are said to be saved, is "by", or "in hope"; not that hope is the cause of salvation, but the means by which souls are brought to the enjoyment of it; salvation, or glory, is the object of it: <p>but hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for? in the former clause, "hope" signifies the grace itself, but here the object of it; which is represented as unseen, not yet fully enjoyed, something future, and to be hoped for; as the resurrection of the dead, which is the object of hope, and is unseen, and even incredible to carnal reason, and is to come, and good foundation there is in divine revelation, to hope for it; and the hope of it is of great use to the saints, whilst in this world of trouble: eternal glory and happiness is also the object of the hope of believers; it is said to be the hope of their calling, which they are called by grace to; the hope of righteousness, which the righteousness of Christ is the ground and foundation of; and that blessed hope, the sum of their happiness; and hope laid up for them in heaven, where it is safe and secure; all which is unseen, and yet to come; but good reason there is to hope for it, since the Scriptures of truth so clearly express it; and the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, lay such a solid foundation for hope of it: the Alexandrian copy reads, "why doth he yet wait for?" and so the Ethiopic version, with which agrees the Syriac version, reading the whole, "for if we see it, why should we wait for it?" <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{23}</span> For we are saved by hope: but <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</span><p>(23) Sixthly, hope is necessarily joined with faith: seeing then that we believe those things which we are not yet in possession of, and hope does not refer to the thing that is present, we must therefore hope and patiently wait for that which we believe will come to pass.<p>(f) This is spoken by the figure of speech metonymy, that is, hope, which stands for that which is hoped for.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῇ γὰρ ἐλπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐσώθ</span>.] Ground of the <span class="greekheb">υἱοθεσίαν ἀπεκδ</span>., so far as the <span class="greekheb">υἱοθεσία</span> is still object of <span class="ital">expectation; for in hope we were made partakers of salvation</span>.

Incorrectly, because in general Paul specifically distinguishes faith and hope (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), while he always bases salvation only on faith, from which hope thereupon proceeds (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>); and here especially, as is shown by what follows, he brings into prominence the <span class="ital">definite</span> conception of <span class="ital">hope</span>, which as <span class="greekheb">δόξα μελλόντων</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>.

This sentence explains why Paul can speak of Christians as <span class="ital">waiting</span> for adoption, while they are nevertheless in the enjoyment of sonship. It is because salvation is essentially related to the future. “We wait for it: for we were saved <span class="ital">in hope</span>.” The dat <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐλπίδι</span> is that of mode or respect. Our salvation was qualified from the beginning by reference to a good yet to be. Weiss argues that the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐλπὶς</span> in the second clause (<span class="ital">res sperata</span>) makes it “absolutely necessary” to take it so in the first, and that this leaves no alternative but to make <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐλπίδι</span> <span class="ital">dat comm</span> and translate: “for, for this object of hope—eternal life and glory—were we delivered from eternal destruction”. But the “absolute necessity” is imaginary; a word with the nuances of <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span> in a mind with the speed of Paul’s need not be treated so rigorously, especially as the resulting construction is in itself extremely dubious. Hope, the Apostle argues, is an essential characteristic of our salvation; but hope turned sight is hope no more, for who hopes for what he sees? We do <span class="ital">not</span> see all the Gospel held out to us, but it is the object of our Christian hope nevertheless; it is as true and sure as the love of God which in Christ Jesus reconciled us to Himself and gave us the spirit of adoption, and therefore we wait for it in patience.

The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>, which has no preposition before it, seems here, to have a <span class="accented">modal</span> rather than <span class="accented">medial</span> sense; for faith, not hope, is that <span class="accented">whereby</span> we are ever said to be saved. The meaning is that when the state of salvation was entered upon, hope was an essential element in its appropriation. A condition, not of attainment, but of hope, is therefore the normal condition of the regenerate now; and so, after shortly pointing out the very meaning of hope, the apostle enforces his previous conclusion, that they must be content at present to wait with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it</span>. Now comes in a further thought, and a very interesting one. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By hope (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;)<p>Better in hope.
