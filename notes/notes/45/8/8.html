He means, they are not in a state of acceptance with God; nor do their ways, their tempers, words, and works, please him, whatever ceremonial precepts they may observe. An important and alarming declaration this, which it concerns all the professors of Christianity maturely to consider and lay to heart; and particularly those who content themselves with a form of godliness, without the power; with an attendance on outward ordinances, and the use of the external means of grace, and give themselves no concern either about the remission of their past sins, or the renovation of their sinful nature; but remain earthly and sensual in their desires, cares, and pursuits, or <span class="ital">carnally minded, </span>which <span class="ital">is death.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Believers may be chastened of the Lord, but will not be condemned with the world. By their union with Christ through faith, they are thus secured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these do we make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will is unable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outward duties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by the sufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might be pardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice, and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of the law. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after the Spirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure? Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for the world, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6. A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal man may, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God, but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. We may know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mind in some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to be shown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So then - It follows; it leads to this conclusion.<p>They that are in the flesh - They who are unrenewed sinners; who are following supremely the desires of the flesh; <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>.

But this affirms nothing respecting their ability to turn from this course, and to pursue a different mode of life. That is a different question. A child may be obstinate, proud, and disobedient; and while in this state, it may be affirmed of him that he cannot please his parent. But whether he might not cease to be obstinate, and become obedient, is a very different inquiry; and the two subjects should never be be confounded. It follows from this,<p>(1) That those who are unrenewed are totally depraved, since in this state they cannot please God.<p>(2) that none of their actions while in this state can be acceptable to him, since he is pleased only with those who are spiritually minded.<p>(3) that those who are in this state should turn from it without delay; as it is desirable that every man should please God.<p>(4) that if the sinner does not turn from his course, he will be ruined.<p>With his present character he can never please him; neither in health nor sickness; neither in life nor death; neither on earth nor in hell. He is engaged in hostility against God; and if he does not himself forsake it, it will be endless, and involve his soul in all the evils of a personal, and direct, and eternal warfare with the Lord Almighty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The difference in idea is that between a condition and the resulting action.—It is clear that “they that are in the flesh” means “all men before special grace.” For the only other condition of the soul contemplated by St Paul is the being “in the Spirit,” i.e. actuated and ruled by “the Holy Ghost given unto us.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cannot please God</span>] See <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a> for the bright contrast of the state of grace.—This ver. proves that “the mind of the flesh” is viewed by St Paul as the true, ruling, determining, “mind” of the unregenerate man. It is not only a dangerous element, but that which gives its quality to his whole attitude towards God. He “cannot” (a <span class="ital">moral</span> impossibility of course is meant) “please God;” he cannot make God his supreme choice, object, and rule; in short he cannot “love Him with all his mind;” and no other condition of the soul than this can, in the true sense of the word, “<span class="ital">please</span> God.” Particular acts, in themselves, He may approve; but not the real attitude of the doer’s soul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/8-8.htm" title="So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.">Romans 8:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δὲ</span>) is <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτατικόν</span>, [employed to give epitasis (endix): <span class="ital">i.e.</span> where to an enunciation already stated, there is added some word to give increased emphasis, or an explanation].—<span class="greekheb">ἀρέσαι</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἀρέσκω</span> here, as elsewhere, signifies not only <span class="ital">I please</span>, but <span class="ital">I am desirous</span> to please, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>; it is akin to the phrase, <span class="ital">to be subject</span>, in the preceding verse.</body></html>
