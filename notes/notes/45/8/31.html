Every providence tends to the spiritual good of those that love God; in breaking them off from sin, bringing them nearer to God, weaning them from the world, and fitting them for heaven. When the saints act out of character, corrections will be employed to bring them back again. And here is the order of the causes of our salvation, a golden chain, one which cannot be broken. 1. Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. All that God designed for glory and happiness as the end, he decreed to grace and holiness as the way. The whole human race deserved destruction; but for reasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover some by regeneration and the power of his grace. He predestinated, or before decreed, that they should be conformed to the image of his Son. In this life they are in part renewed, and walk in his steps. 2. Whom he did predestinate, them he also called. It is an effectual call, from self and earth to God, and Christ, and heaven, as our end; from sin and vanity to grace and holiness, as our way. This is the gospel call. The love of God, ruling in the hearts of those who once were enemies to him, proves that they have been called according to his purpose. 3. Whom he called, them he also justified. None are thus justified but those that are effectually called. Those who stand out against the gospel call, abide under guilt and wrath. 4. Whom he justified, them he also glorified. The power of corruption being broken in effectual calling, and the guilt of sin removed in justification, nothing can come between that soul and glory. This encourages our faith and hope; for, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect. The apostle speaks as one amazed, and swallowed up in admiration, wondering at the height and depth, and length and breadth, of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. The more we know of other things, the less we wonder; but the further we are led into gospel mysteries, the more we are affected by them. While God is for us, and we keep in his love, we may with holy boldness defy all the powers of darkness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall we then say ... - What fairly follows from the facts stated? or what conclusion shall we draw in regard to the power of the Christian religion to support us in our trials from the considerations which have been stated?

Either to these afflictions, shall we murmur and repine at them? no, since they work together for our good, and are not to be compared with our future glory, which is certain; for if we suffer with, and for Christ, we shall be glorified together: or to these blessings just now mentioned, as the foreknowledge of God, divine predestination, effectual calling, free justification, and eternal glorification, what can be said to these? nothing can be added to them, they are a complete set of blessings, wanting nothing; nor can the greatness of them be fully expressed, or the freeness of God's grace displayed in them, sufficiently declared: what remains for us to do, but to be thankful for them, and glory in them? or what can be said "against" them? nothing at all, they cannot be contradicted or gainsaid; they are true and faithful sayings; they can never be made void, and of no effect, by hell or earth; nor ought our unbelieving hearts to have anything to say against interest in them: or what is to be said, or inferred "from" them? why, the free, sovereign, unchangeable, and everlasting love of God, in providing and bestowing such benefits; and the certainty of salvation, which is infallibly secured hereby: <p>if God be for us; or, "seeing he is for us", has an affection for us, which appears from the gift of himself, Son, and Spirit, and all the blessings of grace and glory; and is on our side: as that he is on the side of his people, is evident from his preservation of them from the evils of the world and their own corruptions; from the supports he gives them under afflictions and temptations; from his carrying on the work of grace upon them, notwithstanding all the opposition made unto it; and from their safety and security they enjoy by him, notwithstanding the power of their enemies; he is so for them, and on their side, as that he will certainly save them. This he has determined to do, he has sent his Son to obtain salvation for them, his Spirit to apply it to them, and keeps them by his power to the full enjoyment of it: and since this is the case, <p>who can be against us? none can be against them. There are some that cannot possibly be against them; if Jehovah the Father is not against them, the Son cannot be against them, nor the Spirit; good angels cannot be against them, so far from it, that they rejoice at their good, minister to them, and are a guard about them; the law cannot be against them, because it is fulfilled in them; nor justice, because it is satisfied, and all its demands answered: and though there may be some who may be against them, and oppose themselves to them, yet their opposition is to no purpose; they will never prevail over them to their ruin and destruction; as neither sin, nor Satan, nor the world, nor death itself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{26}</span> What shall we then say to these things?

The first, a general section, is this: <span class="ital">If God be for us</span>, WHO <span class="ital">can be against us?</span> The first special section is this, which concerns the past: <span class="ital">He who did not even spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;</span> How <span class="ital">shall He not also with Him forgive</span> [But Engl. Vers. <span class="ital">freely give</span>] <span class="ital">us all things?</span> WHO <span class="ital">shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?</span> (Where in the question, the logical consequence is from [is drawn from] glorying concerning the past: for the nature of the subject did not admit of the section being only expressed by <span class="ital">preterite tenses</span>. Accordingly there is [besides the Preterites] also a double <span class="ital">future</span> in, <span class="ital">shall He forgive, shall lay to the charge;</span> but it has a manifest reference to <span class="ital">past events</span>. God will forgive all the sins, that have been committed [by believers]. No one can now accuse God’s elect on account of those sins committed by them. And the <span class="ital">how</span> and <span class="ital">who</span> are thus combined in one and the same section, but there is also a double relation, 1.) <span class="ital">God did not spare His own Son</span>. Therefore, <span class="ital">He will also forgive us with Him all things</span>. 2.) <span class="ital">He delivered Him up for us all</span>. Therefore, <span class="ital">no one shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect</span>.) The second section has respect to the present; <span class="ital">It is God that justifieth</span>, WHO <span class="ital">is he that condemneth;</span> comp. by all means, <a href="/context/isaiah/50-8.htm" title="He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me....">Isaiah 50:8-9</a>. The third section is concerning the future; <span class="ital">It is Christ</span> [that died], etc. WHO <span class="ital">shall separate us?</span> For it is a future non-separation which is implied in the <span class="ital">shall separate</span>, as appears by comparing this with the end of <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>. The Past and Present are the foundation of the Future, and often the love of Christ is inferred from His death, ch. <a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>, etc.; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a>. An interrogative apodosis such as this is frequent, and is admirably suited to a spirited discourse.—<a href="/acts/8-33.htm" title="In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.">Acts 8:33</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm" title="He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up?

Observe that the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> as in ver. 28.

Many may be <span class="accented">called</span> to a state of salvation, but not all of them <span class="accented">chosen</span> finally, as fulfilling the purpose of their calling.) It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. A different punctuation of these two verses is preferred by some, and seems more natural and more forcible; thus: Who <span class="accented">shall charge God's elect? God who justifieth? Who is he that condemneth? Christ who died?</span> etc. A similar answering a question by asking another is found below in ver. 35. The further thought is thus implied that, if neither God charges, nor Christ, the Judge, condemns, who can do either? The apostle next goes on to say that, there being none to charge and condemn us at last, so also there is none that can <span class="accented">remove</span> us from our state of acceptance now. For who or what can possibly prove stronger than Christ's love, which has called us to it? The enumeration that follows of things that might possibly be supposed to remove us shows again that it is not our own sins, but external circumstances of trial, that are being viewed all along as powerless to hinder our salvation. </body></html>
