The two phrases indicate two distinct steps. God, in His infinite foreknowledge, knew that certain persons would submit to be conformed to the image of His Son, and he predestined them for this.<p>When we argue deductively from the omniscience and omnipotence of God, human free-will seems to be obliterated. On the other hand, when we argue deductively from human free-will, the divine foreknowledge and power to determine action seem to be excluded. And yet both truths must be received without detriment to each other. We neither know strictly what God’s omnipotence and omniscience are (according to a more exact use of language, we ought to say, perhaps, “perfect power and knowledge”—power and knowledge such as would belong to what we are incapable of conceiving, a perfect Being), nor do we know what human free-will is in itself. It is a necessary postulate if there is to be any synthesis of human life at all; for without it there can be no distinction between good and bad at all. But we do not really know more than that it is that hypothetical faculty in man by virtue of which he is a responsible agent.<p><span class= "bld">To be conformed</span> . . .—The final cause of the whole of this divine process is that the Christian may be conformed to the image of Christ—that he may be like him not merely in spirit, but also in that glorified body, which is to be the copy of the Redeemer’s (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>), and so be a fit attendant upon Him in His Messianic kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Firstborn among many brethren.</span>—The Messianic kingdom is here conceived of rather as a family. In this family Christ has the rights of primogeniture, but all Christians are His brethren; and the object of His mission and of the great scheme of salvation (in all its stages—foreknowledge, calling, justification, &c.) is to make men <span class= "ital">sufficiently like Him to be</span> His brethren, and so to fill up the number of the Christian family. The word “firstborn” occurs in a similar connection in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>, “firstborn of every creature” (or rather, <span class= "ital">of all creation</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and in <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, “When he bringeth in the first-begotten (<span class= "ital">firstborn</span>) into the world.” It implies two things—(1) priority in point of time, or in other words the pre-existence of the Son as the Divine Word; and (2) supremacy or sovereignty as the Messiah. The Messianic use of the word is based upon <a href="/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>, “Also I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.”<p><span class= "bld">Among many brethren.</span>—Comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> “He is not ashamed to call them brethren,” &c. There is a stress on “many.” The object of the Christian scheme is that Christ may not stand alone in the isolated glory of His pre-existence, but that He may be surrounded by a numerous brotherhood fashioned after His likeness as He is in the likeness of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">For whom he did foreknow </span>— As truly repenting, believing, and obeying the gospel; <span class="ital">he also did predestinate, to be conformed to the image of his Son </span>— That is, it was his foreappointment, or predetermination, will, and pleasure, that <span class="ital">as Christ was, they should be in this world, </span><a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>, namely, <span class="ital">holy, harmless, undefiled, </span>and <span class="ital">separate from sinners, </span><a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; that they should have in them <span class="ital">the mind that was in him, </span>and should <span class="ital">walk as he walked. </span>But the word <span class="greekheb">προοριζω</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">prius definio, to define, </span>or <span class="ital">describe beforehand; </span>and may be understood of God’s foretelling, by the Old Testament prophets, that the disciples of the Messiah, when he came, should resemble him, and of their describing them as persons conformed to him.

Every providence tends to the spiritual good of those that love God; in breaking them off from sin, bringing them nearer to God, weaning them from the world, and fitting them for heaven. When the saints act out of character, corrections will be employed to bring them back again. And here is the order of the causes of our salvation, a golden chain, one which cannot be broken. 1. Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. All that God designed for glory and happiness as the end, he decreed to grace and holiness as the way. The whole human race deserved destruction; but for reasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover some by regeneration and the power of his grace. He predestinated, or before decreed, that they should be conformed to the image of his Son. In this life they are in part renewed, and walk in his steps. 2. Whom he did predestinate, them he also called. It is an effectual call, from self and earth to God, and Christ, and heaven, as our end; from sin and vanity to grace and holiness, as our way. This is the gospel call. The love of God, ruling in the hearts of those who once were enemies to him, proves that they have been called according to his purpose. 3. Whom he called, them he also justified. None are thus justified but those that are effectually called. Those who stand out against the gospel call, abide under guilt and wrath. 4. Whom he justified, them he also glorified. The power of corruption being broken in effectual calling, and the guilt of sin removed in justification, nothing can come between that soul and glory. This encourages our faith and hope; for, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect. The apostle speaks as one amazed, and swallowed up in admiration, wondering at the height and depth, and length and breadth, of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. The more we know of other things, the less we wonder; but the further we are led into gospel mysteries, the more we are affected by them. While God is for us, and we keep in his love, we may with holy boldness defy all the powers of darkness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For whom he did foreknow - The word used here &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  proegno&#772; has been the subject of almost endless disputes in regard to its meaning in this place. The literal meaning of the word cannot be a matter of dispute. It denotes properly to "know beforehand;" to be acquainted with future events. But whether it means here simply to know that certain persons would become Christians; or to ordain, and constitute them to be Christians, and to be saved, has been a subject of almost endless discussion. Without entering at large into an investigation of the word, perhaps the following remarks may throw light on it.<p>(1) it does not here have reference to all the human family; for all are not, and have not, been conformed to the image of his Son. It has reference therefore only to those who would become Christians, and be saved.<p>(2) it implies "certain knowledge." It was certainly foreseen, in some way, that they would believe, and be saved. There is nothing, therefore, in regard to them that is contingent, or subject to doubt in the divine Mind, since it was certainly foreknown.<p>(3) the event which was thus foreknown must have been, for some cause, certain and fixed; since an uncertain event could not be possibly foreknown. To talk of a foreknowing a contingent event, that is, of foreknowing an event as certain which may or may not exist, is an absurdity.<p>(4) in what way such an event became certain is not determined by the use of this word. But it must have been somehow in connection with a divine appointment or arrangement, since in no other way can it be conceived to be certain. While the word used here, therefore, does not of necessity mean to decree, yet its use supposes that there was a purpose or plan; and the phrase is an explanation of what the apostle had just said, that it was "according to the purpose of God" that they were called. This passage does not affirm why, or how, or, "on what grounds" God foreknew that some of the human family would be saved. It simply affirms the fact; and the mode in which those who will believe were designated, must be determined from other sources. This passage simply teaches that he knew them; that his eye was fixed on them; that he regarded them as to be conformed to his Son; and that, thus knowing them, he designated them to eternal life. The Syriac renders it in accordance with this interpretation: "And from the beginning he knew them, and sealed them with the image of his Son," etc. As, however, none would believe but by the influences of his Spirit, it follows that they were not foreknown on account of any faith which they would themselves exercise, or any goodworks which they would themselves perform, but according to the purpose or plan of God himself.<p>He also did predestinate - See the meaning of the original of this word explained in the notes at <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; see also the <a href="/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a> note; and <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> note. In these places the word evidently means to determine, purpose, or decree beforehand; and it must have this meaning here. No other idea could be consistent with the proper meaning of the word, or be intelligible. It is clear also that it does not refer to external privileges, but to real conversion and piety; since that to which they were predestinated was not the external privilege of the gospel, but conformity to his Son, and salvation; see <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>. No passage could possibly teach in stronger language that it was God's purpose to save those who will be saved. <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>, "having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself." <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."<p>To be conformed to the image of his Son - To resemble his Son; to be of like form with the image of his Son. We may learn here,<p>(1) That God does not determine to save people, whatever their character may be. The decree is not to save them in their sins, or whether they be sinful or holy. But it has primary respect to their char acter. It is that they "should be" holy; and, as a consequence of this, that they should be saved.<p>(2) the only evidence which we can have that we are the subjects of his gracious purpose is, that we are "in fact" conformed to the Lord Jesus Christ. For this was the design of the decree. This is the only satisfactory proof of piety; and by this alone can we determine that we are interested in his gracious plan of saving people.<p>That he might be the first-born - The first-born among the Hebrews had many special privileges. The idea here is,<p>(1) That Christ might be pre-eminent as the model and exemplar; that he might be clothed with special honors, and be so regarded in his church; and yet,<p>(2) That he might still sustain a fraternal relation to them; that he might be one in the same great family of God where all are sons; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-12.htm">Hebrews 2:12-14</a>.<p>Many brethren - Not a few. The purpose of God is that many of the human family shall be saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. For&#8212;as touching this "calling according to his purpose" (Ro 8:28).<p>whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate&#8212;foreordain. In what sense are we to take the word "foreknow" here? "Those who He foreknew would repent and believe," say Pelagians of every age and every hue. But this is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole spirit, and even letter, of the apostle's teaching (see Ro 9:11; 2Ti 1:9). In Ro 11:2, and Ps 1:6, God's "knowledge" of His people cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here below. Does "whom He did foreknow," then, mean "whom He foreordained?" Scarcely, because both "foreknowledge" and "foreordination" are here mentioned, and the one as the cause of the other. It is difficult indeed for our limited minds to distinguish them as states of the Divine Mind towards men; especially since in Ac 2:23 "the counsel" is put before "the foreknowledge of God," while in 1Pe 1:2 "election" is said to be "according to the foreknowledge of God." But probably God's foreknowledge of His own people means His "peculiar, gracious, complacency in them," while His "predestinating" or "foreordaining" them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to "save them and call them with an holy calling" (2Ti 1:9).<p>to be conformed to the image of his Son&#8212;that is, to be His sons after the pattern, model, or image of His Sonship in our nature.<p>that he might be the first-born among many brethren&#8212;"The First-born," the Son by nature; His "many brethren," sons by adoption: He, in the Humanity of the Only-begotten of the Father, bearing our sins on the accursed tree; they in that of mere men ready to perish by reason of sin, but redeemed by His blood from condemnation and wrath, and transformed into His likeness: He "the First-born from the dead"; they "that sleep in Jesus," to be in due time "brought with Him"; "The First-born," now "crowned with glory and honor"; His "many brethren," "when He shall appear, to be like Him, for they shall see Him as He is."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having let fall a word in the former verse concerning the <span class="ital">purpose</span> of God, he thinks good, in what follows, to pursue that subject, and a little to enlarge upon it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whom he did foreknow; </span> i.e. with a knowledge of approbation; for otherwise, he foreknew all persons and things: or, whom he did foreknow for his own, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>,27 Ro 11:2 <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his.

The foreknowledge of God here, does not intend his prescience of all things future; by which he foreknows and foretells things to come, and which distinguishes him from all other gods; and is so called, not with respect to himself, with whom all things are present, but with respect to us, and which is eternal, universal, certain, and infallible; for in this sense he foreknows all men, and if this was the meaning here, then all men would be predestinated, conformed to the image of Christ, called by grace, justified and glorified; whereas they are a special people, whom God has foreknown: nor is this foreknowledge to be understood of any provision or foresight of the good works, holiness, faith, and perseverance of men therein, upon which God predestinates them to happiness; since this would make something out of God, and not his good pleasure, the cause of predestination; which was done before, and without any consideration of good or evil, and is entirely owing to the free grace of God, and is the ground and foundation of good works, faith, holiness, and perseverance in them: but this regards the everlasting love of God to his own people, his delight in them, and approbation of them; in this sense he knew them, he foreknew them from everlasting, affectionately loved them, and took infinite delight and pleasure in them; and this is the foundation of their predestination and election, of their conformity to Christ, of their calling, justification, and glorification: for these <p>he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; having perfect, distinct, special knowledge of them, joined with love to them, he predetermined, or fore-appointed them in his eternal mind, in his everlasting and unchangeable purposes and decrees to this end, conformity to the image of Christ; which is not to be understood of the Spirit of Christ: God's elect indeed are chosen to be holy, and through sanctification of the Spirit, but are never said to be conformed, made like to the Spirit, nor is the Spirit ever called the image of Christ; but this designs either likeness to Christ as the Son of God, or conformity to him in his human nature. There is indeed a great disparity between the sonship of Christ, and of the saints; he is the eternal and natural Son of God, he is the one and only begotten Son, they are adopted ones, yet in some things there is a likeness; as he is the Son of God, so are they the sons of God, though not in the same sense; as he is a beloved Son, so are they; as he is the firstborn with respect them, they are the firstborn with respect to angels; as he has an inheritance, so have they; moreover, he has a very great concern in their sonship; the predestination of them to it is by him; the blessing itself is founded on union to him, on their conjugal relation to him, and his assumption of their nature; it comes to them through his redemption, and is actually bestowed on them by him; and this conformity to Christ as sons, will mere fully appear hereafter, when they shall be like him, and see him as he is: or this may be understood of the saints' conformity to Christ in his human nature, both here and hereafter: here in holiness; the image of God was in in his first creation, this is defaced by sin; and in regeneration, the image of Christ is stamped, his grace is wrought in them, his Spirit is put into them, to enable them to walk in him, and after him: this will be complete hereafter, and will consist in perfect holiness, being freed from the very being, as well as the power and guilt of sin; in perfect knowledge of everything that will tend to their happiness; and in glory like to Christ, both in soul and body: <p>that he might be the firstborn among many brethren; the persons among whom Christ is the firstborn are described by their relation, "brethren"; to one another, being related to the same Father, regenerated by the same grace, taken into the same family, and heirs of the same glory; and to Christ, which relation, as brethren to him, is not merely founded on his incarnation, but in their adoption; and which is evidenced by their regeneration, and doing the will of his Father; an which relation he owns, and is not ashamed of: they are also described by their number, "many"; for though they are but few, when compared with the world; yet they are many, a large number, considered by themselves; and among these, Christ is the "firstborn"; he is the firstborn of God, the begotten of the Father, he is the first begotten, and as such he is the only begotten; he is the firstborn of Mary, she had none before him, and he is the only one that ever was born in the manner he was; he is the first begotten from the dead, his resurrection is called a begetting, and he was the first in time that rose from the dead by his own power, and to an immortal life, and the first in causality and dignity. Christ is the firstborn with respect to all creatures in general; he was begotten of the Father before all creatures were; he is the first cause of them all, the governor, basis, and support of them: and he is the firstborn with respect to the saints; who are of the same nature with him, are made partakers of the divine nature, are sons in the same family, though not in the same class of sonship: moreover, this character may regard not so much birth as privilege which belongs to Christ as Mediator; who, as the firstborn had, has the blessing, the government, the priesthood, and the inheritance; all which is owing to, and is one end of divine predestination. The Cabalistic (m) writers among the Jews give the name of "firstborn" to the second Sephira, number, or person, "Wisdom", which answers to the Son of God. <p>(m) Vid.

The taking of the <span class="greekheb">πνοέγνω</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">prescience</span>, demanded by the signification of the word, has been followed (though with various, and in part very arbitrary, attempts to supply <span class="ital">that, as which</span> the persons concerned were foreknown by God) by Origen, Chrysostom, Augustine, Ambrosiaster, Jerome, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>., Toletus, Calovius, and others, including Reiche, Neander, Tholuck, Reithmayr, Maier, Philippi, van Hengel, Hahn, Ewald, Weiss, and others.

Comp. also <span class="greekheb">πρόγνωσις</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΓΝΩΣΤΙΚΌς</span></span></span>. An appeal is made to the familiar use of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΙΝΏΣΚ</span></span></span>. in the sense of <span class="ital">judicial</span> cognizance, or even of <span class="ital">other resolutions</span> and decisions (Herod. iv. 25, i. 74, 78; Thuc. iv. 30, iii. 99, and many other instances). But, in the first place, it is never in this sense joined with the accusative of the person without an infinitive; and secondly, there is no such precedent of usage for the <span class="ital">compound</span> <span class="greekheb">προγινώσκειν</span>, current as it was in Greek authors; for the few passages in which it means <span class="ital">to take forethought about something</span> (Thuc. ii. 64. 5; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr</span>. ii. 4. 11, with a very doubtful reading) are not suitable for comparison, either as regards the sense, or as respects the union with the personal accusative in our passage. The incorrectness of this explanation is confirmed, moreover, by the analogy of the following clauses, which always add another and <span class="ital">different</span> idea to the one preceding. The right interpretation remains, therefore: <span class="ital">praecognovit</span> (Vulg. = <span class="ital">praescivit</span>), which, however, is neither to be altered, with Augustine, Vatablus, Grotius, Estius, and others, into <span class="ital">approbavit jam ante</span>, to which view also Tholuck and Rückert incline (see on <a href="/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.">Romans 7:15</a>); nor to be taken, with Hofmann, in <span class="ital">that</span> sense of <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> which obtains in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-3.htm" title="But if any man love God, the same is known of him.">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his.

The latter, to which also Delitzsch ultimately comes, <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 39, is incorrect, because in accordance with it the <span class="greekheb">πρόγνωσις</span> would be a relation of communion already entered into actively by God, which would necessarily include the <span class="greekheb">προορισμός</span>, and consequently exclude the latter as a special and accessory act. For to suppose that Paul, with <span class="greekheb">προέγνω</span> and <span class="greekheb">προώρισε</span>, does not mean two acts following each other in succession, but asserts the former of the persons, and the latter of the character ascribed to them (Hofmann), is wholly groundless in presence of the clearly progressive description of the apostle. The right view, since faith is the subjective ground of salvation, is that held by Calovius and our older dogmatists: “quos <span class="ital">credituros</span> praevidit vel <span class="ital">suscepturos vocationem</span>.” It is <span class="ital">God’s being aware in His plan</span>, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to salvation, <span class="ital">He knows</span> whom He has to destine thereto.

On the other hand, the triumphant flow of the great chain of thought and the thoroughly Pauline boldness of expression (comp. on <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>) are misapprehended, if the act be regarded as accomplished only <span class="ital">in the decree of God</span> (Grotius, Reiche, and Umbreit); or if the expression be referred to the glory of God possessed “<span class="ital">at first only inwardly and secretly</span>” (Hofmann), or to “<span class="ital">repute with God</span>” (Märcker), or to the <span class="ital">bestowal of grace</span> and <span class="greekheb">υἱοθεσία</span> here below (Chrysostom and his followers, Ambrosiaster, Pelagius, and Erasmus), to which also van Hengel adheres, appealing to <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a> f. These verses give the proof that God in all things co-operates for good with the called. They show how His gracious purpose, beginning with foreknowledge and foreordination perfects all that concerns them on to the final glory. <span class="greekheb">οὓς προέγνω</span>: those whom He foreknew—in what sense? as persons who would answer His love with love? This is at least irrelevant, and alien to Paul’s general mode of thought. That salvation begins with God, and begins in eternity, are fundamental ideas with him, which he here applies to Christians, without raising any of the problems involved in the relation of the human will to the Divine. He comes upon these in chap. 9, but not here. Yet we may be sure that <span class="greekheb">προέγνω</span> has the pregnant sense that <span class="greekheb">γιγνώσκω</span> (<span class="greekheb">יָדַע</span>) often has in Scripture: <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a>, <a href="/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a> : hence we may render, “those of whom God took knowledge from eternity” (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>). <span class="greekheb">καὶ προώρισεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., “he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of His Son”. This conformity is the last stage in salvation, as <span class="greekheb">προέγνω</span> is the first. The image is in import not merely spiritual but eschatological. The Son of God is the Lord who appeared to Paul by Damascus: to be conformed to His image is to share His glory as well as His holiness. The Pauline Gospel is hopelessly distorted when this is forgotten. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν πρωτότοκον ἐν πολλοῖς ἀδελφοῖς</span>: the end in all this is the exaltation of Christ. It is implied in <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκον</span> that He also is regarded as only having attained the fulness of His Son-ship through the resurrection (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, and <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a> <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>). The idea of Christ’s dignity as firstborn among many brethren who all owe their salvation to Him is sublimely interpreted in <a href="/context/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings....">Hebrews 2:10-13</a>. The Apostle now resumes the series of the Divine acts in our salvation. <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ προώρισεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τούτους καὶ ἐκάλεσεν</span>. The eternal foreordination appears in time as “calling,” of course as effectual calling: where salvation is contemplated as the work of God alone (as here) there can be no breakdown in its processes. The next stages are summarily indicated. <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαίωσεν</span>: God in Jesus Christ forgave our sins, and accepted us as righteous in His sight; ungodly as we had been, He put us right with Himself. In that, everything else is included. The whole argument of chaps. 6–8 has been that justification and the new life of holiness in the Spirit are inseparable experiences. Hence Paul can take one step to the end, and write <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ ἐδικαίωσεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τούτους καὶ ἐδόξασεν</span>. Yet the tense in the last word is amazing. It is the most daring anticipation of faith that even the N.T. contains: the life is not to be taken out of it by the philosophical consideration that with God there is neither before nor after.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] The word introduces a fuller account of the “Call according to Purpose.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he did foreknow</span>] Same word as <a href="/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew.

And whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified</span>. Thus is introduced the doctrine of predestination. This is indeed a principal passage on which theological theories with regard to it have been built. It, with the context, is the basis of the definition of predestination in Art. 17. It is, therefore, of great importance to consider carefully what the apostle here really says, and appears most obviously to mean; it being the duty of the expositor to pay regard to this only, in view of the language used, the way it is introduced, and any cognate passages that may throw light upon it. We may observe, in the first place, that it is plain that more is spoken of here than <span class="accented">national</span> election, or predestination to a state of privilege, which is the subject especially treated in ch. 9. <span class="accented">Individual</span> predestination is in view; and this not to gospel privileges only, but also carrying with it the result of glory. But it still remains to be seen whether such predestination is regarded as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">absolute, i.e.</span> irrespective, with regard to its final result, of the <span class="accented">condition</span> of man's use of grace given; and, if so, whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">arbitrary, i.e.</span> irrespective of the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be, and themselves deserve. The Calvinistic view is that God from all eternity, of the mere good pleasure of his will, selected certain persons out of mankind to be the heirs of glory; the Arminian is that he foresaw from all eternity who would, in the exercise of their own free-will, respond to his purpose, and, in virtue of such foreknowledge, preordained them to glory. It is hardly necessary to consider whether there is any countenance given to the view that predestination ensures salvation, however a man may live; the obligation of actual holiness in Christians being (as we have seen) so strongly insisted on all along. If, then, the Calvinistic theory should appear to be supported, it must be with the proviso that predestination of necessity carries with it the grace of <span class="accented">perseverance</span> in good works, or at any rate a true conversion before the end, as well as final glory. Let us, in the first place, observe the way in which St. Paul introduces the subject, so as better to understand his drift. He has been speaking of the trials and imperfections of the present life, and urging his readers not to be discouraged by them, on the ground that, if they continue to "live after the Spirit," these things will by no means hinder, but rather further, the final issue. To strengthen this position he introduces the thought of God's eternal purpose; in effect thus: Your being in the state of grace in which you now feel yourselves to be, is due to God's eternal purpose to call you to this state, and thus in the end to save you. It is impossible that the circumstances in which he places you now, or any power whatever, should thwart God's eternal purpose. But it is not of necessity implied by anything that is actually said that the persons addressed might not themselves resist the Divine purpose. In fact, their own perseverance appears to be presupposed already, and they have been urged to it all along, as though their use of grace depended on themselves. Hence the apostle in this passage does not really touch the theoretic questions that have been raised by theologians, his purpose being simply the practical one of encouraging his readers to persevere and hope. We may now examine the successive expressions in the passage, and see what they imply. In ver. 28 the context shows <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to have especial reference to external circumstances of trial, and not at all to men's own sins. Calvin, commenting on it, quotes St. Augustine as saying, "Peceata quoque sua, ordinante Dei providentia, sanctis ideo non nocere ut potius corum saluti inserviant;" but while he assents to this proposition, he denies, with truth, that any such meaning is intended here. It may be observed, in passing, that Augustine's proposition, though it sounds strange, may, in a certain sense, be accepted as true: "We must continually err in order to be humble; our frailty and sins are the tools that God uses" (General Gordon's 'Letters to his Sister,' p. 371). Further, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, as though among those that love God only some are "the called;" nor can <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be understood as limiting <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, as though even of the called not all are called with the purpose of saving them. Only a preconceived idea could surely have suggested such an interpretation of the verse. In ver. 29 (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> bearing the sense of "to determine," as well as of "to know") <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> may possibly mean "predetermined" rather than "foreknew." Elsewhere in the New Testament, when used of men, it has the latter sense (<a href="/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>). When used of God, it may, as here, have either meaning (cf. <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>); but in the text last referred to the first meaning seems more probable. So also of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>. The distinction would not be of much importance but for the fact that the sense of "foreknew" has been pressed in support of the Arminian view; viz. that Divine predestination was consequent on the Divine foreknowledge of what men would be. It would not, indeed, really prove this view, since it might only mean that God knew beforehand the objects of his intended mercy. Calvin, though translating <span class="accented">praecognovit</span>, strongly rebuts the Arminian inference, saying, "Insulsi colligunt illi, quos dixi, Deum non alios elegisse nisi quos sua gratia dignos fore praevidit." Again, "Sequitur notitiam hanc a bene placito pendere, quia Deus nihil extra seipsum praeseivit quos voluit adoptando, sod tantum signavit quos eligere volebat.' <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (which might, perhaps, be better rendered <span class="accented">preordained</span>, which is its proper meaning, so as to avoid the necessary idea of irresistible destiny which is commonly associated with the word <span class="accented">predestinate</span>) must be taken, not absolutely, but in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. That the elect should in the first place be "conformed to the image of Christ" is all that is, here at least, denoted as preordained by God. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, may be understood, from the preceding context, to refer, primarily at least, to participation in Christ's sufferings (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Coming to ver. 30, we find the following sequence: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> eternal foreknowledge (or eternal purpose), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> preordination to fellowship with Christ, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> calling (to acceptance of the gospel), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> justification, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> glorification.  <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (4) means the participation in God's <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, the passing into a "state of salvation" through faith in baptism. But what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (5) has been a subject of discussion. Some, in view of the aorist, not future, tense of the verb, understand it of <span class="accented">sanctification</span> subsequent to <span class="accented">justification</span>, regarded as participation in the <span class="accented">glory</span> of the Divine holiness. Others, in view of the significance of the word itself, understand future glory, the aorist being accounted, for by the apostle's taking in one view the whole process of salvation with its final result, which is contemplated as accomplished. Perhaps both ideas are included, present sanctification being regarded as the commencement and earnest of the full glory to be revealed in "the sons of God" hereafter. In any case, we are not bound by what is here said to conclude that final glory of necessity follows the previous stages. For the apostle may be only setting forth the process and result when grace is not resisted. But certainly he implies that, when the result is glory, all is to be traced, not to man's initiation or deservings, but to Divine grace, and the Divine purpose of mercy from eternity. In the remainder of this chapter the apostle rises into a strain of glowing eloquence, into a very song of triumph, in view of the assured hope of faithful Christians. Faithfulness, be it once more observed, is presupposed throughout the passage, which is quite wrongly understood as encouraging confidence in any on the ground of their conviction that they are certainly, even in spite of themselves, predestinated to glory: it only encourages perseverance in spite of trial on the ground of our feeling that, if we do persevere, we cannot fail, because God is on our side, and it is his eternal purpose to save us. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did foreknow (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;)<p>Five times in the New Testament. In all cases it means foreknow. <a href="/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>; <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>. It does not mean foreordain. It signifies prescience, not preelection. "It is God's being aware in His plan, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to salvation, He knows whom He has to destine thereto" (Meyer).<p>It is to be remarked:<p>1. That &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; foreknew is used by the apostle as distinct and different from predestinated (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;).<p>2. That, strictly speaking, it is coordinate with foreordained. "In God is no before." All the past, present, and future are simultaneously present to Him. In presenting the two phases, the operation of God's knowledge and of His decretory will, the succession of time is introduced, not as metaphysically true, but in concession to human limitations of thought. Hence the coordinating force of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; also.<p>3. That a predetermination of God is clearly stated as accompanying or (humanly speaking) succeeding, and grounded upon the foreknowledge.<p>4. That this predetermination is to the end of conformity to the image of the Son of God, and that this is the vital point of the passage.<p>5. That, therefore, the relation between foreknowledge and predestination is incidental, and is not contemplated as a special point of discussion. God's foreknowledge and His decree are alike aimed at holy character and final salvation.<p>"O thou predestination, how remote<p>Thy root is from the aspect of all those<p>Who the First Cause do not behold entire!<p>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained<p>In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,<p>We do not known as yet all the elect;<p>continued...</body></html>
