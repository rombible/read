He dwells in the heart by faith. Grace in the soul is its new nature; the soul is alive to God, and has begun its holy happiness which shall endure for ever. The righteousness of Christ imputed, secures the soul, the better part, from death. From hence we see how much it is our duty to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. If any habitually live according to corrupt lustings, they will certainly perish in their sins, whatever they profess. And what can a worldly life present, worthy for a moment to be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, by the Spirit, endeavour more and more to mortify the flesh. Regeneration by the Holy Spirit brings a new and Divine life to the soul, though in a feeble state. And the sons of God have the Spirit to work in them the disposition of children; they have not the spirit of bondage, which the Old Testament church was under, through the darkness of that dispensation. The Spirit of adoption was not then plentifully poured out. Also it refers to that spirit of bondage, under which many saints were at their conversion. Many speak peace to themselves, to whom God does not speak peace. But those who are sanctified, have God's Spirit witnessing with their spirits, in and by his speaking peace to the soul. Though we may now seem to be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And if Christ be in you - This is evidently a figurative expression, where the word "Christ" is used to denote his spirit, his principles; that is, he influences the man. Literally, he cannot be in a Christian; but the close connection between him and Christians, and the fact that they are entirely under his influence, is expressed by this strong figurative language. It is language which is not infrequently used; compare <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>.<p>(The union between Christ and his people is sometimes explained of a merely relative in opposition to a real union. The union which subsists between a substitute, or surety, and the persons in whose room he has placed himself, is frequently offered in explanation of the Scripture language on the subject. In this view, Christ is regarded as legally one with his people, inasmuch, as what he has done or obtained, is held as done and obtained by them. Another relative union, employed to illustrate that which subsists between Christ and believers, is the union of a chief and his followers, which is simply a union of design, interest, sentiment, affection, destiny, etc. Now these representations are true so far as they go; and furnish much interesting and profitable illustration. They fall short, however, of the full sense of Scripture on the point. That there is a real or vital union between Christ and his people, appears from the language of the inspired writers in regard to it.<p>The special phraseology which they employ, cannot well be explained of any relative union At all events, it is as strong as they could have employed, on the supposition, that they had wished to convey the idea of the most intimate possible connection. Christ is said to be "in them," and they are represented as "in him." He "abides in them, and they in him." They "dwelt" in each other; <a href="/john/14-20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>. Moreover, the Scripture illustrations of the subject furnish evidence to the same effect. The mystical union, as it has been called, is compared to the union of stones in a building, branches in a vine, members in a human body, and even to what subsists between the Father and the Son; <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-8</a>; 1Co. 12:12-31; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>. Now if all these are real unions, is not this union real also? If not, where is the propriety or justice of the comparisons? Instead of leading us to form accurate notions on the subject, they would seem calculated to mislead.<p>This real and vital union is formed by the one Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit pervading the Head and the members of the mystical body; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-13.htm">1 John 4:13</a>. It is true, indeed, that the essential presence of Christ's Spirit is everywhere, but he is present in Christ's members, in a special way, as the fountain of spiritual influence. This spiritual presence, which is the bond of union, is manifested immediately upon a man's reception of Christ by faith. From that hour he is one with Christ, because the same Spirit lives in both. Indeed this union is the foundation of all the relative unions which have been employed to illustrate the subject; without it, we could have no saving relation to Christ whatever. That it is mysterious cannot be denied. The apostle himself affirms as much, <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>. Although we know the fact, we cannot explain the manner of it, but must not on this account reject it, any more than we would the doctrine of the Spirit's essential presence, because we do not understand it.)<p>The body is dead - This passage has been interpreted in very different ways. Some understand it to mean that the body is dead in respect to sin; that is, that sin has no more power to excite evil passions and desires; others, that the body must die on account of sin but that the spiritual part shall live, and even the body shall live also in the resurrection. Thus, Calvin, Beza, and Augustine. Doddridge understands it thus: Though the body is to die on account of the first sin that entered into the world, yet the spirit is life, and shall continue to live on forever, through that righteousness which the second Adam has introduced." To each of these interpretations there are serious objections, which it is not necessary to urge. I understand the passage in the following manner: The body refers to that of which the apostle had said so much in the previous chapters - the flesh, the man before conversion. It is subject to corrupt passions and desires, and may be said thus to be dead, as it has none of the elements of spiritual life. It is under the reign of sin and death. The word &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;  men, indeed, or truly, has been omitted in our translation, and the omission has obscured the sense. The expression is an admission of the apostle, or a summary statement of what had before been shown. "It is to be admitted, indeed, or it is true, that the unrenewed nature, the man before conversion, under the influence of the flesh, is spiritually dead. Sin has its seat in the fleshly appetites; and the whole body may be admitted thus to be dead or corrupt."<p>Because of sin - Through sin &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  di' hamartia; by means of sinful passions and appetites.<p>But the spirit - This stands opposed to the body; and it means that the soul, the immortal part, the renovated man, was alive, or was under the influence of living principles. It was imbued with the life which the gospel imparts and had become active in the service of God. The word "spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the spirit of man, the immortal part, recovered, renewed, and imbued with life under the gospel.<p>Because of righteousness - Through righteousness &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  dia dikaiosune&#772;n. This is commonly interpreted to mean, with reference to righteousness, or that it may become righteous. But I understand the expression to be used in the sense in which the word is so frequently used in this Epistle, as denoting God's plan of justification; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. "The spirit of man has been recovered and made alive through his plan of justification. It communicates life, and recovers man from his death in sin to life."<p>The "body" in this passage has generally been understood in the literal sense, which, doubtless, ought not to be rejected without some valid reason. There is nothing in the connection that demands the figurative sense. The apostle admits that, notwithstanding of the indwelling of the Spirit, the body must die. "It indeed (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  men ) is dead because of sin." The believer is not delivered from temporal death. Yet there are two things which may well reconcile him to the idea of laying aside for a while the clay tabernacle. The "mortal body," though it now die, is not destined to remain forever under the dominion of death, but shall be raised again incorruptible and glorious, by the power of the same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead. Meanwhile, "the spirit, or soul, is life, because of righteousness." In consequence of that immaculate righteousness, of which Paul had had said so much in the previous part of this Epistle, the souls of believers, even now, enjoy spiritual life, which shall issue in eternal life and glory.<p>Those who understand &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  so&#772;ma figuratively in the 10th verse, insist, indeed, that the resurrection in the 11th, is figurative also. But "the best commentators" says Bloomfield, "both ancient and modern, with reason prefer the literal view, especially on account of the phrase &#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  thne&#772;ta &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  so&#772;mata which seems to confine it to this sense.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11.

Not as he is in the whole world, and in all his creatures, or circumscriptively, and to the exclusion of himself elsewhere; for his person is above in heaven, his blood is within the vail, his righteousness is upon his people, and his Spirit and grace are in them; and so he comes to be in them, he is formed in their hearts by the Spirit of God in regeneration, when the Father reveals him not only to them, but in them; and he himself enters and takes possession of them as his own, manifests himself to them, communicates his grace, and grants them communion with him. This being their case, <p>the body is dead because of sin: by which is meant, not the body of sin, though this is called a body, and a body of death, yet is not dead, much less is it so by reason of sin; but this fleshly body, because liable to afflictions, which are called deaths, has the seeds of mortality in it, and shall in a little time die, notwithstanding the gift of it to Christ, though it is redeemed by his blood, and united to him; the reason of it is not merely the decree of God, nor does it arise from the original constitution of the body, but sin is the true reason of it, sin original and actual, indwelling sin, but not by way of punishment for it, for Christ has bore that, death is one of the saints' privileges, it is for their good, and therefore desired by them; but that they might be rid of it, and free from all those troubles which are the consequences of it: <p>but the spirit is life, because of righteousness; not the Spirit of God, who lives in himself, is the author of life to others, of natural and spiritual life, continues as a principle of life in the saints, is the pledge of everlasting life, and is so to them because of the righteousness of Christ nor grace, or the new creature, which is sometimes called Spirit, and may be said to be life, it lives unto righteousness, and is owing to and supported by the righteousness of the Son of God; but the soul of man is here meant, in opposition to the body, which is of a spiritual nature, immaterial and immortal; and this may be said in believers to be life or live, for it not only lives naturally, but spiritually; it lives a life of holiness from Christ, a life of faith upon him, and a life of justification by him, and will live eternally; first in a separate state from the body after death, till the resurrection morn, it does not die with the body, nor sleep with it in the grave, nor is it in any "limbus" or state of purgatory, but in paradise, in heaven, in the arms and presence of Christ, where it is not inactive, but employed in the best of service: and after the resurrection it will live with the body in glory for evermore; and this is owing to righteousness, not to the righteousness of man, but the imputed righteousness of Christ; for as it was sin, and loss of righteousness thereby which brought death on man, the righteousness of Christ is that on which believers live now, and is their right and title to eternal life hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> And if Christ <i>be</i> in you, the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> body <i>is</i> dead because of sin; but the Spirit <i>is</i> life because of righteousness.</span><p>(12) He confirms the faithful against the relics of flesh and sin, granting that these things are yet (as appears by the corruption which is in them) having effects on one of their parts (which he calls the body, that is to say, a lump) which is not yet purged from this earthly filthiness in death: but in addition not wanting to doubt at all of the happy success of this combat, because even this little spark of the Spirit (that is, of the grace of regeneration), which is evidently in them as appears by the fruits of righteousness, is the seed of life.<p>(n) The flesh, or all that which as yet remains fast in the grips of sin and death.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>.

These grounds, collectively, tell at the same time against the divergent explanations: (1) that in <a href="/context/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness....">Romans 8:10-11</a> it is <span class="ital">spiritual</span> death and life that are spoken of; so Erasmus, Piscator, Locke, Heumann, Ch. Schmidt, Stolz, Böhme, Benecke, Köllner, Schrader, Stengel, Krehl, and van Hengel. (2) That <a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a> is to be taken in the spiritual, but <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a> in the proper sense; so Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Grotius, Koppe, Olshausen, Reithmayr, and others; de Wette unites the moral <span class="ital">and</span> physical sense in <span class="ital">both</span> verses, comp. also Nielsen and Umbreit; see the particulars below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νεκρόν</span>] With this corresponds the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΝΗΤΆ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>. It conveys, however, the idea “<span class="ital">conditioni mortis obnoxium</span>” (Augustine) more forcibly, and so as vividly to realize the certain result—<span class="ital">he is dead!</span>—a prolepsis of the final fate, which cannot now be altered or avoided. Well is it said by Bengel: “magni vi; morti adjudicatum deditumque.” Our body is a <span class="ital">corpse</span>!

Others take it as: <span class="ital">miserable by reason of sin</span> (Michaelis, Koppe, Köllner), comp. de Wette: “Even in the redeemed there still remains the sinful inclination as source of the death, which expresses its power;” Krehl as: “<span class="ital">morally dead;</span>” Olshausen: “not in the glory of its original destiny;” Tholuck: in the sense of <a href="/romans/7-10.htm" title="And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.">Romans 7:10</a> f., but also “including in itself the elements of moral life-disturbance and of misery.” Since, however, it is the <span class="ital">body</span> that is just spoken of, and since <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἁμαρτίαν</span> could only bring up the recollection of the proposition in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>, every view, which does not understand it of <span class="ital">bodily</span> death, is contrary to the context and far-fetched, especially since <span class="greekheb">θνητά</span> in <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a> corresponds to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑΝ</span></span></span>] The ground: <span class="ital">on account of sin, in consequence</span> of sin (Kühner, II. 1, p. 419), which is more precisely known from <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>. Death, which has arisen and become general through the entrance of sin into the world, can be averted in no case, not even in that of the regenerate man. Hence, even in his case, the <span class="ital">body</span> is <span class="greekheb">νεκρόν διʼ ἁμαρτίαν</span>. But how completely different is it in <span class="ital">his case</span> with the <span class="ital">spirit!</span> <span class="greekheb">Τὸ πνεῦμα</span>, namely, in contrast to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣῶΜΑ</span></span></span>, is necessarily not the <span class="ital">transcendent</span> (Holsten) or the <span class="ital">Holy</span> Spirit (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Calvin, Grotius, and others); nor yet, as Hofmann turns the conception, the spirit which we now have <span class="ital">when Christ is in us</span> and <span class="ital">His righteousness is ours;</span> but simply our <span class="ital">human spirit, i.e.</span> the substratum of the personal self-consciousness, and as such the principle of the higher cognitive and moral activity of life as directed towards God, different from the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span>, which is to be regarded as the potentiality of the human natural life. The faculty of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> is the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΟῦς</span></span></span> (<a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

That the spirit of those who are here spoken of is filled with the Holy Spirit, is in itself a correct inference from the presupposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΧΡΙΣΤῸς ἘΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, but is not implied in the <span class="ital">word</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span>, as if this meant (Theodoret and de Wette) the human spirit pervaded by the Divine Spirit, the pneumatic essence of the regenerate man.

With respect to the spirit of the true Christian, therefore, there can be no mention of <span class="ital">death</span> (which would of necessity be <span class="ital">eternal</span> death); comp. <a href="/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?">John 11:26</a>. He is <span class="ital">eternally alive</span>, and that <span class="greekheb">διὰ δικαιοσύνην</span>, <span class="ital">on account of righteousness;</span> for the eternal <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> is based on the justification that has taken place for Christ’s sake and is appropriated by faith. Rückert, Reiche, Fritzsche, Philippi (comp. also Hofmann), following the majority of ancient expositors, have properly taken <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗΝ</span></span></span> thus in the Pauline-<span class="ital">dogmatic</span> sense, seeing that the <span class="ital">moral righteousness of life</span> (Erasmus, Grotius, Tholuck, de Wette, Klee, and Maier), because never perfect (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>, <span class="ital">al</span>.), can never be ground of the <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>.

It is moreover to be noted, that as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ἉΜΑΡΤ</span></span></span>. does not refer to one’s own individual sin (on the contrary, see on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ ΠΆΝΤΕς ἭΜΑΡΤΟΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>), so neither does <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗΝ</span></span></span> refer to one’s own righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, further, the fact that, and the mode in which, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> may be lost according to our passage, namely, if Christ is not in us,—a condition, by which the moral nature of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> is laid down and security is guarded against.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>. Consequences of this indwelling of Christ in the Christian. In one respect, they are not yet so complete as might be expected. <span class="greekheb">τὸ μὲν σῶμα νεκρὸν</span>: the body, it cannot be denied, is <span class="ital">dead</span> because of sin: the experience we call death is inevitable for it. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ πνεῦμα ζωή</span>: but the spirit (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the human spirit, as is shown by the contrast with <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>) is life, God-begotten, God-sustained life, and therefore beyond the reach of death. As death is due to sin, so is this life to <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>. It is probably not real to distinguish here between “justification” and “moral righteousness of life,” and to say that the word means either to the exclusion of the other. The whole argument of chaps. 6–8. is that neither can exist without the other. No man can begin to be good till he is justified freely by God’s grace in Christ Jesus, and no one has been so justified who has not begun to live the good life in the spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">If Christ be in you</span>] Observe the immediate transition from “the Spirit of Christ” to “Christ.” See again <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>, for a deeply suggestive parallel. See too each of the Seven Epistles (Revelation 2, 3) for the identification (in a certain sense) of the Voice of Christ and the Voice of the Spirit. The supreme work of the Spirit is to acquaint the soul with Christ; hence the indwelling of the Spirit as the Divine Teacher results by holy necessity in the indwelling of Christ as the Divine Guest. Again cp. <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the body</span>, &c.] Lit. <span class="bld">the body indeed is dead</span>, &c. The sentence may be paraphrased; “though the body is dead, &c., yet the spirit is life.”—“<span class="ital">The body</span>” is here the literal body (see next ver.), doomed to death, and so already “as good as dead;” not yet “redeemed” (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>). It cannot here mean “the flesh” (in the sense of that word in this context) because just below it is promised that the body shall be “<span class="ital">made alive</span>” hereafter by the Holy Ghost; whereas “<span class="ital">crucifixion</span>” is the doom of “the flesh.” In short, the Christian is here reminded that the penal results of sin still affect the <span class="ital">body</span> so that it must <span class="ital">die;</span> but that the regenerate spirit is rescued from the spirit’s death.—Many bodies, indeed, (those of the living at the Last Day) will not, in the common sense, die; but they will cease to be “flesh and blood.” (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption....">1 Corinthians 15:50-52</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the spirit</span>] Here the context seems to give the sense of the <span class="ital">human</span> spirit; that which now “liveth unto God” in the regenerate man; the soul, in the highest sense of that word.

Cp. “ye are light,” <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a>. The spirit is not only “alive:” life is its <span class="ital">inmost characteristic</span>. The “life” here is that of acceptance and peace with God; the antithesis of the doom of death.

Thus the meaning of the first clause of ver. 10 would be, "If Christ be in you, the body of sin in you is dead; but you are alive in the Spirit." Decisive objections to this view are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by itself is not elsewhere used as an equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, but as denoting our mere <span class="accented">bodily</span> organization. This statement is consistent with the metaphorical application of the word sometimes in a different verse, as in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, above quoted, and in <a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>. Observe also <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11, which can hardly be taken but as expressing what is intended here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) cannot be forced out of its proper meaning of "<span class="accented">because</span> of," which, according to the view we are considering, would be unintelligible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that ver. 11, which is obviously connected in thought with ver. 10, cannot well be brought into tune with it according to the view proposed. All is made clear, in view both of language and of context, by taking these two verses as introducing a new thought, which is carried out afterwards in ver. 18, viz. that of the drawback to the full enjoyment and development of our spiritual life owing to the mortal bodies which clothe us now and the purpose is to bid us believe in the reality of our redemption, and persevere in correspondent life, notwithstanding such present drawback. Thus the idea is that, though in our present earthly state the mortal body is death-stricken in consequence of sin (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - subject to the doom of Adam, that extended to all his race (cf. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc.) - yet, Christ being in us now, the same Divine Spirit that raised him from the dead will in us too at last overcome mortality. cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the same word as in ver. 11 here); and compare also all that follows in that chapter. This view of the meaning of the passage before us is strongly confirmed by our finding, in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-5:6</a>, exactly the same idea carried out at length, with a correspondence also of the language used. The frail, mortal, ever-dying earthen vessels, in which we have now the treasure of our life in Christ, are there regarded as crippling the expansion of our spiritual life, and causing us to "groan, being burdened" (cf. in the chapter before us, ver. 23, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); but the very consciousness of this higher life within him, yearning so for an adequate and deathless organism, assures the apostle that God has one in store for him, having already given him "the earnest of the Spirit." And this seems to be what is meant hereby "shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." As to particular expressions in the verses before us, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, applied to "the <span class="accented">body</span>," may be taken to mean <span class="accented">infected with death, and doomed to it</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a> - <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, given as the reason for the Spirit being life, may be explained with reference to the essential conception of <span class="accented">righteousness</span> throughout the Epistle, as God's <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, revealed in Christ, and made over to man as the remedy of human sin. Before carrying out the thought peculiarly suggested by the last two verses (as is done at ver. 18), the apostle now draws a conclusion (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) from what has been so far said, so as to press the more the obligation of a spiritual <span class="accented">life</span> in Christians. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The body<p>The believer's natural body.<p>The spirit<p>The believer's human spirit. </body></html>
