(Comp. <a href="/context/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17-18</a>.) It was made subject to this “not willingly,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by its own act or with its own concurrence, but “by reason of Him who hath subjected the same,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in pursuance of the sovereign purpose and counsel of God. The one thing which takes out the sting from this impoverished and degraded condition is Hope.<p>It is needless to say that this is not Darwinism, but it is easily reconcilable with evolution. Indeed, such a theory seems to give it additional force and emphasis. It helps to bring out both the present “vanity” and hope for the future, and to show both as parts of one “increasing purpose” widening through the ages. “Allowing for irregularities and fluctuations, on the whole, higher and higher forms of life have appeared. There has been unquestionably an enormous advance between the times of the Eozoon Canadense and our own. And, further, we have to notice that a new kind of progress, of far greater intrinsic importance than mere physical improvement, has of late appeared. I mean intellectual and moral progress, as it is seen in man. . . . And this progress, I would say, is most important in our argument as to the character of God, for it is full of promise of far better things than this sad world has ever seen. It points most decidedly to a supremacy of the power for good, and a great hope of final happiness for our race.” (Rev. S. T. Gibson, <span class= "ital">Religion and Science,</span> p. 34.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,...">Romans 8:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the creature was made subject to vanity </span>— Mankind in general, and the whole visible creation, lost their original beauty, glory, and felicity; a sad change passed on man, and his place of abode; the whole face of nature was obscured, and all creatures were subjected to vanity and wretchedness in a variety of forms. “Every thing seems perverted from its intended use: the inanimate creatures are pressed into man’s rebellion; the luminaries of the heaven give him light by which to work wickedness; the fruits of the earth are sacrificed to his luxury, intemperance, and ostentation; its bowels are ransacked for metals, from which arms are forged, for public and private murder and revenge; or to gratify his avarice, and excite him to fraud, oppression, and war. The animal tribes are subject to pain and death through man’s sin, and their sufferings are exceedingly increased by his cruelty, who, instead of a kind master, is become their inhuman butcher and tyrant. So that every thing is in an unnatural state: the <span class="ital">good </span>creatures of God <span class="ital">appear evil, </span>through man’s abuse of them; and even the enjoyment originally to be found in them is turned into vexation, bitterness, and disappointment, by his idolatrous love of them, and expectation from them.” — Scott. “Vanity,” says Macknight, “denotes mortality or <span class="ital">corruption, </span><a href="/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>, and all the miseries of the present life.

It is certain the whole creation would be made inconceivably more happy than it is, if that blessed dispensation by which we are introduced into God’s family, and taught to do our utmost to diffuse good to all around us, were universally to prevail. But the <span class="ital">bondage of corruption, </span>being here opposed to the <span class="ital">freedom of the glory </span>(as the words <span class="greekheb">ελευθεριαν της δοξης </span>literally signify) <span class="ital">of the children of God, </span>must especially signify the destruction of the body by death, and the continuation of it in the grave, and of course <span class="ital">the freedom of the glory </span>must signify its resurrection and immortality. When this is effected, “Satan, sin, death, misery, and all wicked creatures, will be consigned to hell; and the rest of God’s creation will appear glorious, pure, beautiful, orderly, and happy; in every respect answering the end for which it was formed, and in nothing abused to contrary purposes. See <a href="/context/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them....">Revelation 20:11-15</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea....">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. The sufferings of animals, though very many and grievous, yet being <span class="ital">unfeared </span>and <span class="ital">transient, </span>are doubtless overbalanced by their enjoyments; and to infer an individual resurrection of all or any of them from this passage, is surely one of the wildest reveries which ever entered into the mind of a thinking man. The happy effects produced by the gospel, when extensively successful, even in this present world, may be considered as earnests of the glorious scene of which the apostle speaks: but the general resurrection, and the state which follows, were especially, and indeed exclusively meant, for then only will the children of God be <span class="ital">manifested </span>as such, and be separated from all others.” — Scott.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the creature - The renewed creature; the Christian mind. This is given as a reason for its aspiring to the full privileges of adoption, that the present state is not one of choice, or one which is preferred, but one to which it has been subjected for wise reasons by God.<p>Subject to vanity - The word "subject to" means placed in such a state; subjected to it by the appointment of another, as a soldier has his rank and place assigned him in an army. The word "vanity" here &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  mataiote&#772;s is descriptive of the present condition of the Christian, as frail and dying; as exposed to trials, temptations, and cares; as in the midst of conflicts, and of a world which may be emphatically pronounced vanity. More or less, the Christian is brought under this influence; his joys are marred; his peace is discomposed; his affections wander; his life is a life of vanity and vexation.<p>Not willingly - Not voluntarily. It is not a matter of choice. It is not what is congenial to his renewed nature. That would aspire to perfect holiness and peace. But this subjection is one that is contrary to it, and from which he desires to be delivered. This describes substantially the same condition as <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15-24</a>.<p>But by reason - By him &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;  dia. It is the appointment of God, who has chosen to place his people in this condition; and who for wise purposes retains them in it.<p>Who hath subjected the same - Who has appointed his people to this condition. It is his wise arrangement. Here we may observe,<p>(1) That the instinctive feelings of Christians lead them to desire a purer and a happier world, <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>.<p>(2) that it is not what they desire, to be subjected to the toils of this life, and to the temptations and vanities of this world. They sigh for deliverance.<p>(3) their lot in life; their being subjected to this state of vanity, is the arrangement of God. Why it is, he has not seen fit to inform us fully. He might have taken his people at once to heaven as soon as they are converted. But though we know not all the reasons why they are continued here in this state of vanity, we can see some of them:<p>(a) Christians are subjected to this state to do good to their fellow sinners. They remain on earth for this purpose: and this should be their leading aim.<p>(b) By their remaining here the power of the gospel is shown in overcoming their sin; in meeting their temptations; in sustaining them in trial; and in thus furnishing living evidence to the world of the power and excellency of that gospel. This could not be attained if they were removed at once to heaven.<p>(c) It furnishes occasion for some interesting exhibitions of character - for hope, and faith, and love, and for increasing and progressive excellence.<p>(d) It is a proper training for heaven. It brings out the Christian character, and fits it for the skies. There may be inestimable advantages, all of which we may not see, in subjecting the Christian to a process of training in overcoming his sins, and in producing confidence in God, before he is admitted to his state of final rest.<p>(e) It is fit and proper that he should engage here in the service of Him who has redeemed him. He has been ransomed by the blood of Christ, and God has the highest claim on him in all the conflicts and toils, in all the labors and services to which he may be subjected in this life.<p>In hope - See the note at <a href="/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>. Hope has reference to the future; and in this state of the Christian, he sighs for deliverance, and expects it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

The next verse tells us it is subject to <span class="ital">the bondage of corruption</span> as well as vanity. Now this must needs be an unwilling subjection, therefore it is here said it is <span class="bld">not</span> subject <span class="bld">willingly, </span> i.e. of its own accord, or of its proper instinct and inclination. What the will is in those that are rational, the inclination is in those things that are natural; how comes it then into this condition? The next clause tells us, it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope:</span> i.e. God, for the sin of man, hath cursed the creature, and subjected it to vanity and corruption: see <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17</a> 4:12 <a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm" title="And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:">Leviticus 26:19</a>,20</span>. And though he hath done this, yet there is ground to expect and hope that the creature shall return again to its former estate wherein it was created; that it shall be delivered and restored into a better condition, as in the next verse. Those that by <span class="ital">the creature</span> understand the Gentile world, give a different interpretation of these words; they say that the Gentiles are <span class="ital">made subject to vanity, </span> i.e. to idolatry, or a vain, superstitious worship, (idols are called <span class="ital">vanities, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things?

This designs the vanity and emptiness of the minds of the Gentiles, who were without God and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, without the law and Gospel, and grace of God; also the vain conceits they had of themselves, of their wisdom, knowledge, learning, and eloquence; likewise their vain philosophy, particularly their gross idolatry, their polytheism, or worshipping of many gods; together with their divers lusts and vices, to which they were addicted, to such a degree, that they might be truly said to be made subject thereunto, being under the government of these things, slaves unto them, and in such subjection, as that they could not deliver themselves from it; though it is said, <p>not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Though they were willingly vain, yet they were not willingly made subject to vanity; they willingly went into idolatrous and other evil practices, but the devil made them subject, or slaves unto them; he led them captive at his will, and powerfully worked in them, by divine permission, so that they became vassals to him, and to their lusts; for he seems to be designed, "by him who hath subjected the same", and not Adam, by whom sin entered into the world. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the creature was made subject to <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> vanity, not <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> willingly, but by reason <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> of him who hath subjected <i>the same</i> in <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> hope,</span><p>(x) Is subject to a vanishing and disappearing state.<p>(y) Not by their natural inclination.<p>(z) That they should obey the Creator's commandment, whom it pleased to show by their sickly state, how greatly he was displeased with man.<p>(a) God would not make the world subject to be cursed forever because of the sin of man, but gave it hope that it would be restored.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,...">Romans 8:20-21</a>.

But that repetition is necessitated by the emphasis of the similarity of the relation, which <span class="greekheb">αὐτὴ ἡ κτίσις</span> has over-against the children of God, for which reason Paul did not write <span class="greekheb">ὅτι καὶ ἐλευθερωθήσεται</span> (in opposition to Hofmann’s objection).

The sentence on man, however, was not hopeless, and creation shared in his hope as in his doom. When the curse is completely removed from man, as it will be when the sons of God are revealed, it will pass from creation also; and for this creation sighs.

Thus the assertions of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: and 31, stand unshaken, viz. that in the beginning God created all things, and that all at first was "very good."

It was his will that it should be so; this is all we know; except that we find the beginning of evil, so far as it affects man, attributed in Scripture to human sin. But he so subjected his creation <span class="accented">in hope.</span> This expression may refer to the <span class="accented">protoevangelium</span> of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, or to the never-dying hope in the human heart; to either or to both. The latter idea is expressed in the myth of Pandora's box. Further, the creature is said to have been so subjected "not willingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). No sentient beings acquiesce in suffering; they resent evil, and would fain flee from it. Man especially unwillingly submits to his present bondage. When in ver. 21 the hope is expressed of the creature (or creation) itself being eventually freed from the present bondage of corruption, it may be that the human part of creation only is in the writer's eye; but it may be also (there being still no expressed limitation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) that he conceives a final emancipation of the whole creation from evil (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23-27</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). But if so, it is not said that the peculiar glory of the sons of God will extend to all creation, but only that all will be freed into the freedom of their glory; which may mean that the day of the revelation of the sons of God in glory will bring with it a general emancipation of all creation from its present bondage. Such a great final hope finds expression in the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />One God, one law, one element,<br />And one far-off Divine event,<br />To which the whole creation moves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">In Memoriam.'</span>) The present condition of things is in ver. 20 denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and in ver. 21 by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>.

It is often applied to idols, and it is the word in Ecclesiastes where it is said that "all is vanity" (cf. also <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5, 6</a>). It seems here to denote the frailty, incompleteness, transitoriness, to which all things are now subject. "<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> sonat frustatio, quod creatura interim non assequatur quod utcunque contendit efficere" (Erasmus). <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> intimates corruption and decay. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Vanity (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here, <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>. Compare the kindred verb became vain (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a> note), and the adjective vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). Vain is also used to render &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="/james/2-20.htm">James 2:20</a>). &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; signifies empty; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; idle, resultless. &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, used of persons, implies not merely the absence of good, but the presence of evil. So <a href="/james/2-20.htm">James 2:20</a>. The Greek proverb runs. "The empty think empty things." &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; expresses aimlessness. All which has not God for the true end of its being is &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Pindar describes the vain man as one who hunts bootless things with fruitless hopes. Plato ("Laws," 735) of labor to no purpose. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>, "prophesying vain things (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)," things which God will not bring to pass. Compare <a href="/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>. Here, therefore, the reference is to a perishable and decaying condition, separate from God, and pursuing false ends.<p>By reason of Him who hath subjected (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>God, not Adam nor Satan. Paul does not use the grammatical form which would express the direct agency of God, by Him who hath subjected, but that which makes God's will the occasion rather than the worker - on account of Him. Adam's sin and not God's will was the direct and special cause of the subjection to vanity. The supreme will of God is thus removed "to a wider distance from corruption and vanity" (Alford). </body></html>
