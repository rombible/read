Depending on Divine grace, they must detest and dread all evil, and love and delight in whatever is kind and useful. We must not only do that which is good, but we must cleave to it. All our duty towards one another is summed up in one word, love. This denotes the love of parents to their children; which is more tender and natural than any other; unforced, unconstrained. And love to God and man, with zeal for the gospel, will make the wise Christian diligent in all his wordly business, and in gaining superior skill. God must be served with the spirit, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. He is honoured by our hope and trust in him, especially when we rejoice in that hope. He is served, not only by working for him, but by sitting still quietly, when he calls us to suffer. Patience for God's sake, is true piety. Those that rejoice in hope, are likely to be patient in tribulation. We should not be cold in the duty of prayer, nor soon weary of it. Not only must there be kindness to friends and brethren, but Christians must not harbour anger against enemies. It is but mock love, which rests in words of kindness, while our brethren need real supplies, and it is in our power to furnish them. Be ready to entertain those who do good: as there is occasion, we must welcome strangers. Bless, and curse not. It means thorough good will; not, bless them when at prayer, and curse them at other times; but bless them always, and curse not at all. True Christian love will make us take part in the sorrows and joys of each other. Labour as much as you can to agree in the same spiritual truths; and when you come short of that, yet agree in affection. Look upon worldly pomp and dignity with holy contempt. Do not mind it; be not in love with it. Be reconciled to the place God in his providence puts you in, whatever it be. Nothing is below us, but sin. We shall never find in our hearts to condescend to others, while we indulge conceit of ourselves; therefore that must be mortified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be kindly affectioned - The word used here occurs no where else in the New Testament. It properly denotes tender affection, such as what subsists between parents and children; and it means that Christians should have similar feelings toward each other, as belonging to the same family, and as united in the same principles and interests. The Syriac renders this, "Love your brethren, and love one another;" compare <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>.<p>With brotherly love - Or in love to the brethren. The word denotes the affection which subsists between brethren. The duty is one which is often presented in the New Testament, and which our Saviour intended should be regarded as a badge of discipleship; see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>, "By this shall all people know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another;" <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>, <a href="/john/15-17.htm">John 15:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20-21</a>. The apostle Paul in this place manifests his unique manner of writing. He does not simply enjoin brotherly love, but he adds that it should be kindly affectioned. It should be with the tenderness which characterizes the most endearing natural relationship. This he expresses by a word which is made for the occasion (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  philostorgoi), blending love with natural affection, and suffering it to be manifest in your contact with one another.<p>In honour - In showing or manifesting respect or honor. Not in seeking honor, or striving after respect, but in showing it to one another.<p>Preferring one another - The word "preferring" means going before, leading, setting an example. Thus, in showing mutual respect and honor, they were to strive to excel; not to see which could obtain most honor, but which could confer most, or manifest most respect; compare <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>. Thus, they were to be studious to show to each other all the respect which was due in the various relations of life; children to show proper respect to parents, parents to children, servants to their masters, etc.; and all to strive by mutual kindness to promote the happiness of the Christian community. How different this from the spirit of the world; the spirit which seeks, not to confer honor, but to obtain it; which aims, not to diffuse respect, but to attract all others to give honor to us. If this single direction were to be obeyed in society, it would put an end at once to no small part of the envy, and ambition, and heartburning, and dissatisfaction of the world. It would produce contentment, harmony, love, and order in the community; and stay the progress of crime, and annihilate the evils of strife, and discord, and malice. And especially, it would give order and beauty to the church. It would humble the ambition of those who, like Diotrephes, love to have the pre-eminence <a href="//biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9</a>, and make every man willing to occupy the place for which God has designed him, and rejoice that his brethren may be exalted to higher posts of responsibility and honor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Be, &c.&#8212;better, "In brotherly love be affectionate one to another; in [giving, or showing] honor, outdoing each other." The word rendered "prefer" means rather "to go before," "take the lead," that is, "show an example." How opposite is this to the reigning morality of the heathen world! and though Christianity has so changed the spirit of society, that a certain beautiful disinterestedness and self-sacrifice shines in the character of not a few who are but partially, if at all under the transforming power of the Gospel, it is only those whom "the love of Christ constrains to live not unto themselves," who are capable of thoroughly acting in the spirit of this precept.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be kindly affectioned one to another; </span> Christians ought to have such affection one to another, as parents have to their children, and as all creatures have to their young: so much the word here used imports. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In honour preferring one another:</span> this clause is expounded by <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Philippians 2:3</a></span>.

Most desire preference and honour before others, which is contrary to the good counsel in this text. Some read it, prevent one another; do not tarry till others honour you, but do you go before them in this expression of <span class="ital">brotherly love, </span> and be examples to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love,.... This is one branch of that love, before advised to, which should be unfeigned, and without guile and deceit. The objects of this grace are "brethren", not in such sense as all the descendants of Adam are, or men of the same country be, or as such who are born of the same parents in a natural sense are; to each of whom love is due under their respective characters and relations: but such who are so in a spiritual sense, who are born of God, are of his household, belong to his family, are the brethren of Christ, and one another; and are either members of the same church, incorporated together in the same church state, or at least members of Christ, and of the church universal. Now love to these should be kind, tender, and affectionate, reciprocal and mutual; such should love one another; there should be no love wanting on either side; and it ought to be universal, and reach to all the saints, though of different gifts, light, knowledge and experience, or whether high or low, rich or poor; and should show itself by bearing one another's burdens, bearing with, and forbearing each other, forgiving one another, and by edifying one another in their most holy faith, and praying with, and for one another. <p>In honour preferring one another; saints should think honourably of one another, and entertain an honourable esteem of each other; yea, should esteem each other better thou themselves; and not indulge evil surmises, and groundless jealousies of one another, which is contrary to that love that thinks no evil. They should speak honourably of each other in Christian company, and discourage that evil practice of whisperings, backbitings, and innuendos; they should treat each other with honour and respect in their common conversation, and especially when met together as a church of Christ. They should go before each other in giving honour, and showing respect, as the word  signifies: they should set each other an example; and which also may be taken into the sense of the word, should prevent one another, not waiting until respect is shown on one side to return it again. Nor does this rule at all break in upon that order that should subsist, and be maintained in bodies civil and ecclesiastical, which requires superior honour to be given to persons according to their character, office, and station in which they are. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/12-10.htm" title="Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;">Romans 12:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῇ φιλαδελφ</span>] <span class="ital">In respect of</span> (in point of) <span class="ital">brotherly love</span> (love towards fellow-Christians, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm" title="Let brotherly love continue.">Hebrews 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2 Peter 1:7</a>).
