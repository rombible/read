It was expressly stated from the first that the promise was confined to a particular branch of his posterity. The posterity of Abraham, strictly so called, was to be that derived through Isaac. This is very nearly the sense of the original, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in “Isaac shalt thou have posterity, which shall be called thy posterity”—“true and legitimate descendants,” thus excluding the seed of Hagar.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:6-13 The rejection of the Jews by the gospel dispensation, did not break God's promise to the patriarchs. The promises and threatenings shall be fulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefits always found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according to the counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born in sin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselves they would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holy reasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, and to leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacob throws light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. The whole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christian and the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who are not the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement to diligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are they all children - Adopted into the true family of God.

This implied a selection, or choice; and therefore the doctrine of election was illustrated in the very commencement of the history of the nation; and as God had then made such a distinction, he might still do it.

And as Ishmael, though Abraham’s natural seed, was cast out, and therein was a type of those who are born only according to the flesh; so Isaac is a type of Abraham’s spiritual seed, who are born not of the power of nature, but by virtue of the promise of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither because they are the seed of Abraham,.... The Jews highly valued themselves, upon being the natural seed of Abraham; and fancied, upon this account, that they were children, which the apostle here denies: neither <p>are they all children; as in the former verse, he explains in what sense they were Israelites, which he had mentioned among their high characters and privileges, as descending from Jacob, and in what sense they were not; so in this he shows in what manner the "adoption", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>, belonged to them, and it did not; being Abraham's seed, they were his natural children, and the children of God by national adoption; but, they were not all the spiritual children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special grace of adoption; these characters only belonged to some of them, and which are equally true of Gentile believers; who being of the same faith with Abraham, are his children, his seed, and also the children of God: natural descent from Abraham avails nothing in this case, as is clear from the instance of Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the natural seed of Abraham, as well as Isaac; but he was not a son of Abraham in a spiritual sense, nor a child of God; he was not a child of promise, this was peculiar to Isaac: <p>but in Isaac shall thy seed be called; see <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>. The meaning of which is, either that the progeny of Abraham in the line of Isaac should only be called, accounted, and esteemed, in an eminent sense, the seed of Abraham, and not his posterity in the line of Ishmael: agreeably to which the Jews say (c), that <p>"Ishmael is not   , "in the general account of the seed of Abraham"; for it is said, "in Isaac shall thy seed be called", <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>; nor is Esau in the general account of the seed of Isaac; hence, says R. Joden bar Shalom, in Isaac, that is, in part of Isaac.'' <p>So another (d) of their writers, on mentioning this passage, observes, <p>"that it is said in Isaac,  , but "not all Isaac";'' <p>or all that sprung from him. Or this has respect to the most eminent and famous seed of Abraham, the Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth were to be blessed; who was to spring from him by Isaac, in the line of Jacob; and may likewise have a personal respect to Isaac himself, the son of the promise, a child of Abraham in a spiritual sense, when Ishmael was not; and to whom belonged the spiritual promises and blessings, and who was to be, and was effectually called by the grace of God; and may include also his whole seed and posterity, who, both natural and spiritual, were children of the typical promise, the land of Canaan, and the enjoyment of temporal good things; and the matter also children of the antitypical promise, or of those spiritual and eternal things, which God has promised to Abraham's spiritual seed, whether among Jews or Gentiles; and which always have their effect, and had, even when, and though Abraham's natural seed had a "lo ammi", <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>, written upon them. <p>(c) T.

In the original text we read <span class="greekheb">בְּיִצְחָק יִקָּרֵא לְךָ זָרַע</span>: through Isaac posterity shall be named to thee, i.e. through Isaac it will come to pass to thee, that posterity of thine shall have the status and the name of the <span class="greekheb">σπέρμα Ἀβρ</span>.

But <span class="ital">the apostle</span> has otherwise apprehended the sense of the passage according to its <span class="ital">typical</span> reference; for it is evident from the relation of <a href="/romans/9-9.htm" title="For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.">Romans 9:9</a> to <a href="/romans/9-8.htm" title="That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.">Romans 9:8</a>, that he <span class="ital">limited</span> that saying <span class="ital">to the person of Isaac himself</span>, who (not Ishmael) was the <span class="ital">promised</span> child of Abraham, and thus represented in himself the character of the true posterity of Abraham accounted as such by God. Hence, in the <span class="ital">sense of the apostle: “In the person of Isaac will a descendant be named to thee;” i.e</span>. Isaac will be he, in whose person the notion “descendant of Abraham” shall be represented and recognised. Paul finds in this divine declaration the idea enunciated (<a href="/romans/9-8.htm" title="That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.">Romans 9:8</a>), that not on bodily descent (which was also the case with Ishmael), but on divine promise (which was the case with Isaac, <a href="/romans/9-9.htm" title="For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.">Romans 9:9</a>), the true sonship of Abraham is founded. Usually (not by Philippi and Ewald, who concur with our view) the passage is understood, conformably to the historical sense of the original, not of the <span class="ital">person</span> of Isaac, but of his <span class="ital">posterity;</span> which, because Isaac himself was the son of promise, represents the true descendants of Abraham according to the promise. But to this posterity <span class="ital">all</span> Israelites certainly belonged, and it would therefore be inappropriate to set them down, by virtue of their extraction from Isaac, as the type of the true sonship of Abraham, when the very claim to that sonship, resting upon bodily descent, is to be withdrawn from them. The <span class="ital">person</span> of Isaac <span class="ital">himself</span>, as contrasted with Ishmael, was this type, which was thereupon repeated in Jacob, as contrasted with Esau (in their <span class="ital">persons</span>), <a href="/context/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;...">Romans 9:10-13</a>.
