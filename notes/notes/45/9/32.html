Yet they attained to righteousness by faith. Not by becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion, and submitting to the ceremonial law; but by embracing Christ, and believing in him, and submitting to the gospel. The Jews talked much of justification and holiness, and seemed very ambitious to be the favourites of God. They sought, but not in the right way, not in the humbling way, not in the appointed way. Not by faith, not by embracing Christ, depending upon Christ, and submitting to the gospel. They expected justification by observing the precepts and ceremonies of the law of Moses. The unbelieving Jews had a fair offer of righteousness, life, and salvation, made them upon gospel terms, which they did not like, and would not accept. Have we sought to know how we may be justified before God, seeking that blessing in the way here pointed out, by faith in Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness? Then we shall not be ashamed in that awful day, when all refuges of lies shall be swept away, and the Divine wrath shall overflow every hiding-place but that which God hath prepared in his own Son.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore? - Why? The apostle proceeds to state the reason why so uniform and remarkable a result happened. "They sought it not by faith, etc." They depended on their own righteousness, and not on the mercy of God to be obtained by faith.<p>By the works of the law - By complying with all the demands of the Law so that they might merit salvation. Their attempted obedience included their prayers, fastings, sacrifices, etc., as well as compliance with the demands of the moral law. It may be asked here, perhaps, how the Jews could know any better than this? how should they know anything about justification by faith? To this I:answer:<p>(1) That the doctrine was stated in the Old Testament; see <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>; compare <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/130-1.htm">Psalm 130:1-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3.htm">Romans 3</a>; <a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>.<p>(2) the sacrifices had reference to a future state of things, and were doubt less so understood; see the Epistle to the Hebrews.<p>(3) the "principle" of justification, and of living by faith, had been fully brought out in the lives and experience of the saints of old; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.<p>They stumbled - They fell; or failed; or "this was the cause why they" did not obtain it.<p>At that stumbling-stone - To wit, at what he specifies in the following verse. "A stumbling-stone" is a stone or impediment in the path over which people may fall. Here it means "that obstacle which prevented their attaining the righteousness of faith; and which was the occasion of their fall, rejection, and ruin." That was the rejection and the crucifixion of their own Messiah; their unwillingness to be saved by him; their contempt of him and his message. For this God withheld from them the blessings of justification, and was about to cast them off as a people. This also the apostle proceeds to prove was foretold by the prophets. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32, 33.

The question is asked, why they did not attain to that, which with so much diligence they pressed after? the answer is, because, as they did not seek for righteousness in a right place, or object, they sought for it in the law, and the works of it, where it is never to be found by a sinful creature, and not in Christ, in whom only are righteousness and strength; so they did not seek for it in a right way, by faith in Christ, without which it is impossible to please God, and by which only true righteousness is discerned and received: <p>but as it were by the works of the law; not by works which looked like works of the law, and were not; but they sought it as if they expected their justification before God was to be by works of righteousness done by them; or as if it was partly by their own works, and partly by the goodness of God, accepting of them for a justifying righteousness. The Alexandrian Copy, and some others, read only, "as it were by works"; and so does the Vulgate Latin version: another reason, or else a reason of the former is, <p>for they stumbled at that stumbling stone; meaning the word of the Gospel, at which Peter says they stumbled, and particularly the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ; or rather Christ himself, who was "to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness", <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore?

A result so confounding needs explanation. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως ἀλλʼ ὡς ἐξ ἔργων</span>: it seems too precise to supply with Weiss <span class="greekheb">ἐδίωξεν νόμον δικαιοσύνης</span>. The reason of Israel’s religious failure was that its whole religious effort and attitude was not of faith, but (so they conceived the case) of works. By inserting <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> Paul dissociates himself from this conception, and leaves it to Israel; he does not believe (having learned the contrary by bitter experience) that there is any outlet along this road. Everything in religion depends on the nature of the start. You may start <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως</span>, from an utter abandonment to God, and an entire dependence on Him, and in this case a righteousness is possible which you will recognise as <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ</span>, God’s own gift and work in you; or you may start <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span>, which really means in independence of God, and try to work out, without coming under obligation to God, a righteousness of your own, for which you may subsequently claim His approval, and in this case, like the Jews, all your efforts will be baffled. Your starting-point is unreal, impossible; it is not truly <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span>, but only <span class="greekheb">ὡ ς ἐξ ἔργων</span>; it is an idea of your own, not a truth on which life can be carried out, that you are in any sense independent of God. Such an idea, however, rooted in the mind, may effectually pervert and wreck the soul, by making the Divine way of attaining righteousness and life offensive to it; and this is what happened to the Jews. Because of that profoundly false relation to God <span class="greekheb">προσέκοψαν τῷ λίθῳ τοῦ προσκόμματος</span>. The stone on which they stumbled was Christ, and especially His Cross. The <span class="greekheb">σκάνδαλον</span> of the Cross, at which they stumbled, is not simply the fact that it <span class="ital">is</span> a cross, whereas they expected a Messianic throne; the Cross offended them because, as interpreted by Paul, it summoned them to begin their religious life, from the very beginning, at the foot of the Crucified, and with the sense upon their hearts of an infinite debt to Him, which no “works” could ever repay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore?</span>] See ch. 4 for the fullest commentary on this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as it were</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">as;</span> i.e. “<span class="ital">under the belief</span> that it could be so reached.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">works of the law</span>] “<span class="ital">Of the law</span>” should be omitted, on evidence of documents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that stumblingstone</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">the stumblingstone;</span> i.e. the Stone predicted, in the words now to be quoted.—“<span class="ital">Stumblingstone:</span>”—lit. <span class="bld">stone of stumbling</span>, as in E.

Here, as throughout the Epistle, the apostle's position is supported by an Old Testament reference. In this instance it is to two passages of Isaiah intermingled (Isaiah 28:16 and Isaiah 8:14). The way in which they are fused is illustrative of St. Paul's way, elsewhere apparent, of referring to Scripture. As a rule, he quotes the LXX., but often varies from it, and sometimes so as to be closer to the Hebrew. Sometimes he seems to be quoting from memory, as one who is familiar with the general drift of prophecy on the subject in hand, and satisfied if the form of his quotation expresses such general drift. In the ease before us, he follows the Hebrew in <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>:14, and the LXX. 2:28:16, where for the Hebrew expression rendered "shall not make haste," the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, apparently with the same essential meaning; for "make haste" seems to signify "haste away in terror and confusion." The two texts combined express the idea of a stone being laid by the Lord in Zion, which should be the support of the faithful, but a stumbling-block to others. It is not necessary to inquire whether the texts themselves have in the original any obvious Messianic reference. Enough that they denote God's plan of dealing with his people. But to understand the full idea in the apostle's mind, when he speaks of "the stone of stumbling," we must take into account also <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, and our Lord's language, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42, 44</a> and <a href="/luke/20-17.htm">Luke 20:17, 18</a>. In the Psalms we find the figure of "the stone" used thus: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head <span class="accented">stone</span> of the corner;" and in the Gospels our Lord refers to this text as de. noting himself, and subjoins, with reference to Isaiah, the idea of the same stone being one on which some should fall and be broken, with the additional conception of its crushing those on whom itself should fall. The same view essentially is expressed in Simeon's words (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>), that "this Child" should be for the fall as well as for the rising again of many in Israel; and it is repeated definitely in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Not by faith (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>A.V. and Rev. supply the ellipsis, they sought it not.<p>They stumbled (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>"In their foolish course Israel thought they were advancing on a clear path, and lo! all at once there was found in this way an obstacle upon which they were broken; and this obstacle was the very Messiah whom they had so long invoked in all their prayers" (Godet). </body></html>
