It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as Esaias said - <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>.<p>Before - The apostle had just cited one prediction from the tenth chapter of Isaiah. He now says that Isaiah had affirmed the same thing in a previous part of his prophecy.<p>Except the Lord of Sabaoth - In Isaiah, the Lord of Hosts. The word "Sabaoth" is the Hebrew word rendered "hosts" (armies). It properly denotes armies or military hosts organized for war. Hence, it denotes the "hosts of heaven," and means:<p>(1) "The angels" who are represented as marshalled or arranged into military orders; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>; Jde 1:6; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him;" <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>.<p>(2) the stars; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-22.htm">Jeremiah 33:22</a>, "As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, etc." <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, etc. God is called the Lord of hosts, as being at the head of all these armies; their King and their Commander. It is a phrase properly expressive of his majesty and power, and is appropriately introduced here, as the "act of saving" "the seed" was a signal "act of power" in the midst of great surrounding wickedness.<p>Had left - Had preserved, or kept from destruction. Here their preservation is ascribed to God, and it is affirmed that if God had not interposed, "the whole nation" would have been cut off. This fully establishes the doctrine of the apostle, that God might cast off the Jews, and extend the blessings to the Gentiles.<p>A seed - The Hebrew in Isaiah means "one surviving or escaping," corresponding with the word "remnant." The word "seed" commonly means in the Scriptures "descendants, posterity." In this place it means "a part, a small portion; a remnant," like the small portion of the harvest which is reserved for sowing.<p>We had been as Sodoma - The nation was so wicked, that unless God had preserved a small number who were pious from the general corruption of the people, they would have been swept off by judgment, like Sodom and Gomorrah. We are told that ten righteous men would have saved Sodom; <a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>. Among the Israelites, in a time of great general depravity, a small number of holy men were found who preserved the nation. The design of the apostle here was the same as in the previous verses - to show that it was settled in the Jewish history that God might cast off the people, and reject them from enjoying the special privileges of his friends. It is true that in Isaiah he has reference to the temporal punishments of the Jews. But it settles "a great principle," for which Paul was contending, that God might cast off the nation consistently with his promises and his plans. We may learn here,<p>(1) That the existence of religion among a people is owing to the love of God. "Except the Lord "had left us, etc."<p>(2) it is owing to his mercy that "any men" are kept from sin, and any nation from destruction.<p>(3) we see the value of religion and of pious people in a nation. Ten such would have saved Sodom; and a few such saved Judea; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13-14</a>.<p>(4) God has aright to withdraw his mercies from any other people, however exalted their privileges, and leave them to ruin; and we should not be high-minded, but fear; Rom, <a href="/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

He is Lord of the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, whom he brings forth by number, calls by their names, and them to praise him; of the angels, the multitude of the heavenly host, that do his pleasure, fight under him, and for him; and of the hosts of nations, of the several kingdoms of the world, who are all under his government, and among whom he acts according to his sovereign will and pleasure. Kimchi on the place says, he is called so, <p>"because of "the hosts above", and because of "the hosts below", who are the Israelites, that are called "hosts"; wherefore he would not consume us all, as we deserved:'' <p>no, according to the council of his own will, he left them "a seed"; or as it is in Isaiah, a very small remnant": and so the Syriac here,   a remnant"; both signify one and the same, namely, a few persons only: "a remnant" signifies a few, which remain out of a large number; and so does "seed", which is reserved for sowing again, after the whole stock is sold off, or consumed: and the leaving of this small number designs God's gracious acts of reserving in the election of a people for himself; the calling them by his grace in time, and preserving them from general corruption; which if he had not done among the Jews, as Jarchi on the text says, <p>"of himself, and by his mercies, and not for our righteousnesses,'' <p>we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha; the cities which God destroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven, for their iniquities: had it not been for electing grace, they would have been like the inhabitants of these cities for wickedness; and the case would have been the same with us and with the whole world, had it not been for God's act of election, choosing some to holiness here, and happiness hereafter. The decree of election is so far from being a door to licentiousness, that it is the true spring and source of all real holiness, that has been, or is in the world; and had it not been for this, there would have been no such thing as holiness in the world; and consequently not only Judea, but thee whole world, were it not for this, must have been long before now, like Sodom and Gomorrah, in their punishment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Sabaoth had left us a <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</span><p>(c) Armies, by which word the greatest power that exists is attributed to God.<p>(d) Even as very few.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/9-29.htm" title="And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like to Gomorrha.">Romans 9:29</a>.

The unbelief of the Jews was a great problem to the Apostolic age, and one which easily led to scepticism concerning the Gospel. The chosen people without a part in the kingdom of God—impossible. This chapter is Paul’s attempt to explain this situation as one not involving any unrighteousness or breach of faith on the part of God. It is not necessary to resume the various stages of the argument as they have been elucidated in the notes. The point of greatest difficulty is no doubt that presented by <a href="/context/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:...">Romans 9:22-23</a>. Many good scholars, Meyer and Lipsius for example, hold that Paul in these verses is not withdrawing from, but carrying through, the argument from God’s absoluteness stated so emphatically in <a href="/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>. They hold that the <span class="greekheb">σκεύη ὀργῆς κατηρτισμένα εἰς ἀπώλειαν</span> would not be <span class="greekheb">σκεύη ὀργῆς</span> at all, if their repentance and amendment were conceivable; and although God bears long with them—that is, defers their destruction—it is only in order that He may have time and opportunity to manifest the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy. But the answer to this is plain. It assumes that human life, in its relation to God, <span class="ital">can</span> be interpreted by the analogy of clay in its relation to the potter; in other words, that moral and spiritual experiences can be construed and made intelligible through what are merely physical categories. But this is not the case. And if it be said that justice is not done, by the interpretation given in this commentary, to the expression <span class="greekheb">σκεύη ὀργῆς</span>, it may also be said that justice is not done, by the interpretation of Meyer and Lipsius, to the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν πολλῇ μακροθυμίᾳ</span>. Each of these allegations may be said to neutralise the other—that is, neither is Iecisive for the interpretation of the passage; and the Apostle’s meaning remains to be determined by the general movement of his thought. In spite of the great difficulties of the section as a whole, I cannot hesitate to read it as above.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">And</span>] Q. d., “And again, the small number of Jewish believers fulfils another prediction.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">said before</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">hath said before;</span> i.e. “as <span class="ital">we have it</span> in his book.”—“<span class="ital">Before</span>” refers not to the quotation of an <span class="ital">earlier chapter</span>, but to the words as a <span class="ital">prediction</span>.

The force of all the above quotations is much enhanced, if we remember that they are not mere isolated texts, but suggestive specimens of many prophetic utterances to the same effect. All familiar with the prophetic writings are aware that main ideas constantly recurring are: First, judgments to come upon the chosen people, painted often in many consecutive verses without relief; but secondly, after such denunciations, a dawn of hope and comfort appearing, and culminating in unutterable blessing under the Messiah's kingdom; and thirdly, this dawn of hope being for a remnant only of the race, compared in one place to a gleaning of the grapes when the vintage is done (<a href="/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>); and fourthly, the association with this remnant, not only of the "outcasts of Israel" gathered from all lands, but also of a multitude of Gentiles, who should be gathered into the Messiah's kingdom (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>, etc.; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>; <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Said before (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Not in a previous passage, but by way of prediction.<p>Seed<p>Following the Septuagint, which thus renders the Hebrew remnant.
