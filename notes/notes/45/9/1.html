The apostle having insinuated, <a href="/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>, that God would cast off the Jews for their unbelief, a Jew is there supposed to object, that their rejection would destroy the faithfulness of God. To this the apostle answered, that the faithfulness of God would be established rather than destroyed, by the rejection of the Jews for their unbelief; because God had expressly declared, <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a>, that Abraham’s children were <span class="ital">to keep the way of the Lord, </span>in order to their obtaining the promised blessings; and had thereby insinuated, that if they did not keep that way they would lose blessings, of which their being made the visible Church of God was one. This was all the answer the apostle thought proper to make in that part of his epistle. But the objection being specious, and, it seems, much insisted on by the unbelieving Jews, he introduces it a second time in this place, that he might reply to it more fully: this then is the subject of this chapter. The apostle shows therein, in answer to the objection of his countrymen, that the rejection of the unbelieving Jews from being the Church of God, and the reception of the believing Gentiles to be his people in their stead, was not contrary to the word of God. That the apostle had not here the least thought of personal election or reprobation, is manifest, 1st, Because it lay quite wide of his design, which, as has been just observed, was merely to show that God’s rejecting the Jews, and receiving the Gentiles, was consistent with his word: 2d, Because such a doctrine would not only have had no tendency to convince, but would have evidently tended to harden the Jews: 3d, Because when he sums up his argument, in the close of the chapter, he says not one word, nor gives the least intimation about it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I say the truth in Christ </span>— This being a solemn appeal to Christ and the Holy Ghost, as knowing the apostle’s heart, for the truth of what he affirmed, it is of the nature of an oath. <span class="ital">I lie not </span>— That which he had in the former clause expressed in the affirmative, he in this emphatically confirms in the negative, according to the manner of the Hebrews, who were wont to deliver, as well negatively as affirmatively, what they judged to be worthy of special observation. <span class="ital">My conscience also bearing me witness </span>— As to the truth of what I say; <span class="ital">in the Holy Ghost </span>— Who searches all hearts, and perfectly knows whether the soul on which he operates be sincere. <span class="ital">That I have great heaviness, &c. </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">οτι λυπη μοι εστι μεγαλη</span>, <span class="greekheb">και αδιαλειπτος οδυνη τη καρδια μου</span>, <span class="ital">that I have great grief, and unceasing anguish in my heart </span>— This is the fact, the belief of which the apostle desired to procure by that solemnity of attestation expressed in the preceding verse: he does not here mention the cause of his grief and anguish, but it is evident from the first verse that the cause was their obduracy, and rejection as a nation, and the many miseries which he foresaw to be coming upon them. By thus declaring his sorrow for the unbelieving Jews, who excluded themselves from all the blessings he had enumerated in the former part of his epistle, he shows that what he was now about to say, he did not speak from any prejudice to them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I say the truth - In what I am about to affirm respecting my attachment to the nation and people.<p>In Christ - Most interpreters regard this as a form of an oath, as equivalent to calling Christ to witness. It is certainly to be regarded, in its obvious sense, as an appeal to Christ as the searcher of the heart, and as the judge of falsehood. Thus, the word translated "in" &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  en is used in the form of an oath in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>, Greek. We are to remember that the apostle was addressing those who had been Jews; and the expression has all the force of an oath "by the Messiah." This shows that it is right on great and solemn occasions, and in a solemn manner, and thus only, to appeal to Christ for the sincerity of our motives, and for the truth of what we say. And it shows further, that it is right to regard the Lord Jesus Christ as present with us, as searching the heart, as capable of detecting insincerity, hypocrisy, and perjury, and as therefore divine.<p>My conscience - Conscience is that act or judgment of the mind by which we decide on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our actions, and by which we instantly approve or condemn them. It exists in every man, and is a strong witness to our integrity or to our guilt.<p>Bearing me witness - Testifying to the truth of what Isay.<p>In the Holy Ghost - He does not say that he speaks the truth by or in the Holy Spirit, as he had said of Christ; but that the conscience pronounced its concurring testimony by the Holy Spirit; that is, conscience as enlightened and influenced by the Holy Spirit. It was not simply natural conscience, but it was conscience under the full influence of the Enlightener of the mind and Sanctifier of the heart. The reasons of this solemn asseveration are probably the following:<p>(1) His conduct and his doctrines had led some to believe that he was an apostate, and had lost his love for his countrymen. He had forsaken their institutions, and devoted himself to the salvation of the Gentiles. He here shows them that it was from no lack of love to them.<p>(2) the doctrines which he was about to state and defend were of a similar character; he was about to maintain that no small part of his own countrymen, notwithstanding their privileges, would be rejected and lost. In this solemn manner, therefore, he assures them that this doctrine had not been embraced because he did not love them, but because it was solemn, though most painful truth. He proceeds to enumerate their privileges as a people, and to show to them the strength and tenderness of his love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Ro 9:1-33.

The apostle being about to discourse concerning predestination, which he had mentioned in the preceding chapter, and to open the springs and causes of it, and also concerning the induration and rejection of the Jewish nation; he thought it necessary to preface his account of these things with some strong assurances of his great attachment to that people, and his affection for them, lest it should be thought he spoke out of prejudice to them; and well knowing in what situation he stood in with them, on account of his preaching up the abrogation of the ceremonial law, and how difficult it might be for him to obtain their belief in what he should say, he introduces it with a solemn oath, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not": which refers not to what he had said in the foregoing chapter, but to what he was going to say; and is all one as if he had said, as I am in Christ, a converted person, one born again, and renewed in the spirit of my mind, what I am about to speak is truth, and no lie; or I swear by Christ the God of truth, who is truth itself, and I appeal to him as the true God, the searcher of hearts, that what I now deliver is truth, and nothing but truth, and has no falsehood in it. This both shows that the taking of an oath is lawful, and that Christ is truly God, by whom only persons ought to swear: <p>my conscience bearing me witness. The apostle, besides his appeal to Christ, calls his conscience to witness to the truth of his words; and this is as a thousand witnesses; there is in every man a conscience, which unless seared as with a red hot iron, will accuse or excuse, and bear a faithful testimony to words and actions; and especially a conscience enlightened, cleansed, and sanctified by the Spirit of God, as was the apostle's: hence he adds, <p>in the Holy Ghost; meaning either that his conscience was influenced and directed by the Holy Ghost in what he was about to say; or it bore witness in and with the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost with that; so that here are three witnesses called in, Christ, conscience, and the Holy Ghost; and by three such witnesses, his words must be thought to be well established. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I say <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</span><p>(1) The third part of this epistle, which goes to the twelfth chapter, in which Paul ascends to the higher causes of faith: and first of all, because he purposed to speak much of the casting off of the Jews, he uses a declaration, saying by a double or triple oath, and by witnessing of his great desire towards their salvation, his singular love towards them, and in addition granting to them all their privileges.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,...">Romans 9:1-3</a>.] The new section is introduced without connection with the foregoing, but in a fervent outburst of Israelitish patriotism, the more sorrowful by contrast with the blessedness of the Christian previously extolled and so deeply experienced by the apostle himself. This sorrow might be deemed incredible, after the joyous triumph which had just been exhibited. Hence the extremely urgent asseveration with which he begins: <span class="ital">truth I speak in Christ</span>, that is, in my fellowship with Christ; <span class="greekheb">ἐν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Χ</span></span></span>. is the <span class="ital">element, in which</span> his soul moves.

(See also <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, I. § 26.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) The dedication of this large section to this special case is not out of proportion. Israel not only was immensely important as the Depositary of Revelation for ages past and the possessor as such of inestimable privileges, (<a href="/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;...">Romans 9:4-5</a>,) but at the time of St Paul it formed the vast majority of all professed believers in the God of Revelation. The unbelief of the great majority of Israel was therefore not only a distress to the Christian’s heart, but a perplexity to his mind, and so needed very special treatment and explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) He distinctly foretells a future of grace and mercy for Israel, on a grand scale of conversion. A time is to come when “blindness in part” is no longer to characterize Israel as a people; that is to say, a time when unbelief, if existing still at all, shall be the exception, not the rule.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) He does not touch on any other than the spiritual aspects of that future. As to the question of a political, or local, restoration of Israel, or both, he is entirely silent whether to affirm or deny; and so in all his Epistles. So it is also in all the N. T. Epistles. St Paul’s great object here is (1) to explain the spiritual alienation of the mass of Israelites, and (2) to open the prospect of its blessed reversal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Christ</span>] As a “member of Christ,” and so bound to inviolable truthfulness; and as speaking to other “members.” (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I lie not</span>] On this and similar appeals see on <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>.—The special reason for such words here is, perhaps, the thought that both Gentile Christians and unbelieving Jews (for different reasons) might think him now regardless of his earthly kindred, because so resolute in teaching the entire spiritual equality of all believers, Jew or Gentile. The Epistle might possibly be heard or read by unconverted Jews; and such words as these might reach their hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my conscience also bearing me witness</span>] Paul, as a man speaking to men, was corroborated (in his own consciousness) by Paul speaking to himself. <span class="ital">Word</span> and <span class="ital">conscience</span> coincided in statement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Holy Ghost</span>] Who, as the Sanctifier, pervades the conscience with new and intense light and sensibility.

But it was a subject too deeply fixed in St. Paul's mind to be left unnoticed. And besides, what he had said at the beginning of his treatise, and afterwards implied, seemed to call for some explanation in the face of existing facts. For he had said (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), that the gospel "was the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; <span class="accented">to the Jew first</span>, and also to the Gentile;" and throughout he has regarded it as the fulfilment of the peculiar promises made to the Jews themselves, who were to have precedence, though not monopoly, in the inheritance of its blessings. How, then, was this view consistent with the fact that the Jews in general, even more than any others, were now <span class="accented">excluded</span> from this inheritance? The apostle has already, even in the course of his argument, paused to meet certain supposed difficulties of this kind in the short section, <a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-8</a>; but now he takes up the whole subject formally, and considers it in all its bearings. First, in ch. 9, he expresses his deep sorrow for the fact; but shows it to be not inconsistent either with God's faithfulness to his promise, or with his justice, or with the Word of prophecy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost</span>.

The peculiar solemnity of this may be due to the peculiar depth of his feelings on the subject. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to suppose him to be moved by a fear of his patriotic enthusiasm being doubted, now that he had turned Christian, and argued so strongly against Jewish monopoly of privilege But it may have been so.
