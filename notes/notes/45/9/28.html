It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will finish the work - This is taken from the Septuagint translation of <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>. The Hebrew is, "The Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land." Or, as it may be rendered, "Destruction is decreed which shall make justice overflow; yea, destruction is verily determined on; the Lord Yahweh will execute it in the midst of all the land." (Stuart.) The Septuagint and the apostle adhere to "the sense" of the passage, but do not follow the words. The phrase, "will finish the work," means "he will bring the thing to an end," or will accomplish it. It is an expression applicable to a firm purpose to accomplish an object. It refers here to his threat of cutting off the people; and means that he will fulfil it.<p>Cut it short - This word here means to "execute it speedily." The destruction shall not be delayed.<p>In righteousness - So as to manifest his own justice. The work, though apparently severe, yet shall be a just expression of God's abhorrence of the sins of the people.<p>Because a short work - The word here rendered "short" means properly that which is "determined on or decreed." This is the sense of the Hebrew; and the phrase here denotes "the purpose which was determined on" in relation to the Jews.<p>Upon the earth - Upon the land of Israel; see the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>. The design for which the apostle introduces this passage is to show that God of old destroyed many of the Jews for their sin; and that, therefore, the doctrine of the apostle was no new thing, that "the Jews" might be excluded from the special privileges of the children of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. For he will finish the work, and cut&#8212;"is finishing the reckoning, and cutting it"<p>it short in righteousness; because a short work&#8212;"reckoning"<p>will the Lord make upon the earth&#8212;(Isa 10:22, 23), as in the Septuagint. The sense given to these words by the apostle may seem to differ from that intended by the prophet. But the sameness of sentiment in both places will at once appear, if we understand those words of the prophet, "the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness," to mean that while a remnant of Israel should be graciously spared to return from captivity, "the decreed consumption" of the impenitent majority should be "replete with righteousness," or illustriously display God's righteous vengeance against sin. The "short reckoning" seems to mean the speedy completing of His word, both in cutting off the one portion and saving the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse is also found in that forecited place, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm" title="For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.">Isaiah 10:22</a>,23</span>. The apostle in this, and in the other citations, follows the Seventy, which was a received translation, and had been in request about three hundred years, though in this, and in other places, it is very different from the Hebrew text. That which God is said to <span class="ital">finish, </span> and <span class="ital">cut short, </span> is his <span class="ital">work; </span> the Greek is logov, which signifies his word, or the account, as some read it. This is brought in as a reason why a remnant only should be saved; because God would shorten the acconnt, or (as we read it) make <span class="ital">a short work, </span> in the Jewish World. He would bring a sudden destruction upon that people. Sennacherib and the Assyrians, or Titus Vespasian and the Romans, shall make a complete and speedy conquest of them; few of them shall remain, the greater part being involved, first in infidelity, then in destruction. The apostle makes those few to be a type of God’s elect among that people, that should be saved by faith in Jesus Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he will finish the work,.... This passage has some difficulty in it: some, instead of "work", read "account", and suppose it is an allusion to the balancing of accounts, when the remainder is cut off, which commonly is but little; and so regards the small number of the Jews that shall be called and saved, as before: others read it "the word", and differently explain it; some understanding it of the incarnate Word, of his being emptied, and made of no reputation, of his being cut off in a very short time, a few years after he had entered upon his public ministry, and of the few persons converted under it; others of the law, of the cutting off, or abolishing the ceremonial law, perfecting or completing the moral law, and abbreviating it, or reducing it into a short compendium; others of the Gospel, bringing in and revealing a perfect righteousness, for the justification of sinners, which the law could not do; all foreign to the apostle's purpose. Those who think God's work, his strange work is meant, his work of punitive justice he will finish, <p>and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth, when he cut off and destroyed the greater part of the people of the Jews, and saved a remnant, seem to come nearer the mind of the prophet and the apostle's design, in citing this passage. The words as in Isaiah, I would choose to render and explain thus;  , "the absolute", or "precise degree", so Aben Ezra, interprets it, , "that which is decreed by God", the decree concerning the salvation of the remnant, , "he", i.e. God "shall cause to overflow in righteousness", <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, as an overflowing river; that is, he shall abundantly execute it, he shall completely fulfil it, to finish and cut it short in the most righteous manner, consistent with all his divine perfections;  , "for the decree and that determined", so Aben Ezra, , "the decree decreed" by God, "the Lord God of hosts",  "shall execute", accomplish, make short and full work of it, "in the midst of all the land", <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>, that is, of Judea: so that the words contain a most strong and invincible reason, why the remnant shall be saved; because God has made an absolute decree, concerning the salvation of it, which he will accomplish in the fullest manner, agreeably to his justice and holiness: the  or "word", the apostle from the prophet speaks of, that should be finished, and cut short and accomplished in righteousness, is the sentence, counsel, or decree, conceived in the divine mind, concerning this matter: hence as the decree of election stands firm and sure, not upon the works of men, but upon the absolute, sovereign, and efficacious will of God; so the salvation of his chosen people is not precarious, but a most sure and certain thing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he will finish the work, and cut <i>it</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</span><p>(b) God chooses and goes about to reduce the unkind and unthankful people to a very small number.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/9-28.htm" title="For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make on the earth.">Romans 9:28</a>. The Hebrew runs: <span class="greekheb">כִּלָּיוֹן חָרוּץ שֹׁטֵף צְדָקָה כִּי כָלָה וְנֶֽחֱרָצָה אֲדֹנָי יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת עֹשֶׂה בְּקֶרֶב כָּלּ־הָאָרֶץ</span>. Extirpation is decided, <span class="ital">streaming justice</span> (<span class="ital">i.e. penal justice</span>); <span class="ital">for extirpation and decision</span> (penal decision) <span class="ital">the Lord Jehovah Zebaoth makes</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> is on the point of executing) <span class="ital">in the midst of the whole earth</span> (on Zion). The LXX. did not understand these words, and translated them incorrectly (on how they came to do so, see Fritzsche, also Maier, in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. 1845, I. p. 190 f.). This cannot be denied; nor are we, with Olshausen, to attempt to conceal or smooth over the fact by arbitrary interpretation of the Hebrew. Paul has nevertheless felt no scruple in abiding by their translation with a few unimportant deviations, since its sense is not less suitable than that of the original to the connection and object which the declaration here subserves. The words, as Paul has them, mean: “<span class="ital">For utterance-accomplishing and</span> (as matter of fact, through a speedy execution of it) <span class="ital">shortcutting in righteousness</span> (is He); <span class="ital">for a short-cut utterance</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> a saying in which the whole penal decision is summarily included) <span class="ital">will the Lord bring to pass on the earth</span>.” In reference to single expressions, remark: (1) <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span>, which belongs to both participles, is neither <span class="ital">decree</span> (usually so taken, but this is not its meaning), nor <span class="ital">matter of fact</span> (Beza, Melancthon, Castalio, Calvin, Koppe, Reithmayr, formerly also Hofmann, Weissag. u. Erf. II. p. 213, and various others), which it never denotes with Paul, nor <span class="ital">reckoning</span>, which, in connection with <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span>, would be contrary to idiom, but <span class="ital">dictum</span>, an <span class="ital">utterance</span>, which He has delivered; and this indeed, in the first clause of the verse, which expresses the executive justice of God <span class="ital">in general</span>, is to be understood quite generally; comp. Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.: “quicquid dixit, plene praestet et quidem compendio.” In the second clause, on the other hand, which adduces proof of that general description of God with the <span class="ital">concrete case</span>, the occurrence of which is predicted, <span class="ital">the divine saying of <a href="/romans/9-27.htm" title="Esaias also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:">Romans 9:27</a></span>, <span class="ital">delivered through the prophet</span>, is intended. (2) <span class="greekheb">συντέμνειν</span>, used of something that is said (speeches, answers, and the like), like <span class="greekheb">συναιρεῖν</span>, never denotes in Greek anything else than <span class="ital">to cut short</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Protag</span>. p. 334 D, <span class="ital">Ephesians 3</span>, p. 318 B; Aeschines, p. 32. 23; Euripides, <span class="ital">Iph. A</span>. 1249, <span class="ital">Aeol. fr</span>. v. 2; Lucian, <span class="ital">bis. accus</span>. 28; Soph. <span class="ital">fragm</span>. 411, Dind.; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/10-10.htm" title="Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the wars.">2Ma 10:10</a>; Pflugk, <span class="ital">ad Eur. Hec</span>. 1180), and it is therefore inadmissible to depart from this signification of the <span class="greekheb">συντομία λόγων</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Phaedr</span>. p. 267 B). We must, however, observe that in <span class="greekheb">συντέμνων</span> this “<span class="ital">comprising in short</span>” must be <span class="ital">a matter of fact</span>, consisting in the short summary despatch of the matter (comp. LXX. <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a>; Eur. <span class="ital">Rhes</span>. 450), like our “<span class="ital">cut it short;</span>” while, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">συντετμημένον</span> (<span class="ital">perfect</span>) refers to the concise, short, and stern style in which <span class="ital">the saying itself</span> is conceived (<span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπόλειμμα σωθήσεται</span>!). Passages in which <span class="greekheb">συντέμνειν</span> denotes <span class="ital">overtake</span> and the like (as Soph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. 1090) have no bearing on the present one. Neither are we to adopt what Tholuck reads into it, that God will accomplish the promise delivered in <a href="/context/isaiah/10-20.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay on him that smote them; but shall stay on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth....">Isaiah 10:20-21</a>, <span class="ital">only with great limitation of the number of the people</span>, which would, besides, be not at all suitable to the perfect participle <span class="greekheb">συντετμημένον</span>. Moreover, the LXX. cannot have meant <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> of the word of promise, but, according to the sense of the original, only of the penal judicial declaration. (3) <span class="greekheb">ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ</span> does not stand for the <span class="ital">righteousness of faith</span> (Fritzsche), but is to be referred, according to the context, as in the Hebrew, to the judicial <span class="ital">righteousness</span> of God. (4) The participles <span class="greekheb">συντετ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">συντέμνων</span> require only <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> to be supplied. See Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. p. 776; Bernhardy, p. 470; Kühner, II. 1, p. 37. And (5) as respects the argumentative force of the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, it lies in the fact that, if God causes such a penal judgment to be issued on Israel, the part of the people remaining spared, which obtains salvation, can only be the <span class="greekheb">ὑπόλειμμα</span> out of the mass, that which <span class="ital">remains over. </span>Incorrectly Hofmann, in accordance with his erroneous interpretation of <a href="/context/romans/9-27.htm" title="Esaias also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:...">Romans 9:27-28</a>, explains: So long as this present world-period endures, Israel’s final salvation might remain in suspense; “<span class="ital">but Jehovah leaves it not on this footing, He makes an end, and settles accounts with the world, and the remnant which is then Israel’s people returns to Him and attains to salvation</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">for he will finish</span>, &c.] These words agree closely with the letter of the LXX., but not with that of the Heb.
