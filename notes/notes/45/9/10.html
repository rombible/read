It also appeared when Rebecca bore sons to Isaac. It was indeed <span class= "ital">pure</span> selection. The children themselves had done nothing to make a preference be given to one over the other. There was no merit in the case. The object of the declaration was to ratify the divine electing purpose which had already chosen Jacob to be the inheritor of the Messianic blessings.<p>Here we have the doctrine of election and predestination stated in a very unqualified and uncompromising form. And it does indeed necessarily follow from one train of thought. However much we lay stress on freewill, still actions are the result of character—the will itself is a part of character; and character is born in us. Of the two elements which go to determine action, outward circumstances, and inward disposition, neither can be said strictly to be made by the man himself. If we follow this train of thought, then it would certainly appear that God, or the chain of natural causes set in motion and directed by God, made him what he is. In other words, he is elected and predetermined to a certain line of conduct. This is the logic of one set of inferences. On the other hand, the logic of the other set of inferences is just as strong—that man is free. There is an opposition irreconcilable to us with our present means of judging. We can only take the one proposition as qualified by the other.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:6-13 The rejection of the Jews by the gospel dispensation, did not break God's promise to the patriarchs. The promises and threatenings shall be fulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefits always found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according to the counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born in sin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselves they would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holy reasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, and to leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacob throws light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. The whole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christian and the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who are not the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement to diligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And not only this - Not only is the principle of making a distinction among the natural descendants of Abraham thus settled by the promise, but it is still further seen and illustrated in the birth of the two sons of Isaac. He had shown that the principle of thus making a distinction among the posterity of Abraham was recognised in the original promise, thus proving that all the descendants of Abraham were not of course to be saved; and he now proceeds to show that the principle was recognised in the case of his posterity in the family of Isaac. And he shows that it is not according to any natural principles that the selection was made; that he not only made a distinction between Jacob and Esau, but that he did it according to his good pleasure, choosing the younger to be the object of his favor, and rejecting the older, who, according to the custom of the times, was supposed to be entitled to special honor and rights. And in order to prove that this was done according to his own pleasure, he shows that the distinction was made before they were born; before they had formed any character; and, consequently, in such a way that it could not be pretended that it was in consequence of any works which they had performed.<p>But when Rebecca - The wife of Isaac; see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>, <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13.

But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife; for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a ground of preference: and all to show that the sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God&#8212;"not of works, but of Him that calleth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And not only this; </span> some read it, And not only she; the particle <span class="ital">this</span> is not in the Greek. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac:</span> this instance is added, because there might be some objection against the former; as if there were some reason why God chose Isaac, and refused Ishmael. Isaac was born of a free-woman, and when Abraham was uncircumcised: besides, Ishmael no sooner came to years, but he showed some tokens of perverseness, and of a wicked spirit. Therefore, in this and the three following verses, he gives another, which was beyond all exception; and that is in Esau and Jacob, betwixt whom there was no disparity, either in birth or in works: they had both one and the same mother; Rebecca conceived with them at one and the same time, and that by no other person than our father Isaac; and yet the one of these is chosen, and the other refused. Tills now was an undeniable proof, that the promise belongs not to all the children of Abraham, or of Isaac, according to the flesh; all the seed of neither are the children of the promise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And not only this,....

The apostle was aware, that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of Ishmael and Isaac was not a pertinent one; since Ishmael was not born of Sarah, the lawful wife of Abraham, but of a bondwoman, which was the reason his rejection, when Isaac was the son of promise, by the lawful wife, and that they were children of Abraham in the line of Isaac, and so children of the promise, as he was: wherefore he proceeds to mention the case of Jacob and Esau, which was not liable to any such exception; seeing they not only had the same father, but the same mother, Isaac's lawful wife; they were conceived by Rebecca at once, were in the same womb together, were twins, and if any had the preference and advantage, Esau had it, being born first; and yet a difference was made between these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before either were born. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> And not only <i>this</i>; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <i>even</i> by our father Isaac;</span><p>(7) Another strong and persuasive proof taken from the example of Esau and Jacob, who were both born of the same Isaac, who was the son of promise of one mother, and were born at the same time, and not at different times as Ishmael and Isaac were: and yet nonetheless, as Esau was cast off, only Jacob was chosen: and that before their birth, that neither any goodness of Jacob's might be thought to be the cause of his election, neither any wickedness of Esau to be the cause of his casting away.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;">Romans 9:10</a>.

If Isaac were to be designated as the father of <span class="ital">Christians</span> (Reiche, Fritzsche), the context must have necessarily and definitely indicated this, since believers are <span class="ital">Abraham’s</span> (spiritual) children. We may add that <span class="greekheb">Ἰς</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πατρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> is not without a significant bearing on the argument, inasmuch as it contributes to make us feel the independence of the determination of the divine will on the theocratic descent, however legitimate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;">Romans 9:10</a> ff. But the argument can be made more decisive. A Jewish opponent might say, “Ishmael was an illegitimate child, who naturally had no rights as against Isaac; we are the legitimate descendants of the patriarch, and our right to the inheritance is indefeasible”. To this the Apostle replies in <a href="/context/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;...">Romans 9:10-13</a>. Not only did God make the distinction already referred to, but in the case of <span class="ital">Isaac’s</span> children, where there seemed no ground for making any distinction whatever, He distinguished again, and said, The elder shall serve the younger. Jacob and Esau had one father, one mother, and were twin sons; the only ground on which either could have been preferred was that of priority of birth, and this was disregarded by God; Esau, the elder, was rejected, and Jacob, the younger, was made heir of the promises. Further, this was done by God of His sovereign freedom: the decisive word was spoken to their mother while they were as yet unborn and had achieved neither good nor evil. Claims as of right, therefore, made against God, are futile, whether they are based on descent or on works. There is no way in which they can be established; and, as we have just seen, God acts in entire disregard of them. God’s purpose to save men, and make them heirs of His kingdom—a purpose which is characterised as <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐκλογήν</span>, or involving a choice—is not determined at all by consideration of such claims as the Jews put forward. In forming it, and carrying it out, God acts with perfect freedom. In the case in question His action in regard to Jacob and Esau agrees with His word in the prophet Malachi: Jacob I loved but Esau I hated; and further than this we cannot go. To avoid misapprehending this, however, it is necessary to keep the Apostle’s purpose in view. He wishes to show that God’s promise has not broken down, though many of the children of Abraham have no part in its fulfilment in Christ. He does so by showing that there has always been a distinction, among the descendants of the patriarchs, between those who have merely the natural connection to boast of, and those who are the Israel of God; and, as against Jewish pretensions, he shows at the same time that this distinction can be traced to nothing but God’s sovereignty. It is not of works, but of Him Who effectually calls men. We may say, if we please, that sovereignty in this sense is “just a name for what is <span class="ital">unrevealed</span> of God” (T. Erskine, <span class="ital">The Brazen Serpent</span>, p. 259), but though it is unrevealed we must not conceive of it as arbitrary—<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, as non-rational or non-moral. It is the sovereignty of <span class="ital">God</span>, and God is not <span class="ital">exlex</span>; He is a law to Himself—a law all love and holiness and truth—in all His purposes towards men. So Calvin: “ubi mentionem gloriæ Dei audis, illic justitiam cogita”. Paul has mentioned in an earlier chapter, among the notes of true religion, the exclusion of boasting (<a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.">Romans 3:27</a>); and in substance that is the argument he is using here. No Jewish birth, no legal works, can give a man a claim which God is bound to honour; and no man urging such claims can say that God’s word has become of no effect though his claims are disallowed, and he gets no part in the inheritance of God’s people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον δέ</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>, <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a> = Not only is this so, but a more striking and convincing illustration can be given. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ Ῥεβέκκα</span>: the sentence thus begun is never finished, but the sense is continued in <a href="/romans/9-12.htm" title="It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.">Romans 9:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν</span>: Paul speaks here out of his own consciousness as a Jew, addressing himself to a problem which greatly exercised other Jews; and calls Isaac “father” as the person from whom the inheritance was to come. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">And not only this</span>] Here a still stronger example of sovereign choice occurs.
