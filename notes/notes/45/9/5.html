Trinitarian and English interpreters, as a rule, take them with the punctuation of the Authorised version, as referring to Christ. Socinian interpreters, with some of the most eminent among the Germans, put a full stop after “came,” and make the remainder of the verse a doxology addressed to God, “Blessed for ever be God, who is over all.” Both ways are possible. The question is, Which is the most natural and probable? and this is to be considered, putting altogether on one side prepossessions of every kind. We are not to read meaning <span class= "ital">into</span> Scripture, but to elicit meaning <span class= "ital">from</span> it. The balance of the argument stands thus:—(1) The order of the words is somewhat in favour of the application to Christ. If the clause had really been a formal doxology, the ascription of blessing would more naturally have come at the beginning in Greek as in English, “Blessed be God,” &c. (2) The context is also somewhat in favour of this application. The break in the form of the sentence becomes rather abrupt on the other hypothesis, and is not to be quite paralleled. Intruded doxologies, caused by a sudden access of pious feeling, are not uncommon in the writings of St. Paul, but they are either worked into the regular order of the sentence, as in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>, or else they are formally introduced as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1Timothy 1:17</a>. (3) But on the other hand, to set somewhat decidedly against this application, is the fact that the words used by the Apostle, “Who is over all,” and the ascription of blessing in all other places where they occur, are referred, not to Christ, but to God. (Comp. <a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm" title="One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.">Ephesians 4:6</a>.) There is, indeed, a doxology addressed to Christ in <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2Timothy 4:18</a>; it should, however, be remembered that the Pauline origin of that Epistle has been doubted by some, though it is also right to add that these doubts do not appear to have any real validity. The title “God” does not appear to be elsewhere applied to our Lord by St. Paul, though all the attributes of Godhead are ascribed to Him: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> In <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, which would be an apparent exception, the true reading is, * Who was manifested,” and not “God was manifested.” On the other hand, St. John certainly makes use of this title, not only in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>, but also in the reading, adopted by many, of <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, “God only begotten” for “Only begotten Son.” Weighing the whole of the arguments against each other, the <span class= "ital">data</span> do not seem to be sufficient to warrant a positive and dogmatic conclusion either way. The application to our Lord appears perhaps a little the more probable of the two. More than this cannot be said. Nor is a stronger affirmation warranted by any considerations resting on the division of authorities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.

And this can be none other but the divine nature; which, in the sequel of the verse, is expressly attributed to him. The apostle reserves the mention of Christ’s descent from the Jews for the last of their prerogatives, as being the greatest of them all: <span class="ital">who is over all, God, </span>&c. — The apostle gives this, so highly honourable a testimony to Christ, because he was so vilified by the Jews; thus making up that great breach, so to speak, which they had made on his name and honour by their unbelief, and wicked rejection of him. He is said to be <span class="ital">over all, </span>1st, Because, as he was God-Man and Mediator, <span class="ital">all power was given unto him in heaven and on earth, </span><a href="/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a>; <span class="ital">all things delivered into his</span> <span class="ital">hands, and put under his feet, </span><a href="/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

And more especially, 2d, Because as <span class="ital">God, </span>possessed of true, essential deity, he was in union with his Father and the Holy Spirit, <span class="ital">supreme over all, </span>and consequently <span class="ital">blessed for ever </span>— Which words he adds to show, that a far different measure from that which the Jews had hitherto measured out unto Christ, was due to him from them, as from all other men. No words can more clearly express his divine, supreme majesty, and his gracious sovereignty over both Jews and Gentiles. The apostle closes all with the word, <span class="ital">amen </span>— An expression commonly used for a serious confirmation of what is said immediately before, together with an approbation of it; sometimes also importing a desire for the performance thereof. Some would persuade us that the true reading of this clause is, <span class="greekheb">ων ο επι παντων θεος</span>, <span class="ital">whose is the God over all; </span>because by this reading, they say, the climax is completed; and the privilege in which the Jews gloried above all others, (namely, that of having the true God for their God,) is not omitted. “But as this reading,” says Macknight, “is found in no copy whatever, it ought not to be admitted on conjecture.” Thus also Doddridge: “How ingenious soever that conjecture may be thought, by which some would read this, <span class="ital">whose is the God over all, </span>to answer to, <span class="ital">whose are the fathers, </span>I think it would be extremely dangerous to follow this reading, unsupported as it is by any critical authority of manuscripts or ancient quotations. Nor can I find any authority for rendering <span class="greekheb">Θεος ευλογητος εις τους αιωνας</span>, <span class="ital">God be blessed for ever. </span>I must, therefore, consider this memorable text as a proof of Christ’s proper deity, which, I think, the opposers of that doctrine have never been able, nor will ever be able to answer. Though common sense must teach, what Christians have always believed, that it is not with respect to the <span class="ital">Father, </span>but to the created world that this august title is given to him:” that is, that he is said to be <span class="ital">God over all.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose are the fathers - Who have been honored with so illustrious an ancestry.

There are no various readings in the Greek manuscripts of any consequence; and the connection here evidently requires us to understand this of a nature that is not "according to the flesh," i. e., as the apostle here shows, of the divine nature.<p>God blessed forever - This is evidently applied to the Lord Jesus; and it proves that he is divine. If the translation is fairly made, and it has never been proved to be erroneous, it demonstrates that he is God as well as man. The doxology "blessed forever" was usually added by the Jewish writers after the mention of the name God, as an expression of reverence. (See the various interpretations that have been proposed on this passage examined in Prof. Stuart's Notes on this verse.)<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Whose are the fathers&#8212;here, probably, the three great fathers of the covenant&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;by whom God condescended to name Himself (Ex 8:6, 13; Lu 20:37).<p>and&#8212;most exalted privilege of all, and as such, reserved to the last.<p>of whom as concerning the flesh&#8212;(See on [2238]Ro 1:3).<p>Christ came&#8212;or, "is Christ"<p>who is over all, God&#8212;rather, "God over all."<p>blessed for ever. Amen&#8212;To get rid of the bright testimony here borne to the supreme divinity of Christ, various expedients have been adopted: (1) To place a period, either after the words "concerning the flesh Christ came," rendering the next clause as a doxology to the Father&#8212;"God who is over all be blessed for ever"; or after the word "all"&#8212;thus, "Christ came, who is over all: God be blessed.", &c. [Erasmus, Locke, Fritzsche, Meyer, Jowett, &c.]. But it is fatal to this view, as even Socinus admits, that in other Scripture doxologies the word "Blessed" precedes the name of God on whom the blessing is invoked (thus: "Blessed be God," Ps 68:35; "Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel," Ps 72:18). Besides, any such doxology here would be "unmeaning and frigid in the extreme"; the sad subject on which he was entering suggesting anything but a doxology, even in connection with Christ's Incarnation [Alford]. (2) To transpose the words rendered "who is"; in which case the rendering would be, "whose (that is, the fathers') is Christ according to the flesh" [Crellius, Whiston, Taylor, Whitby]. But this is a desperate expedient, in the face of all manuscript authority; as is also the conjecture of Grotius and others, that the word "God" should be omitted from the text. It remains then, that we have here no doxology at all, but a naked statement of fact, that while Christ is "of" the Israelitish nation "as concerning the flesh," He is, in another respect, "God over all, blessed for ever." (In 2Co 11:31 the very Greek phrase which is here rendered "who is," is used in the same sense; and compare Ro 1:25, Greek). In this view of the passage, as a testimony to the supreme divinity of Christ, besides all the orthodox fathers, some of the ablest modern critics concur [Bengel, Tholuck, Stuart, Olshausen, Philippi, Alford, &c.]<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whose are the fathers; </span> who are lineally descended of the holy patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with other holy fathers and prophets, and of the same blood.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for, according to the (a) Jewish writers, <p>"they call none in Israel  "fathers", but three, and they are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and they call none "mothers" but four, and they are, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah:'' <p>their descent from these fathers was a privilege, though they valued themselves too highly upon it; but what was the crown and glory of all, and which they took the least, though the apostle took the most notice of, is, <p>and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came; that is, either of the fathers, or of the Israelites, from whom Christ, according to his human nature, sprung; being a son of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the seed of David, and the son of Mary; hence the Messiah is called , "the Messiah or Christ of Israel" (b): <p>who is described as <p>over all, angels and men, being the creator, upholder, and governor of them; and as having another nature, a divine one, being <p>God, truly and properly God, <p>blessed for evermore; in himself, and to be blessed and praised by all creatures. The apostle alludes to that well known periphrastic name of God so much used by the Jews,  , "the holy, blessed God"; to which, by way of assent and confirmation, the apostle puts his <p>Amen. Now all these particular privileges are mentioned by him, as what heightened his concern for these people; it filled him with heaviness and sorrow of heart, when he considered, that persons who had been partakers of such favours, and especially the last, that the Messiah should spring from them, be born of them, and among them, and yet that they should be given up to ruin and destruction. <p>(a) T.

So, substantially, Irenaeus (<span class="ital">Haer</span>. iii. 16. 3), Tertullian (<span class="ital">adv. Prax</span>. § 13, p. 2101, ed. Seml.), Origen, Cyprian, Epiphanius, Athanasius, Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Augustine, Jerome, Theodoret, and later Fathers; Luther, Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>., Flacius, Calvin, Beza, and most of the older expositors; and of the later, Michaelis, Koppe, Tholuck, Flatt, Klee, Usteri, Benecke, Olshausen, Nielsen, Reithmayr, Maier, Beck, Philippi, Bisping, Gess, Krummacher, Jatho, Hahn, Thomasius, Ebrard, Ritschl, Hofmann, Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol</span>. p. 306, Delitzsch, and others; in a peculiar fashion also, Herm. Schultz (see below); de Wette is undecided. (2) The words are regarded (placing a period after <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span>, as do Lachm. and Tisch.) as a <span class="ital">doxology to God</span>, isolated from the foregoing: “<span class="ital">Blessed for ever be the God who is over all</span>.” So none of the Fathers (as to those erroneously adduced by Wetstein, see Fritzsche, p. 262 ff.), at least not expressly; but Erasmus in his <span class="ital">Annot</span>., Wetstein, Semler, Stolz, and several others, and recently Reiche, Köllner, Winzer, Fritzsche, Glöckler, Schrader, Krehl, Ewald, van Hengel, and, though not fully decided, Rückert. See also Baur, II. p. 231; Zeller, in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. 1842, p. 51; Räbiger, <span class="ital">Christol. Paul</span>. p. 26 f.; Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol</span>. p. 210. Now the decision, which of the two leading interpretations fits <span class="ital">the meaning of the apostle</span>, cannot be arrived at from the language used, since, so far as the words go, both may be equally correct; nor yet from the immediate connection, since with equal reason Paul might (by no means: <span class="ital">must</span>, against which is the analogy of <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>; and the divine in Christ did not belong here, as in <a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>, <span class="ital">necessarily</span> to the connection) feel himself induced to set over-against the human side of the being of Jesus its divine side (as in <a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>), or might be determined by the recital of the distinctions of his nation to devote a doxology to God, the Author of these privileges, who therefore was not responsible for the deeply-lamented unbelief of the Jews; just as he elsewhere, in peculiar excited states of piety, introduces a giving glory to God (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>; comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a>). Observe, rather, with a view to a decision, the following considerations: Although our passage, referred to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, would term Him not <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>, but (<span class="ital">who is God over all</span>) only <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> predicatively (<span class="ital">without</span> the article), and although Paul, by virtue of his essential agreement in <span class="ital">substance</span> with the Christology of John, might have affirmed, just as appropriately as the latter (<a href="/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>), the predicative <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> (<span class="ital">of divine essence</span>) of Christ, because Christ is also in Paul’s view the Son of God in a metaphysical sense, the image of God, of like essence with the Father, the agent in creation and preservation, the partaker in the divine government of the world, the judge of all, the object of prayerful invocation, the possessor of divine glory and fulness of grace (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, <a href="/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> ff; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a> ff.; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>); yet Paul has <span class="ital">never</span> used the express <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> of Christ, since he has not adopted, like John, the Alexandrian form of conceiving and setting forth the divine essence of Christ, but has adhered to the popular concrete, strictly monotheistic terminology, not modified by philosophical speculation even for the designation of Christ; and he always accurately distinguishes God and Christ; see, in opposition to such obscure and erroneous intermingling of ideas, Rich. Schmidt, <span class="ital">Paulin. Christol</span>. p. 149 ff. John himself calls the divine nature of Christ <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> only in the introduction of his Gospel, and only in the closest connection with the Logos-speculation. And thus there runs through the whole N. T. a delicate line of separation between the Father and the Son; so that, although the divine essence and glory of the latter is glorified with the loftiest predicates in manifold ways, nevertheless it is only the Father, to whom the Son is throughout subordinated, and never Christ, who is actually called <span class="ital">God</span> by the apostles (with the exception of <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, and the exclamation of Thomas, <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>)—not even in <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1 John 5:20</a>. Paul, particularly, even where he accumulates and strains to the utmost expressions concerning the Godlike nature of the exalted Christ (as <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a> ff.; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> ff; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>), does not call Him <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>, but sharply and clearly distinguishes Him as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΡΙΟς</span></span></span> from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΌς</span></span></span>, even in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> (in opposition to Ritschl, <span class="ital">Altkath. K</span>. p. 79 f.). The post-apostolical period (and not at all <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a>, see Huther) first obliterated this fine line of separation, and often denominated Christ <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν</span>, and the like. So, <span class="ital">e.g</span>., already several of the Ignatian epistles in the shorter recension (not those <span class="ital">ad Magnes., ad Philadelph., ad Trall</span>., not even chap. 7) and the so-called second epistle—not the first—of Clement, nor the epistle of Polycarp. In the closest internal connection herewith stands the fact, that in the properly apostolical writings (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2 Peter 3:18</a> does not belong to them, nor does <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>) we never meet with a doxology to Christ in the form which is usual with doxologies to God (not even in <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Peter 4:11</a>); therefore, in this respect also, the present passage would stand to the <span class="ital">apostolic</span> type in the relation of a complete <span class="ital">anomaly</span>. Besides, the insuperable difficulty would be introduced, that here Christ would be called not merely and simply <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>, but even <span class="ital">God over all</span>, and consequently would be designated as <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς παντοκράτωρ</span>, which is absolutely incompatible with the entire view of the N. T. as to the dependence of the Son on the Father (see Gess, <span class="ital">v. d. Pers. Chr</span>. p. 157 ff.; Kahnis, <span class="ital">Dogm</span>. I. p. 457 ff.), and especially with passages like <a href="/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἐντυγχάνει</span>), <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, <a href="/context/ephesians/4-5.htm" title="One Lord, one faith, one baptism,...">Ephesians 4:5-6</a>, and notably <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>. Accordingly, the doxology of our passage cannot be referred to Christ, but must be referred <span class="ital">to God;</span> although Philippi continues of opinion that the <span class="ital">former</span> reference has <span class="ital">all</span> in its favour and <span class="ital">nothing</span> against it. On the other hand, Tholuck (see also Schmid, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol</span>. II. p. 540, ed. 2) does more justice to the objections against the old ecclesiastical interpretation, which Messner also, <span class="ital">Lehre d. Ap</span>. p. 236 f., prefers, but only with a certain diffidence; whilst Herm. Schultz (comp. Socinus, in Calovius, p. 153) comes ultimately to <span class="ital">a lower acceptation of the notion of</span> <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>, which is meant <span class="ital">not metaphysically</span>, but only <span class="ital">designates the fulness of power committed to Christ for behoof of His work, and excludes neither dependence and coming into being, nor beginning and end</span>. Against the latter suggestion it may be decisively urged, that thus characteristics are attached to the notion <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>, which, compared with the current Pauline mode of expression, directly annul it, and make it interchangeable with <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>, as Paul uses it of Christ (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-5.htm" title="One Lord, one faith, one baptism,...">Ephesians 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Php 2:11</a>; <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the fathers</span>] Cp. <a href="/romans/11-28.htm" title="As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.">Romans 11:28</a>. The reference is probably specially to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But David is also “the <span class="ital">patriarch</span> David;” <a href="/acts/2-29.htm" title="Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.">Acts 2:29</a>.—These sacred Persons are now mentioned, after the previous sacred Things, so as to usher in the mention of the Christ Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of whom</span>] <span class="bld">out of whom;</span> not merely “<span class="ital">whose</span>,” as in previous clauses; perhaps to keep the thought in view that He was not exclusively <span class="ital">for</span> Israel, though wholly <span class="ital">of</span> Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as concerning the flesh</span>] In respect of His human Parent’s descent He also was Jewish. His blessed Humanity was indeed, on the Paternal side, “of God;” (Meyer;) but this distinction is not in view here, where the plain meaning is that, by human parentage, He was Jewish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who is over all, God blessed for ever</span>] The Gr. may (with more or less facility) be translated, (1) as in E. V.; or (2) <span class="bld">who is God over all</span>, &c.;” or (3) <span class="bld">blessed for ever [be] the God who is over all</span>. Between (1) and (2) the practical difference is slight, but (1) is the easier and safer grammatically: between (3) and the others the difference is, of course, complete. If we adopt (3) we take the Apostle to be led, by the mention of the Incarnation, to utter a sudden doxology to the God who gave that crowning mercy. In favour of this view it is urged, (not only by Socinian commentators and the like, but by some of the orthodox, as Meyer,) that St Paul nowhere else styles the Lord simply “God;” but always rather “the Son of God,” &c. By this they do not mean to deny or detract from the Lord’s Deity, but they maintain that St Paul always so states that Deity, under Divine guidance, as to mark the “Subordination of the Son”—that Subordination which is not a difference of Nature, Power, or Eternity, but of Order; just such as is marked by the simple but profound words Father and Son.—But on the other hand there is <a href="/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>, where the Gr. is (at least) <span class="ital">perfectly capable</span> of the rendering “our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.” And if, as St John is witness, it is divinely true that “the Word is God,” it is surely far from wonderful if here and there, in peculiar connexions, an equally inspired Teacher should so speak of Christ, even though guided to keep another side of the truth habitually in view. Now, beyond all fair question, the Greek here (in view of the usual order of words in ascriptions of praise) is certainly best rendered as in E. V.: had it not been for controversy, probably, no other rendering would have been suggested. And lastly, the context far rather suggests a <span class="ital">lament</span> (over the fall of Israel) than an ascription of praise; while it also pointedly suggests <span class="ital">some allusion</span> to the <span class="ital">super</span>-human Nature of Christ, by the words “<span class="ital">according to the flesh</span>.” But if there is such an allusion, then it must lie in the words “<span class="ital">over all, God</span>.”—We thus advocate the rendering of the E. V., as clearly the best grammatically, and the best suited to the context.—Observe lastly that while St John (<a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>; and <span class="ital">perhaps</span> <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, where E. V. “Son;”) uses the word God of Christ, and in <a href="/john/12-41.htm" title="These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.">John 12:41</a> distinctly implies that He is Jehovah, (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>,) yet his Gospel is quite as full of the Filial Subordination as of the Filial Deity and Co-equality. So that the <span class="ital">words</span> of St Paul here are scarcely more exceptional in him than they would be in St John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for ever</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">unto the ages</span>; the familiar phrase for endless duration, under all possible developements, where God and the other world are in question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Amen</span>] The word is properly a Hebrew adverb (“<span class="ital">surely</span>”), repeatedly used as here in O. T. See e.g. <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm" title="Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-19.htm" title="And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.">Psalm 72:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-5.htm" title="That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.">Jeremiah 11:5</a> (marg. E. V.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.

All, that is of importance to me in it, I have explained <span class="ital">im Zeugniss</span>, p. 157, etc. (ed. 1748), [c. 11, 28].—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξ ὧν</span>, <span class="ital">and of whom, i.e.</span> of the Israelites, <a href="/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>. To the six privileges of the Israelites lately mentioned are added the seventh and eighth, respecting the fathers, and respecting the Messiah Himself. <span class="ital">Israel</span> is a noble and a holy people.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστι</span>, but the participle has a more narrow meaning. Artemonius with great propriety proves from the grief of Paul, that there is no doxology in this passage: Part I. cap. 42; but at the same time he along with his associates contends, that Paul wrote <span class="greekheb">ὧν ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων</span>, <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. So that there may be denoted in the passage this privilege of the Israelites, that the Lord is their God; and he interprets the clause, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων</span>, thus: that this privilege is the greatest of all the honours conferred upon Israel. But such an interpretation of the <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων</span>, with which comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm" title="One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.">Ephesians 4:6</a> (that we may remove this out of our way in the first place), implies a meaning, which owes its birth merely to the support of an hypothesis, and which requires to be expressed rather by a phrase of this sort; <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὴ πάντων μεῖζον</span>. The conjecture itself, <span class="greekheb">ὧν ὁ</span>, carries with it an open violation of the text. For I. it dissevers <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span> from the antithetic member of the sentence, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πνεῦμα</span>,[109] which is usually everywhere mentioned [expressed]. II. It at the same time divides the last member of the enumeration [of the catalogue of privileges], before which <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>, is suitably placed, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξ ὧν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. into two members, and in the second of these the conjunction is by it harshly suppressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[109] <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="ital">according to His divine nature</span>. The words <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων θεός</span> are equivalent to <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πνεῦμα</span>, and form a plain antithesis to <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span> = <span class="ital">His human nature</span>.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Artemonius objects: I. Christ is nowhere in the sacred Scriptures expressly called God. <span class="ital">Ans</span>. Nowhere? Doubtless because Artemonius endeavours to get rid of all those passages either by proposing a different reading, or by a different mode of interpretation. He himself admits, that too many proofs of one thing ought not to be demanded, page 225. In regard to the rest, see note on <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. He objects, II. If Paul wrote <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span>, he omitted the principal privilege of the Israelites, that God, who is the Best and Greatest of all, was their God. <span class="ital">Ans</span>. The <span class="ital">adoption</span> and the <span class="ital">glory</span> had consisted in that very circumstance; therefore he did not omit it; nor is that idea, <span class="ital">the Lord is the God of Israel</span>, ever expressed in these words, <span class="ital">Thine, O Israel, is God blessed for ever</span>. He urges further; Christ is included even in the <span class="ital">covenants</span>, and yet Paul presently after makes mention of <span class="ital">Christ;</span> how much more would he be likely to make mention of God the Father Himself? <span class="ital">Ans</span>. The reason in the case of Christ for His being mentioned does not equally hold good in the case of God. Paul mentions in the order of time all the privileges of Israel (the fathers being by the way [incidentally] joined with Christ). He therefore mentions Christ, as He was manifested [last in order of time]; but it was not necessary that that should be in like manner mentioned of God. Moreover, Christ was in singularly near relationship to the Israelites; but God was also the God of the Gentiles, ch. <a href="/romans/3-29.htm" title="Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:">Romans 3:29</a> : and it was not God, but Christ, whom the Jews rejected more openly. What? In the very root of the name <span class="ital">Israel</span>, and therefore of the <span class="ital">Israelites</span>, to which the apostle refers, <a href="/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:">Romans 9:6</a>, the name <span class="ital">El, God</span>, is found. He objects, III. The style of the Fathers disagrees with this opinion: nay, the false Ignatius [pseudoignatius] reckons among the ministers of Satan those, who said, that Jesus Himself is God over all. Ans. By this phrase, he has somewhat incautiously described the Sabellians, and next to them he immediately places the Artemonites in the same class. In other respects the fathers often apply the phraseology of Paul respecting Christ to the Father, and by that very circumstance prove the true force of that phraseology [as expressing Divinity]; and yet the apostle is superior to [should have more weight than] the fathers.

The apostles, who wrote before John, take for granted the deity of Christ, as a thing acknowledged; whence it is that they do not directly treat of it, but yet when it comes in their way, they mark it in a most glorious manner. Paul, ch. <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>, had called Jesus Christ <span class="ital">man;</span> but he now calls Him God; so also <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>.

This difference indicates the difference in the interpretation; some rendering as concerning the flesh Christ came. God who is over all be blessed for ever; thus making the words God, etc., a doxology: others, with the comma, the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever; i.e., Christ is God (For minor variations see margin of Rev.)<p>Amen<p>See on <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>. </body></html>
