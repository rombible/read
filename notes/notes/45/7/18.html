The believer sees more of the beauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know - This is designed as an illustration of what he had just said, that sin dwelt in him.<p>That is, in my flesh - In my unrenewed nature; in my propensities and inclinations before conversion. Does not this qualifying expression show that in this discussion he was speaking of himself as a renewed man? Hence, he is careful to imply that there was at that time in him something that was right or acceptable with God, but that that did not pertain to him by nature.<p>Dwelleth - His soul was wholly occupied by what was evil. It had taken entire possession.<p>No good thing - There could not be possibly a stronger expression of belief of the doctrine of total depravity. It is Paul's own representation of himself. It proves that his heart was wholly evil. And if this was true of him, it is true of all others. It is a good way to examine ourselves, to inquire whether we have such a view of our own native character as to say that we know that in our flesh there dwelleth no good thing. The sense here is, that so far as the flesh was concerned, that is, in regard to his natural inclinations and desires, there was nothing good; all was evil. This was true in his entire conduct before conversion, where the desires of the flesh reigned and rioted without control; and it was true after conversion, so far as the natural inclinations and propensities of the flesh were concerned. All those operations in every stake were evil, and not the less evil because they are experienced under the light and amidst the influences of the gospel.<p>To will - To purpose or intend to do good.<p>Is present with me - I can do that. It is possible; it is in my power. The expression may also imply that it was near to him &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  parakeitai, that is, it was constantly before him; it was now his habitual inclination and purpose of mind. It is the uniform, regular, habitual purpose of the Christian's mind to do right.<p>But how - The sense would have been better retained here if the translators had not introduced the word "how." The difficulty was not in the mode of performing it, but to do the thing itself.<p>I find not - I do not find it in my power; or I find strong, constant obstacles, so that I fail of doing it. The obstacles are not natural, but such as arise from long indulgence in sin; the strong native propensity to evil. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The apostle goes on to give some further account of himself, what he knew, and was fully assured of by long experience; as that <p>dwelleth no good thing in him, that is, in his flesh, or carnal self; for otherwise there were many good things dwelt in him; there was the good work of grace, and the good word of God in him, and even Father, Son, and Spirit, dwelt in him; but his meaning is, that there was no good thing naturally in him; no good thing of his own putting there; nothing but what God had put there; no good thing, but what was owing to Christ, to the grace of God, and influence of the Spirit; or as he himself explains it, there was no good thing in his "flesh"; in the old man that was in him, which has nothing in his nature good; no good thing comes out of him, nor is any good thing done by him: and this explanative and limiting clause, "that is, in my flesh", clearly proves, that the apostle speaks of himself, and as regenerate; for had he spoke in the person of an unregenerate man, there would have been no room nor reason for such a restriction, seeing an unregenerate man is nothing else but flesh, and has nothing but flesh, or corrupt nature in him; and who does not know, that no good thing dwells in such persons? whereas the apostle intimates by this explication, that he had something else in him beside flesh, and which is opposed to it; and that is spirit, or the new man, which is of a spiritual nature, and is seated in the spirit, or soul, and comes from the Spirit of God; and in this spiritual man dwell good things, for "the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth"; so that though there was no good thing dwelling in his flesh, in the old than, yet there were good things dwelling in his spirit, in the new and spiritual man, the hidden man of the heart: and he adds, <p>to will is present with me; which must be understood, not of the power and faculty of the will, with respect to things natural and civil, which is common to all men; nor of a will to that which is evil, which is in wicked men; but of a will to that which was good, which he had not of himself, but from God, and is only to be found in regenerate persons; and denotes the readiness of his mind and will to that which is spiritually good, like that which Christ observes of his disciples, when he says, "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak", <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>, which may serve much to illustrate the passage before us: since it follows, <p>but how to perform that which is good, I find not; he found he had no strength of himself to do what he willed; and that he could do nothing without Christ; and that what he did by the strength and grace of Christ, he did not do perfectly. To will to live without sin, not to have a lustful or a revengeful thought in his breast, was present with him, but how to perform, how to live in this manner, which was so desirable to him, being born again, he found not. It may be asked, how does this agree with what the apostle says, "it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure?" <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>. To this it may be replied, that when God does work in his people both to will and to do, he does not work both equally alike, or to the same degree, so that the work answers to the will; God never works in them so to do, as to will, for when they are wrought in, acted upon, and influenced to do the most, and that in the best manner, they never do all that they would; and sometimes God works in them to will, when he does not work in them to do; as in the case of the disciples of Christ, in whom he worked to will to watch with Christ an hour, but did not work in them to do, <a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a>; and whenever he works in the saints, whether to will or to do, or both, it is always of his own good pleasure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> <i>how</i> to perform that which is good I find not.</span><p>(12) This vice, or sin, or law of sin, wholly possesses those men who are not regenerated, and hinders them or holds those back who are regenerated.<p>(a) This indeed is appropriate to the man whom the grace of God has made a new man: for where the Spirit is not, how can there be any strife there?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>.

For instance, affections, right and wholesome in themselves, are spoiled by the absence of right affections <span class="ital">towards God</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible to explain the Gr. words somewhat differently, though in a way which alters the sense hardly, if at all: “For I know that it is not a <span class="ital">good</span> thing that dwells in me, [but that <span class="ital">sin</span> does.]” There is a languor however about the form of such an assertion, quite unlike the context, which insists upon a terrible reality of evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in me</span> (<span class="ital">that is, in my flesh</span>)] See below on <a href="/context/romans/8-7.htm" title="Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be....">Romans 8:7-8</a>. “The flesh,” practically, is the man as unregenerate, and then (after grace) the <span class="ital">Alter Ego</span> of the still-abiding impulses and tendencies of evil. Here St Paul is careful not to say that in his whole condition then present there was no good thing dwelling; for the Divine Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>) and His influences “dwelt in him.” And yet he calls “the flesh” still his <span class="ital">Ego;</span> because he is contrasting his condition as a whole with the absolute and holy Law. See note on <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>, (“I am carnal,”) where is explained the apparent inconsistency of the Ego being sometimes distinguished from, sometimes identified with, what is evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is present with me</span>] <span class="bld">Is within my reach</span>. Meyer takes this to refer to the unregenerate man; and such is his view of this passage throughout. But see <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>, and <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>. In this context, the will is represented as <span class="ital">uniformly</span> biassed against sin and for holiness; this, surely, cannot be the unregenerate will.—Logically, no doubt, the will of the <span class="ital">believing</span> soul ought always to conquer evil, because faith calls in Divine power. But then just here comes in the mystery stated in <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>, and which is a permanent <span class="ital">fact</span> of Christian experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I find not</span>] The will is, on the whole, really sanctified; but its exercise is impeded. The counter-influences of “the flesh “<span class="ital">bewilder</span> it in the struggle. Its weapons, so to speak, are not always <span class="ital">drawn</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another reading, but not so well attested, is, “To will is present with me, but to perform that which is good, <span class="ital">is not so</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἶδα</span>, <span class="ital">I know</span>) This very knowledge is a part of this state, which is here described.—<span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν</span>, <span class="ital">that is</span>) It is a limitation of the sense; <span class="ital">in me</span> is more than <span class="ital">in my flesh</span>, and yet the flesh is not called sin itself[75] (we must make this observation contrary to the opinion of Flacius); but what Paul says, is: sin dwells in the flesh. And already this state, of which Paul is treating, carries along with it some element of good.—<span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> <span class="ital">to will</span>) The Accusative, <span class="ital">good</span>, is not added after <span class="ital">to will;</span> and the delicacy [minute accuracy] of this language expresses the delicacy [minute accuracy] in the use of the expression, <span class="ital">to will</span>.—<span class="greekheb">παράκειται</span>) [<span class="ital">is present</span>] <span class="ital">lies in view</span>, without [my being able to gain] the victory. The antithesis, concerning the performance of good works, is the <span class="ital">not</span> [I find <span class="ital">not</span>] which occurs presently after. My mind, though seeking [that, which is good], does not in reality find it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] It is only called <span class="ital">sinful</span>.—ED.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In me<p>The entire man in whom sin and righteousness struggle, in whose unregenerate condition sin is the victor, having its domain in the flesh.

That another element is present appears from "to will is present with me;" but it is the flesh which determines his activity as an unregenerate man. There is good in the I, but not in the I considered as carnal. This is brought out in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, "With the flesh (I serve) the law of sin."
