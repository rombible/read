Before that mortification of the flesh which proceeds from our relation to the death of Christ, we bore a fruit generated through our carnal appetites by the Law, and the only being to whose honour and glory they contributed was Death.<p>The sins committed under the old dispensation are regarded as due to a two-fold agency—on the one hand to the Law (the operation of which is described more particularly in <a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7-8</a>), and on the other hand to the flesh, which was only too susceptible to any influence that would call out its sinful impulses. Those impulses have now been mortified, as if by a course of asceticism, through union with the death of Christ.<p>The “body” is regarded by St. Paul as a neutral principle, which is not in itself either good or bad. It is simply the material frame of men, which though itself “of the earth earthy” is capable of becoming a dwelling-place for the Spirit, and being put to holy uses. The “flesh” is the same material frame regarded as the seat of sinful appetites, and with a tendency to obey the lower rather than the higher self. The proper way to overcome this lower self is by that spiritual asceticism which the believer goes through by his appropriation of the death of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Motions of sins.</span>—The same word which is translated in <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>, “affections”—those emotions or passions which lead to sin.<p><span class= "bld">Which were by the law</span>.—Which the Law served to stimulate and quicken in the manner described below.<p><span class= "bld">Did work.</span>—Were active or astir, opposed to that state of torpor or mortification to which they were reduced in the Christian.<p><span class= "bld">Unto death.</span>—Death is here personified as the king of that region which sin serves to enrich.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death....">Romans 7:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">For </span>— We ought now to be fruitful in good works, because we were formerly fruitful in evil: <span class="ital">when we were in the flesh </span>— Under the comparatively carnal dispensation of Moses, and in our natural corrupt state, before we believed on Christ and were regenerated.

It is evident, therefore, as Dr. Whitby justly observes, that this expression, <span class="ital">when we were in the flesh, </span>not only signifies to be under the carnal ordinances of the law, for so were all the pious Jews, who lived from Moses to gospel times; but that it more especially relates to them who, living under these ordinances, were themselves carnal, and so had <span class="ital">the law of the flesh still warring against the law of their minds, </span>and bringing them <span class="ital">into captivity to the law of sin, </span>which could not be the state of Zacharias and Elisabeth, or any other of those persons who were <span class="ital">righteous before God, </span>and <span class="ital">walked in all the commandments of the Lord blameless. </span>And if of such [unregenerate persons] only, we understand the apostle’s following discourse in this chapter, the sense will be clear. <span class="ital">The motions of sins </span>— <span class="greekheb">Τα παθηματα των αμαρτιων</span>, <span class="ital">sinful passions; which were by the law </span>— Accidentally occasioned or irritated thereby; <span class="ital">did work in our members </span>— Spread themselves all over the whole man; <span class="ital">to bring forth fruit </span>— Very different from that which has just been mentioned, even such as would have been <span class="ital">unto death, </span><a href="/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a>; that is, would have exposed us to, and have issued in, eternal death, if God in his mercy had not interposed, and brought us acquainted with the gospel. <span class="ital">But now </span>— Being brought out of that carnal state; <span class="ital">we are delivered from the law — </span>Set at liberty from our subjection to it as a law, and our obligation to observe it, and from the condemning, irritating power thereof, and therefore from the sinful passions occasioned by it; <span class="ital">that being dead wherein we were held </span>— In subjection, as the wife to her living husband; that law being now made void, and having no further power to condemn us. It may be proper to observe here, that the Syriac and Arabic versions, Origen, Theodoret, Œcumenius, and Theophylact, (with whom agree Bengelius, Mill, Macknight, and others,) read <span class="greekheb">αποθανοντες</span>, <span class="ital">we being dead to that by </span>which we were held: which, says Origen, is undoubtedly the best reading, agreeing with <a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>, <span class="ital">ye are become dead to the law.

The new service here enjoined implies, 1st, A freedom from the dominion of the flesh, by the power of the Spirit enabling us to mortify the deeds and lusts of the flesh, <a href="/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>. 2d, The serving God, not chiefly with bodily services and carnal ordinances, but <span class="ital">in the spirit of our minds, </span><a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a>; having our minds renewed and transformed after the image of God, in righteousness and true holiness, which are the fruits of the Spirit. 3d, The serving him by the continual aid of his Spirit, strengthening us <span class="ital">with might in the inner man, </span><a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>, so as to <span class="ital">live </span>and <span class="ital">walk in the Spirit, </span>or to live as those who are renewed by the Spirit, and possessed of his various graces. With regard to the believing Jews in particular, it implies, that being loosed from the Mosaic law, they were no longer to worship and serve God with rites and ceremonies pertaining to their <span class="ital">flesh, </span>but with services of their <span class="ital">spirit, </span>consisting in faith, love, and new obedience. From this, however, we must not infer that the pious Jews under the law did not serve God with spiritual services: all the services in which true piety and morality consist, were enjoined in the covenant with Abraham, and were practised by the pious Israelites. But to these the law of Moses added numberless services pertaining to the body, from which the converted Jews were freed since their embracing the gospel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them. And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when ... - The illustration in this verse and the following is designed to show more at length the effect of the Law, whenever and whereever applied; whether in a state of nature or of grace. It was always the same. It was the occasion of agitation and conflict in a man's own mind. This was true when a sinner was under conviction; and it was true when a man was a Christian. In all circumstances where the Law was applied to the corrupt mind of man, it produced this agitation and conflict. Even in the Christian's mind it produced this agitation <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14-24</a>, as it had done and would do in the mind of a sinner under conviction <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-12</a>, and consequently there was no hope of release but in the delivering and sanctifying power of the gospel <a href="/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-3</a>.<p>In the flesh - Unconverted; subject to the controlling passions and propensities of a corrupt nature; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8-9</a>.

This respects not their being under the legal dispensation, the Mosaic economy; which lay greatly in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, such as regarded the flesh chiefly; so their meats and drinks concerned the body; their ablutions and washings sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; their circumcision was outward in the flesh; the several rituals of the law consisted in outward things, though typical of internal and spiritual ones; hence those that trusted in them trusted in the flesh: but to be "in the flesh" stands opposed, <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>; to a being "in the spirit"; whereas there were many under that legal and carnal dispensation who were in the spirit, and had the Spirit of God, as David and others; besides, the apostle must be thought to use the phrase in such a sense, as to include all the persons he is speaking of and writing to, who were both Jews and Gentiles, for of such the church at Rome consisted; and the sense is this, "for when we", Jews and Gentiles, who are now believers in Christ, "were" formerly, before our conversion to, and faith in Christ, "in the flesh", that is, in a corrupt, carnal, and unregenerate state and condition; in which sense the word "flesh" is frequently used in the next chapter: now not all such who have flesh, sin, or corrupt nature in them, must be reckoned to be in the flesh, for there is a difference between flesh being in persons, from which none are free in this life, and their being in the flesh; nor all such who commit sin, or do carnal things at times, for there is not a just man that doth good and sinneth not; but such who are as they were born, without any alteration made in them by the Spirit and grace of God; who have nothing but flesh in them, no fear of God, nor love to and faith in Christ, nor any experience of the work of the Spirit of God upon their souls; no true sight and sense of sin, nor any spiritual knowledge of salvation by Christ; in whom flesh is the governing principle, whose minds and principles are carnal, and their conversation wholly so; yea, persons may be in the flesh, in an unregenerate state, who may abstain from the grosser immoralities of life, and even make a profession of religion: now such these had been the apostle is speaking of and to, and tells how it was with them when in this state; <p>the motions of sins which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death: by "the motions of sin" are meant, the evil passions and affections of the mind, the lusts of the heart, sinful desires, evil thoughts, the imaginations of the thoughts of the heart, the first motions of the mind to sin: these "were by the law"; not as the efficient cause of them, that neither produces nor encourages them; it is holy, just, and good, requires truth in the inward parts, and not only forbids the outward acts of sin, but even covetous desires, and lustful thoughts: no, these inward motions of sin arise from a corrupt heart and nature; are encouraged and cherished by the old man that dwells there; and men are enticed by Satan to a compliance with them. Some think that the meaning of the phrase is, that these secret lusts of the heart are made known by the law, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>, so they are, but not whilst a man is in the flesh, or in an unregenerate state, but when he comes to be wrought upon powerfully by the Spirit of God, who makes use of the law to such a purpose: but the true sense of it is, that these motions of sin are irritated, provoked, and increased, through the law's prohibition of them; which is not to be charged as a fault on the law, but to be imputed to the depravity and corruption of man; who is like to one in a burning fever, very desirous of drink, who the more it is forbid, the more eager is he of it; or like a mighty torrent of water, which rises, rages, flows, and overflows, the more any methods are taken to stop its current; or like a filthy dunghill, which when the sun strikes powerfully on it, it exhales and draws out its filthy stench; which nauseous smell is not to be imputed to the pure rays of the sun, but to the filthiness of the dunghill: these motions of sin are said to "work in our members"; in the members of our bodies, which these sinful affections of the soul make use of to put them into action, and so they bring forth fruit; very evil fruit indeed, for nothing else can be expected from such an evil tree as the corrupt nature of man is: and this fruit is "unto death": deadly fruit, worthy of death, and would issue in eternal death, if grace did not prevent: the rise, beginning, motion, progress, and issue of sin, are most exactly and beautifully described, agreeably to this account here, by the Apostle James, <a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For when we <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> were in the flesh, the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> motions of sins, which were by the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> law, did <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</span><p>(3) A declaration of the former saying: for he says that the fleshly desires which the law stirred up in us were in us as if they were a husband, from whom we brought forth very deadly and cursed children: but now that husband is dead, and so consequently, being delivered from the force of that killing law, we have passed into the control of the Spirit, so that we bring forth now, not those rotten and dead children, but rather living children.<p>(e) When we were in the state of the first marriage, which he calls in the following verse the oldness of the letter.<p>(f) The motions that urged us to sin, which show their force even in our minds.<p>(g) He does not say of the law but by the law, because they spring from sin which dwells within us, and take occasion to work in us in this way, by reason of the restraint that the law makes, not that the fault is in the law, but in ourselves. <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Worked by their strength.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>.

Compare <a href="/philippians/1-22.htm">Philippians 1:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-8</a>.<p>&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body, and not &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh, is used when the reference is to a metaphorical organism, as the church, <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4</a> sqq.; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, etc.<p>The &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; is described as mortal (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>); subject to infirmity (<a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>); locally limited (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>); an object of fostering care (<a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29</a>).<p>4. Living beings generally, including their mental nature, and with a correlated notion of weakness and perishableness. Thus the phrase &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; all flesh (<a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). This accessory notion of weakness stands in contrast with God. In Paul the phrase all flesh is cited from the Old Testament (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>) and is used independently (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>). In all these instances before God is added. So in <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>, flesh and blood implies a contrast of human with divine wisdom. Compare <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>. This leads up to<p>5. Man "either as a creature in his natural state apart from Christ, or the creaturely side or aspect of the man in Christ." Hence it is correlated with &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; man, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. Compare <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>. Thus the flesh would seem to be interchangeable with the old man.<p>It has affections and lusts (<a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>); willings (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6</a>, <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>); a mind (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>); a body (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<p>It is in sharp contrast with &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit (<a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-24</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>). The flesh and the spirit are thus antagonistic. &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh, before or in contrast with his reception of the divine element whereby he becomes a new creature in Christ: the whole being of man as it exists and acts apart from the influence of the Spirit. It properly characterizes, therefore, not merely the lower forms of sensual gratification, but all - the highest developments of the life estranged from God, whether physical, intellectual, or aesthetic.<p>It must be carefully noted:<p>1. That Paul does not identify flesh and sin. Compare, flesh of sin, <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>. See <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-17.htm">Romans 7:17</a>, <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>.<p>2. That Paul does not identify &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; with the material body nor associate sin exclusively and predominantly with the body. The flesh is the flesh of the living man animated by the soul (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;) as its principle of life, and is distinctly used as coordinate with &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; man. As in the Old Testament, "it embraces in an emphatic manner the nature of man, mental and corporeal, with its internal distinctions." The spirit as well as the flesh is capable of defilement (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>; compare <a href="/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>). Christian life is to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; compare <a href="/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23</a>).<p>continued...</body></html>
