The believer sees more of the beauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the good ... - This is substantially a repetition of what is said in <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15</a>. The repetition shows how full the mind of the apostle was of the subject; and how much inclined he was to dwell upon it, and to place it in every variety of form. It is not uncommon for Paul thus to express his intense interest in a subject, by placing it in a great variety of aspects, even at the hazard of much repetition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19, 21. For, &c.&#8212;The conflict here graphically described between a self that "desires" to do good and a self that in spite of this does evil, cannot be the struggles between conscience and passion in the unregenerate, because the description given of this "desire to do good" in Ro 7:22 is such as cannot be ascribed, with the least show of truth, to any but the renewed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 19,20.
