But the common reading, being supported by almost all the ancient manuscripts, and the Syriac version, is to be preferred; especially as it contains an ellipsis, which, if supplied, according to the apostle’s manner, from the foregoing sentence, will give even a better sense than the Clermont reading, thus: <span class="ital">Who will deliver me?

Nay, you may put it to a use quite contrary to that for which it was intended. This those do who so take Romans 7. out of its connection with <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>., as to make it mean the very reverse of what the apostle designed. In <a href="/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a>., and in the beginning of the seventh chapter, he describes the glorious liberty of the children of God under the Christian dispensation. And as a skilful painter puts shades in his pictures, to heighten the effect of the lights; so the judicious apostle introduces, in the latter part of chap. 7., a lively description of the domineering power of sin, and of the intolerable burden of guilt; a burden this which he had so severely felt, when the convincing Spirit charged sin home upon his conscience, after he had broken his good resolutions; but especially during the three days of his blindness and fasting at Damascus. Then he groaned, <span class="ital">O wretched man that I am, </span>&c., hanging night and day between despair and hope, between unbelief and faith, between bondage and freedom, till God brought him into Christian liberty by the ministry of Ananias; — of this liberty the apostle gives us a further and fuller account in chapter eight. Therefore the description of the man who [unacquainted with the gospel] groans under the galling yoke of sin, is brought in merely by contrast, to set off the amazing difference there is between the bondage of sin, and the liberty of gospel holiness: just as the generals who entered Rome in triumph, used to make a show of the prince whom they had conquered. On such occasions, the conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot crowned with laurel; while the captive king followed him on foot, loaded with chains, and making, next to the conqueror, the most striking part of the show. Now, if, in a Roman triumph, some of the spectators had taken <span class="ital">the chained king on foot, </span>for the <span class="ital">victorious general in the chariot, </span>because the one immediately followed the other, they would have been guilty of a mistake not unlike that of those who take the carnal Jew, <span class="ital">sold under sin, </span>and groaning as he goes along, for the Christian believer, who <span class="ital">walks in the Spirit, </span>exults in the liberty of God’s children, and <span class="ital">always triumphs in Christ. </span>See Fletcher’s Works, vol. 4., Amer. edit, pp. 336, 337. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:23-25 This passage does not represent the apostle as one that walked after the flesh, but as one that had it greatly at heart, not to walk so. And if there are those who abuse this passage, as they also do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction, yet serious Christians find cause to bless God for having thus provided for their support and comfort. We are not, because of the abuse of such as are blinded by their own lusts, to find fault with the scripture, or any just and well warranted interpretation of it. And no man who is not engaged in this conflict, can clearly understand the meaning of these words, or rightly judge concerning this painful conflict, which led the apostle to bemoan himself as a wretched man, constrained to what he abhorred. He could not deliver himself; and this made him the more fervently thank God for the way of salvation revealed through Jesus Christ, which promised him, in the end, deliverance from this enemy. So then, says he, I myself, with my mind, my prevailing judgement, affections, and purposes, as a regenerate man, by Divine grace, serve and obey the law of God; but with the flesh, the carnal nature, the remains of depravity, I serve the law of sin, which wars against the law of my mind. Not serving it so as to live in it, or to allow it, but as unable to free himself from it, even in his very best state, and needing to look for help and deliverance out of himself. It is evident that he thanks God for Christ, as our deliverer, as our atonement and righteousness in himself, and not because of any holiness wrought in us. He knew of no such salvation, and disowned any such title to it. He was willing to act in all points agreeable to the law, in his mind and conscience, but was hindered by indwelling sin, and never attained the perfection the law requires. What can be deliverance for a man always sinful, but the free grace of God, as offered in Christ Jesus? The power of Divine grace, and of the Holy Spirit, could root out sin from our hearts even in this life, if Divine wisdom had not otherwise thought fit. But it is suffered, that Christians might constantly feel, and understand thoroughly, the wretched state from which Divine grace saves them; might be kept from trusting in themselves; and might ever hold all their consolation and hope, from the rich and free grace of God in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank God - That is, I thank God for effecting a deliverance to which I am myself incompetent. There is a way of rescue, and I trace it altogether to his mercy in the Lord Jesus Christ. What conscience could not do, what the Law could not do, what unaided human strength could not do, has been accomplished by the plan of the gospel; and complete deliverance can be expected there, and there alone. This is the point to which all his reasoning had tended; and having thus shown that the Law was insufficient to effect this deliverance. he is now prepared to utter the language of Christian thankfulness that it can be effected by the gospel. The superiority of the gospel to the Law in overcoming all the evils under which man labors, is thus triumphantly established; compare <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>.<p>So then - As the result of the whole inquiry we have come to this conclusion.<p>With the mind - With the understanding, the conscience, the purposes, or intentions of the soul. This is a characteristic of the renewed nature.

The flesh throughout, in all its native propensities and passions, leads to sin; it has no tendency to holiness; and its corruptions can be overcome only by the grace of God. We have thus,<p>(1) A view of the sad and painful conflict between sin and God. They are opposed in all things.<p>(2) we see the raging, withering effect of sin on the soul. In all circumstances it tends to death and woe.<p>(3) we see the feebleness of the Law and of conscience to overcome this. The tendency of both is to produce conflict and woe. And,<p>(4) We see that the gospel only can overcome sin. To us it should be a subject of everincreasing thankfulness, that what could not be accomplished by the Law, can be thus effected by the gospel; and that God has devised a plan that thus effects complete deliverance, and which gives to the captive in sin an everlasting triumph. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

God's holy law is dear to my renewed mind, and has the willing service of my new man; although that corrupt nature which still remains in me listens to the dictates of sin."<p>Note, (1) This whole chapter was of essential service to the Reformers in their contendings with the Church of Rome. When the divines of that corrupt church, in a Pelagian spirit, denied that the sinful principle in our fallen nature, which they called "Concupiscence," and which is commonly called "Original Sin," had the nature of sin at all, they were triumphantly answered from this chapter, where&#8212;both in the first section of it, which speaks of it in the unregenerate, and in the second, which treats of its presence and actings in believers&#8212;it is explicitly, emphatically, and repeatedly called "sin." As such, they held it to be damnable. (See the Confessions both of the Lutheran and Reformed churches). In the following century, the orthodox in Holland had the same controversy to wage with "the Remonstrants" (the followers of Arminius), and they waged it on the field of this chapter. (2) Here we see that Inability is consistent with Accountability. (See Ro 7:18; Ga 5:17). "As the Scriptures constantly recognize the truth of these two things, so are they constantly united in Christian experience. Everyone feels that he cannot do the things that he would, yet is sensible that he is guilty for not doing them. Let any man test his power by the requisition to love God perfectly at all times. Alas! how entire our inability! Yet how deep our self-loathing and self-condemnation!" [Hodge]. (3) If the first sight of the Cross by the eye of faith kindles feelings never to be forgotten, and in one sense never to be repeated&#8212;like the first view of an enchanting landscape&#8212;the experimental discovery, in the latter stages of the Christian life, of its power to beat down and mortify inveterate corruption, to cleanse and heal from long-continued backslidings and frightful inconsistencies, and so to triumph over all that threatens to destroy those for whom Christ died, as to bring them safe over the tempestuous seas of this life into the haven of eternal rest&#8212;is attended with yet more heart&#8212;affecting wonder draws forth deeper thankfulness, and issues in more exalted adoration of Him whose work Salvation is from first to last (Ro 7:24, 25). (4) It is sad when such topics as these are handled as mere questions of biblical interpretation or systematic theology. Our great apostle could not treat of them apart from personal experience, of which the facts of his own life and the feelings of his own soul furnished him with illustrations as lively as they were apposite. When one is unable to go far into the investigation of indwelling sin, without breaking out into an, "O wretched man that I am!" and cannot enter on the way of relief without exclaiming "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord," he will find his meditations rich in fruit to his own soul, and may expect, through Him who presides in all such matters, to kindle in his readers or hearers the like blessed emotions (Ro 7:24, 25).

There is a different reading of this passage; some copies read, and so the Vulgate Latin version, thus, "the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord"; which may be considered as an answer to the apostle's earnest request for deliverance, "who shall deliver me?" the grace of God shall deliver me. The grace of God the Father, which is communicated through Christ the Mediator by the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ, the principle of grace formed in the soul by the Spirit of God, which reigns in the believer as a governing principle, through righteousness unto eternal life, will in the issue deliver from indwelling sin, and all the effects of it: but the more general reading is, "thanks be to God", or "I thank God"; the object of thanksgiving is God, as the Father of Christ, and the God of all grace: the medium of it is Christ as Mediator, through whom only we have access to God; without him we can neither pray to him, nor praise him aright; our sacrifices of praise are only acceptable to God, through Christ; and as all our mercies come to us through him, it is but right and fitting that our thanksgivings should pass the same way: the thing for which thanks is given is not expressed, but is implied, and is deliverance; either past, as from the power of Satan, the dominion of sin, the curse of the law, the evil of the world, and from the hands of all spiritual enemies, so as to endanger everlasting happiness; or rather, future deliverance, from the very being of sin: which shows, that at present, and whilst in this life, saints are not free from it; that it is God only that must, and will deliver from it; and that through Christ his Son, through whom we have victory over every enemy, sin, Satan, law, and death; and this shows the apostle's sure and certain faith and hope of this matter, who concludes his discourse on this head thus: <p>so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin; observe, he says, "I myself", and not another; whence it is clear, he does not represent another man in this discourse of his; for this is a phrase used by him, when he cannot possibly be understood of any other but himself; see <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; he divides himself as it were into two parts, the mind, by which he means his inward man, his renewed self; and "the flesh", by which he designs his carnal I, that was sold under sin: and hereby he accounts for his serving, at different times, two different laws; "the law of God", written on his mind, and in the service of which he delighted as a regenerate man; "and the law of sin", to which he was sometimes carried captive: and it should be taken notice of, that he does not say "I have served", as referring to his past state of unregeneracy, but "I serve", as respecting his present state as a believer in Christ, made up of flesh and spirit; which as they are two different principles, regard two different laws: add to all this, that this last account the apostle gives of himself, and which agrees with all he had said before, and confirms the whole, was delivered by him, after he had with so much faith and fervency given thanks to God in a view of his future complete deliverance from sin; which is a clinching argument and proof that he speaks of himself, in this whole discourse concerning indwelling sin, as a regenerate person. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

It has often been assumed that this recapitulation does not connect itself with the previous thanksgiving, but that the latter is rather to be regarded as a parenthetical interruption (see especially Rückert and Fritzsche); indeed, it has even been conjectured that <span class="greekheb">ἄρα οὖν</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span> originally stood immediately after <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a> (Venema, Wassenbergh, Keil, Lachmann, <span class="ital">Praef</span>. p. X, and van Hengel). But the right sense of <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἐγώ</span> is thus misconceived. It has here no other meaning than <span class="ital">I myself</span>, in the sense, namely, <span class="ital">I for my own person</span>, without that higher saving intervention, which I owe to Christ. The contrast with others, which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΌς</span></span></span> with the personal pronoun indicates (comp. <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>, <a href="/romans/15-14.htm" title="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14</a>; Herm. <span class="ital">ad Vig</span>. p. 735; Ast, <span class="ital">Lex. Plat</span>. I. p. 317), results always from the context, and is here evident from the emphatic <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, and, indeed, so that the accent falls on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΌς</span></span></span>. Overlooking this antithetic relation of the “<span class="ital">I myself</span>,” Pareus, Homberg, Estius, and Wolf conceived that Paul wished to obviate the misconception as if he were not speaking in the entire section, and from <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a> onwards in particular, as a regenerate man; Köllner thinks that his object now is to establish still more strongly, by <span class="ital">his own</span> feeling, the truth of what he has previously advanced in the name of humanity. Others explain: “<span class="ital">just I</span>,” who have been previously the subject of discourse (Grotius, Reiche, Tholuck, Krehl, Philippi, Maier, and van Hengel; comp. Fritzsche: “ipse ego, qui meam vicem deploravi,” and Ewald); which is indeed linguistically unobjectionable (Bernhardy, p. 290), but would furnish no adequate ground for the special emphasis which it would have. Others, again, taking <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὁ αὐτός</span> (see Schaefer, <span class="ital">Melet</span>. p. 65; Herm. <span class="ital">ad Soph. Antig</span>. 920, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. I. p. 332 f.; Dissen <span class="ital">ad Pind</span>. p. 412): <span class="ital">ego idem:</span> “cui convenit sequens distributio, qua videri posset unus homo in duos veluti secari,” Beza. So also Erasmus, Castalio, and many others; Klee and Rückert. But in this view also the connection of <span class="greekheb">ἄρα οὖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. with the foregoing thanksgiving is arbitrarily abandoned; and the above use of <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>, as synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ὁ αὐτός</span>, is proper to Ionic poetry, and is not sanctioned by the N. T. OIshausen, indeed, takes <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> as <span class="ital">I, the one and the same</span> (have in me a twofold element), but rejects the usual view, that <span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span> is a recapitulation of <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a> ff., and makes the new section begin with <a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>; so that, after the experience of redemption has been indicated by <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the completely <span class="ital">altered</span> inner state of the man is now described; in which new state the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> appears as emancipated and serving the law of God, and only the lower sphere of the life as still remaining under the law of sin. But against this view we may urge, firstly, that Paul would have expressed himself inaccurately in point of logic, since in that case he must have written: <span class="greekheb">ἄρα οὖν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τῇ μὲν σαρκὶ δουλεύω νόμῷ ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ νοῒ νόμῷ Θεοῦ</span>; secondly, that according to <a href="/context/romans/7-2.htm" title="For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband....">Romans 7:2-3</a>; <a href="/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9</a> ff. the redeemed person is entirely liberated from the law of sin; and lastly, that if the redeemed person remained subject to the law of sin with the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, Paul could not have said <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲν κατάκριμα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in <a href="/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?">Romans 7:1</a>; for see <a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet....">Romans 7:7-9</a>. Umbreit takes it as: <span class="ital">even I;</span> a <span class="ital">climactic</span> sense, which is neither suggested by the context, nor in keeping with the deep humility of the whole confession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δουλεύω νόμῳ Θεοῦ</span>] in so far as the desire and striving of my moral reason (see on <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>) are directed solely to the good, consequently submitted to the regulative standard of the divine law. At the same time, however, in accordance with the double character of my nature, I am subject with my <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> (see on <a href="/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>) to the power of sin, which preponderates (<a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>), so that the direction of will in the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> does not attain to the <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεσθαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Remark</span> 1. The mode in which we interpret <a href="/context/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin....">Romans 7:14-25</a> is of decisive importance for the relation between the Church-doctrine of original sin, as more exactly expressed in the <span class="ital">Formula Concordiae</span>, and the view of the apostle; inasmuch as if in <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a> ff. it is the <span class="ital">unredeemed</span> man under the <span class="ital">law</span> and its discipline, and not the <span class="ital">regenerate</span> man who is under <span class="ital">grace</span>, that is spoken of, then Paul affirms regarding the moral nature of the former and concedes to it what the Church-doctrine decidedly denies to it—comparing it (<span class="ital">Form. Conc</span>. p. 661 f.) with a stone, a block, a pillar of salt—in a way that cannot be justified (in opposition to Frank, <span class="ital">Theol. d. Concordienformel</span>, I. p. 138 f.). Paul clearly ascribes to the higher powers of man (his reason and moral will) the assent to the law of God; while just as clearly, moreover, he teaches the great disproportion in which these natural moral powers stand to the predominance of the sinful power in the flesh, so that the <span class="ital">liberum arbitrium in spiritualibus</span> is wanting to the natural man, and only emerges in the case of the converted person (<a href="/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2</a>). And this want of moral freedom proceeds from the power of sin, which is, according to <a href="/romans/7-8.htm" title="But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.">Romans 7:8</a> ff., posited even with birth, and which asserts itself in opposition to the divine law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Remark</span> 2. How many a Jew in the present day, earnestly concerned about his salvation, may, in relation to his law, feel and sigh just as Paul has here done; only with this difference, that unlike Paul he cannot add the <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ τῷ Θεῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>. The exclamation of thanksgiving shows that the longed-for deliverance has actually been achieved. The regenerate man’s ideal contemplation of his pre-Christian state rises with sudden joy into a declaration of his actual emancipation as a Christian. <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν</span> Christ is regarded as the mediator through whom the thanksgiving ascends to God, not as the author of the deliverance for which thanks are given. With <span class="greekheb">ἄρα οὖν αὐτὸς ἐγώ</span> the Apostle introduces the conclusion of this whole discussion. “So then I myself—that is, I, leaving Jesus Christ our Lord out of the question—can get no further than this: with the mind, or in the inner man, I serve a law of God (a Divine law), but with the flesh, or in my actual outward life, a law of sin.” We might say <span class="ital">the</span> law of God, or of sin; but the absence of the definite article emphasises the character of law. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἐγὼ</span>: see <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">I thank God</span>] Here first <span class="ital">light</span> is let in; the light of hope. The “redemption of the body” shall come. “He who raised up Christ” shall make the “mortal body” immortally sinless, and so complete the rescue and the bliss of the whole man. See <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through Jesus Christ our Lord</span>] “In whom shall all be made alive” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>). He is the meritorious Cause, and the sacred Pledge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">So then</span>, &c.] The Gr. order is <span class="bld">So then I myself with the mind indeed do bondservice to the law of God, but with the flesh to the law of sin</span>. On “<span class="ital">the mind</span>” here, see note just above, last but one on <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>. On “<span class="ital">the law of sin</span>” see second note <span class="ital">ibidem</span>.—“To do bondservice to the law of God,” and that with “the mind,” can only describe the state of things when “the mind” is “<span class="ital">renewed</span>” (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>).—What is the reference of “<span class="ital">I myself”?</span> (for so we must render, and not, as with some translators, “<span class="ital">The same I</span>”). In strict grammar it belongs to <span class="ital">both</span> clauses; to the service with the mind and to that with the flesh. But remembering how St. Paul has recently dwelt on the Ego as “willing” to obey the will of God, it seems best to throw the emphasis, (as we certainly may do in practice,) on the <span class="ital">first</span> clause. Q. d., “In a certain sense, I am in bondage both to God and to sin; but my <span class="ital">true</span> self, my now regenerate ‘mind,’ is <span class="ital">God’s</span> bondservant; it is my ‘<span class="ital">old</span> man,’ my flesh, that serves sin.” The statement is thus nearly the same as that in <a href="/romans/7-17.htm" title="Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:17</a>; <a href="/romans/7-20.htm" title="Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle thus sums up and closes this profound description of the state of self, even when regenerate, <span class="ital">in view of the full demand of the sacred Law</span>. He speaks, let us note again, as one whose very light and progress in Divine life has given him an intense perception of sin as sin, and who therefore sees in the faintest deviation an extent of pain, failure, and bondage, which the soul before grace could not see in sin at all. He looks (<a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>, <span class="ital">init</span>.) for complete future deliverance from this pain; but it is a real pain now. And he has described it mainly with the view of emphasizing both the holiness of the Law, and the fact that its function is, not to subdue sin, but to detect and condemn it. In the golden passages now to follow, he soon comes to the Agency which is to subdue it indeed. See further, <span class="ital">Postscript</span>, p. 268.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐχαριστῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I give thanks</span>) This is unexpectedly, though most pleasantly, mentioned, and is now at length rightly acknowledged, as the one and only refuge. The sentence is categorical: God <span class="ital">will deliver</span> me by Christ; the thing is not in my own power: and that sentence indicates the whole matter: but the moral made [<span class="ital">modus moralis</span>. end.] (of which, see on ch. <a href="/romans/6-17.htm" title="But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.">Romans 6:17</a>), <span class="ital">I give thanks</span>, is added. (As in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 15:57</a> : the sentiment is: God giveth us the victory; but there is added the <span class="greekheb">ηθος</span>, or moral mode, <span class="ital">Thanks be to God</span>.) And the phrase, I <span class="ital">give thanks</span>, as a joyful hymn, stands in opposition to the miserable complaint, which is found in the preceding verse, <span class="ital">wretched that I am</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>) He concludes those topics, on which he had entered at <a href="/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἐγὼ</span>) <span class="ital">I myself</span>.—<span class="greekheb">νόμῳ Θεοῦ</span>—<span class="greekheb">νόμῳ ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="ital">the law of God—the law of sin</span>) <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ</span> is the Dative, not the Ablative, <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>. Man [<span class="ital">the</span> man, whom Paul personifies] is now equally balanced between slavery and liberty, and yet at the same time, panting after liberty, he acknowledges that the law is holy and free from all blame. The balance is rarely even. Here the inclination to good has by this time attained the greater weight of the two.</body></html>
