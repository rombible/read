In his own case the apostle would not have known the sinfulness of his thoughts, motives, and actions, but by the law. That perfect standard showed how wrong his heart and life were, proving his sins to be more numerous than he had before thought, but it did not contain any provision of mercy or grace for his relief. He is ignorant of human nature and the perverseness of his own heart, who does not perceive in himself a readiness to fancy there is something desirable in what is out of reach. We may perceive this in our children, though self-love makes us blind to it in ourselves. The more humble and spiritual any Christian is, the more clearly will he perceive that the apostle describes the true believer, from his first convictions of sin to his greatest progress in grace, during this present imperfect state. St. Paul was once a Pharisee, ignorant of the spirituality of the law, having some correctness of character, without knowing his inward depravity. When the commandment came to his conscience by the convictions of the Holy Spirit, and he saw what it demanded, he found his sinful mind rise against it. He felt at the same time the evil of sin, his own sinful state, that he was unable to fulfil the law, and was like a criminal when condemned. But though the evil principle in the human heart produces sinful motions, and the more by taking occasion of the commandment; yet the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good. It is not favourable to sin, which it pursues into the heart, and discovers and reproves in the inward motions thereof. Nothing is so good but a corrupt and vicious nature will pervert it. The same heat that softens wax, hardens clay. Food or medicine when taken wrong, may cause death, though its nature is to nourish or to heal. The law may cause death through man's depravity, but sin is the poison that brings death. Not the law, but sin discovered by the law, was made death to the apostle. The ruinous nature of sin, and the sinfulness of the human heart, are here clearly shown.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was then that which is good ... - This is another objection which the apostle proceeds to answer. The objection is this, "Can it be possible that what is admitted to be good and pure, should be changed into evil? Can what tends to life, be made death to a man?" In answer to this, the apostle repeats that the fault was not in the Law, but was in himself, and in his sinful propensities.<p>Made death - <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>, <a href="/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>.<p>God forbid - Note, <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>.<p>But sin - This is a personification of sin as in <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>.<p>That it might appear sin - That it might develope its true nature, and no longer be dormant in the mind. The Law of God is often applied to a man's conscience, that he may see how deep and desperate is his depravity. No man knows his own heart until the Law thus crosses his path, and shows him what he is.<p>By the commandment - Note, <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>.<p>Might become exceeding sinful - In the original this is a very strong expression, and is one of those used by Paul to express strong emphasis, or intensity &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  kath huperbole&#772;n by hyperboles. In an excessive degree; to the utmost possible extent, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>. The phrase occurs in each of these places. The sense here is, that by the giving of the command, and its application to the mind, sin was completely developed; it was excited, inflamed, aggravated, and showed to be excessively malignant and deadly. It was not a dormant, slumbering principle; but it was awfully opposed to God and His Law. Calvin has well expressed the sense: "It was proper that the enormity of sin should be revealed by the Law; because unless sin should break forth by some dreadful and enormous excess (as they say,) it would not be known to be sin. This excess exhibits itself the more violently, while it turns life into death." The sentiment of the whole is, that the tendency of the Law is to excite the dormant sin of the bosom into active existence, and to reveal its true nature. It is desirable that that should be done, and as that is all that the Law accomplishes, it is not adapted to sanctify the soul. To show that this was the design of the apostle, it is desirable that sin should be thus seen in its true nature, because,<p>(1) Man should be acquainted with his true character. He should not deceive himself.<p>(2) because it is one part of God's plan to develope the secret feelings of the heart, and to show to all creatures what they are.<p>(3) because only by knowing this, will the sinner be induced to take a remedy, and strive to be saved. So God often allows people to plunge into sin; to act out their nature, so that they may see themselves, and be alarmed at the consequences of their own crimes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

So much for the law in relation to the unregenerate, of whom the apostle takes himself as the example; first, in his ignorant, self-satisfied condition; next, under humbling discoveries of his inability to keep the law, through inward contrariety to it; finally, as self-condemned, and already, in law, a dead man. Some inquire to what period of his recorded history these circumstances relate. But there is no reason to think they were wrought into such conscious and explicit discovery at any period of his history before he "met the Lord in the way"; and though, "amidst the multitude of his thoughts within him" during his memorable three day's blindness immediately after that, such views of the law and of himself would doubtless be tossed up and down till they took shape much as they are here described (see on [2215]Ac 9:9) we regard this whole description of his inward struggles and progress rather as the finished result of all his past recollections and subsequent reflections on his unregenerate state, which he throws into historical form only for greater vividness. But now the apostle proceeds to repel false inferences regarding the law, secondly: Ro 7:14-25, in the case of the REGENERATE; taking himself here also as the example.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid:</span> another anticipation. The apostle denies that the holy law was in its own nature deadly, or the cause of death to him; the fault was not in the law, but in his own depraved nature: but the plain case is this that follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; </span> that sin, that so it might appear every way like itself, wrought death in him, by occasion of that law, which yet itself is holy, just, and good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful; </span> so as hereupon sin, which in the time of his ignorance and unregeneracy seemed not worthy of any notice, appeared to be exceeding foul and sinful. Sin is so evil, that he cannot call it by a worse name than its own. Jerome thinks, that the apostle here commits a solecism, by joining an adjective of the masculine gender with a substantive of the feminine; but Beza and Erasmus have observed, that this is usual in the Attic dialect. See the like, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a></span>. Some read sinner for <span class="ital">sinful, </span> and make the apostle to speak of sin as of a certain person; and therefore all along the context sin is said to work, to be dead, to revive, to deceive, to kill, &c., which is properly attributed to persons, and not to things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Was then that which is good, made death unto me?.... An objection is started upon the last epithet in commendation of the law; and it is as if the objector should say, if the law is good, as you say, how comes it to pass that it is made death, or is the cause of death to you? can that be good, which is deadly, or the cause of death? or can that be the cause of death which is good? This objection taken out of the mouth of another person proceeds upon a mistake of the apostle's meaning; for though he had said that he died when the commandment came, and found by experience that it was unto death, yet does not give the least intimation that the law was the cause of his death; at most, that it was only an occasion, and that was not given by the law, but taken by sin, which, and not the law, deceived him and slew him. Nor is it any objection to the goodness of the law, that it is a ministration of condemnation and death to sinners; for "lex non damnans, non est lex", a law without a sanction or penalty, which has no power to condemn and punish, is no law, or at least a law of no use and service; nor is the judge, or the sentence which he according to law pronounces upon a malefactor, the cause of his death, but the crime which he is guilty of; and the case is the same here, wherefore the apostle answers to this objection with abhorrence and detestation of fixing any such charge upon the law, as being the cause of death to him, saying, <p>God forbid; a way of speaking used by him, as has been observed, when anything is greatly disliked by him, and is far from his thoughts. Moreover, he goes on to open the true end and reason of sin, by the law working death in his conscience; <p>but sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that is, the vitiosity and corruption of nature, which is designed by sin, took an occasion, "by that which is good", that is, the law, through its prohibition of lust, to work in me all maimer of concupiscence, which brought forth fruit unto death; wherefore, upon the law's entrance into my heart and conscience, I received the sentence of death in myself, that so sin by it, "working death in me, might appear sin" to me, which I never knew before. This end was to be, and is answered by it, yea, <p>that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful; that the corruption of nature might not only be seen and known to be sin, but exceeding sinful; as being not only contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, but as taking occasion by the pure and holy law of God to exert itself the more, and so appear to be as the words  , may be rendered, "exceedingly a sinner", or "an exceeding great sinner"; that being the source and parent of all actual sins and transgressions; wherefore not the law, but sin, was the cause of death, which by the law is discovered to be so very sinful. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Was then that which is good <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> made death unto me?

The second clause with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα γένηται καθʼ ὑπερβολὴν ἁμαρτωλὸς ἡ ἁμαρτία</span>) seems co-ordinate with the first, yet intensifies it: personified sin not only appears, but actually turns out to be, beyond measure sinful through its perversion of the commandment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">that which is good</span>] These words are emphatic in the Gr.—He has said (<a href="/romans/7-10.htm" title="And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.">Romans 7:10</a>) that the commandment was found to be, in respect of him, “<span class="ital">unto</span> death.” Here he rejects the thought that it <span class="ital">was death;</span> a principle, or true cause, of death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">made</span>] The Gr. verb is simply <span class="bld">did it become</span>?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But sin</span>] Supply, <span class="bld">became death to me</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that it might</span>] Q. d., “it was permitted to do its work, that it might expose its true nature.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">appear</span>] i.e. <span class="bld">come out to light</span>, “shew in its real character.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">death</span>] i.e. practically, “condemnation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by that which is good</span>] Namely, the Law. The sacredness of the instrument enhances the evil of the agent which so uses it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">might become</span>] Not merely “might <span class="ital">appear</span>.” Sin, as it were, <span class="ital">surpasses itself</span> when it takes occasion from the pure Law to awake the soul’s resistance to the Blessed Lawgiver. Thus it “<span class="ital">becomes exceeding sinful</span> through the commandment;” and thus its developement is overruled to its effectual detection, which is the leading thought here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me?

It is no tautology; for that expression, <span class="ital">by that which is good</span>, superadds strength to the second part of this sentence.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα γένηται</span>, <span class="ital">that it might become</span>) This phrase is dependent on <span class="ital">working</span>. So <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>, repeated twice, forms a gradation. If any one should rather choose to make it an anaphora,[73] the second part of the sentence will thus also explain the first.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘʼ ὙΠΕΡΒΟΛῊΝ ἉΜΑΡΤΩΛῸς</span></span></span>) Castellio translates it, <span class="ital">as sinful as possible:</span> because, namely, [sin,] by <span class="ital">that which was</span> [<span class="ital">is</span>] <span class="ital">good, i.e.</span> by the commandment, works in me that which is <span class="ital">evil, i.e.</span> death.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ</span>, <span class="ital">by</span>) It is construed with <span class="ital">might become</span> [that sin <span class="ital">might by the commandment become</span> exceeding sinful].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] See Appendix.
