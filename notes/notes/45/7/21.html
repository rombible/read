In any case “<span class= "ital">a</span> law” should be rather “<span class= "ital">the</span> law.” This is taken by the majority of commentators, including Bishop Ellicott, in the sense of “rule,” “habitually-repeated fact.” “I find this law, or this rule, that when I would do good evil is present with me.” Such is my constant and regular experience. The objection to this interpretation is that it gives to the word “law” an entirely different sense from that which it bears in the context, or in any other part of St. Paul’s writings. The other view is that which is maintained by Dr. Vaughan. According to this we should have to assume an <span class= "ital">anacoluthon.</span> The Apostle begins the sentence as if he were going to say, “I find therefore the Law (the Mosaic law), when I desire to do good, <span class= "ital">unable to help me;”</span> but he changes somewhat the form of the sentence in the latter portion, and instead of saying “I find the Law unable to help me,” he says, “I find that evil is at my side.” “To me” is also repeated a second time, in the Greek superfluously, for the sake of greater clearness. Or perhaps a still simpler and better explanation would be that the Apostle had intended in the first instance to say, “I find the Law, when I wish to do good, <span class= "ital">putting evil before me</span>,” and then shrank (as in <a href="/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>) from using so harsh an expression, and softened it by turning the latter half of the sentence into a passive instead of an active form—“I find the Law, when I wish to do good—that evil <span class= "ital">is put</span> before me.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/7-21.htm" title="I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.">Romans 7:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">I find then a law </span>— An inward constraining power, flowing from my depraved nature; <span class="ital">that when I would </span>— When I incline and purpose to <span class="ital">do good, evil is present with me </span>— To prevent the execution of such a purpose. The expression, <span class="ital">when I would do good, </span>intimates that this inclination to do good was not permanent; it only arose on particular occasions. This is another feature of an unregenerate man; his inclinations and purposes to do good, and live to the glory of God, are only temporary. “They,” says Macknight, “who think the apostle is here describing his own case, and the case of other regenerated persons, should consider that he does not speak of single instances of omission of duty, and commission of sin; for the words which he uses all denote a continuation or <span class="ital">habit of acting. </span>Now how such a habit of doing evil and neglecting good can be attributed to any regenerated person, and especially to the Apostle Paul, who, before this Epistle to the Romans was written, told the Thessalonians, <span class="ital">Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and righteously, and unblameably we behaved among you, </span>I confess I do not comprehend. See also <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God....">2 Corinthians 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh....">2 Corinthians 10:2-3</a>. To elude the force of this argument, Augustine affirms that the apostle does not speak of his outward actions, but of the inward motions of his <span class="ital">concupiscence, </span>by which he means, <span class="ital">evil desire in general: </span>and that for the reason mentioned in the note on <a href="/romans/7-17.htm" title="Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:17</a>, he expresses these motions by the pronoun <span class="ital">I</span>. Be it so. On this supposition, <a href="/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.">Romans 7:15</a> will <span class="ital">mean, ‘What I, </span>my concupiscence, <span class="ital">thoroughly worketh, </span>in my mind, <span class="ital">I do not approve. For I, </span>my concupiscence, <span class="ital">practiseth not, </span>in my mind, <span class="ital">that to which I incline; but what I hate, that I, </span>my concupiscence, <span class="ital">doth.’ </span>Now, not to insist on the impropriety of applying words which denote outward actions, to motions of evil desire in the mind, I ask, what sense is there in the apostle’s telling us, that his concupiscence did not practise in his mind what he inclined to? For if what he inclined to was good, it could not possibly be practised by concupiscence, if concupiscence be <span class="ital">evil desire; </span>consequently, it was foolishness in him either to expect it from concupiscence, or to complain of the want of it, as he does <a href="/romans/7-19.htm" title="For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.">Romans 7:19</a>. He might complain of the existence of concupiscence in his mind; but if it were suffered to remain there uncontrolled, and if it hindered the actings of his sanctified will so effectually that he never did that to which he inclined, but always did the evil to which his sanctified will did not incline, is not this the clearest proof that concupiscence, or evil desire, was the prevailing principle in his mind, and that his sanctified will had no power to restrain its workings? Now could the apostle give any plainer description of an unregenerate person than this?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:18-22 The more pure and holy the heart is, it will have the more quick feeling as to the sin that remains in it. The believer sees more of the beauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I find then a law - There is a law whose operation I experience whenever I attempt to do good. There have been various opinions about the meaning of the word "law" in this place. It is evident that it is used here in a sense somewhat unusual. But it retains the notion which commonly attaches to it of what binds, or controls. And though this to which he refers differs from a law, inasmuch as it is not imposed by a superior, which is the usual idea of a law, yet it has so far the sense of law that it binds, controls, influences, or is that to which he was subject. There can be no doubt that he refers here to his carnal and corrupt nature; to the evil propensities and dispositions which were leading him astray. His representing this as a law is in accordance with all that he says of it, that it is servitude, that he is in bondage to it, and that it impedes his efforts to be holy and pure. The meaning is this, "I find a habit, a propensity, an influence of corrupt passions and desires, which, when I would do right, impedes my progress, and prevents my accomplishing what I would." Compare <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>. Every Christian is as much acquainted with this as was the apostle Paul.<p>Do good - Do right. Be perfect.<p>Evil - Some corrupt desire, or improper feeling, or evil propensity.<p>Is present with me - Is near; is at hand. It starts up unbidden, and undesired. It is in the path, and never leaves us, but is always ready to impede our going, and to turn us from our good designs; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-3.htm">Psalm 65:3</a>, "Iniquities prevail against me.' The sense is, that to do evil is agreeable to our strong natural inclinations and passions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19, 21. For, &c.&#8212;The conflict here graphically described between a self that "desires" to do good and a self that in spite of this does evil, cannot be the struggles between conscience and passion in the unregenerate, because the description given of this "desire to do good" in Ro 7:22 is such as cannot be ascribed, with the least show of truth, to any but the renewed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse hath greatly vexed interpreters. The apostle speaking simply and abstractly of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a law, </span> the question is: What law he means? Some take the word improperly, for a decree or condition, which was imposed upon him, and to which he was necessarily subject, that when he would do good, evil should be present with him. Others by <span class="ital">law</span> here do understand the law of sin; of which he speaks afterwards, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>,25</span>. Sin is like a law, and so powerful and imperious in its commands and dictates, that we have much ado, the best of us, to resist it, and shake off its yoke. q.d. I find by sad experience such a forcible power in sin, that when I would do good, I am hindered, and cannot do it so freely and fully as I desire. Others by <span class="ital">law</span> here do understand the law of God; and those that so understand it, have given no less than eight interpretations, to make the grammatical connexion: the best is of those that say the preposition kata is understood, a frequent ellipsis in the Greek tongue, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a></span>}</span> and then the sense is this; I find that when, according to the law or command of God, I would do good, evil is present with me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Evil is present with me; </span> another periphrasis of original sin, of which there are many in this chapter. Just now it was the sin that dwelleth in us, and here it is the evil that is present with us: it inheres and adheres, or hangs upon us continually. It is adjacent, so the Greek word signifies, and always at hand; we carry it about with us at all times, and into all places; whithersoever we go, it follows us; or, as it is here, in our doing of good it is a very great impediment to us. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I find then a law,.... This is to be understood either of the corruption of nature, which he found by experience to be in him; and which, because of its force, power, and prevalence it sometimes had in him, he calls "a law"; it forcibly demanding compliance with its lusts; and is the same with what he calls "evil", and which the Jews so frequently style  "the evil imagination", by which they mean the corruption of nature; and one of the seven names, and the first of them, by which it is called, they tell us (k), is,  "evil"; the very name it goes by here, and which they say God calls it, <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>; and well may it be so called, since it is originally, naturally, and continually evil; it is evil in its nature and consequences; it is the source and spring of all evil: <p>that when I would do good; says the apostle, as soon as any good thought arises in me, any good resolution is entered into by me, or I am about to do anything that is good, <p>evil, the vitiosity of nature, <p>is present with me, and hinders me; it came into the world with me, and it has continued with me ever since; it cleaves close unto me, it lies very nigh me, and whenever there is any motion to that which is good, it starts up, which seemed to lie asleep before, and exerts itself, so that I cannot do the good I would. The Jews say (l), there are , "two hearts" in man, the good imagination, and the evil imagination. The apostle here speaks as of two wills in regenerate men, one to good, and another to evil: or this may be understood of the law of God, which he found agreed with his mind, willing that which is good, though sin lay so near to him; or he found that willing that which was good was the law of God, very agreeable to it; and that the law was on his side, favouring him, encouraging him to that which is good, though sin kept so close to him; to which sense agree the following words. <p>(k) T.

Therefore, in short, wickedness and death are not of the law, but of sin, which reigns in those that are not regenerated: for they neither wish to do good, neither do they do good, but they wish and do evil: but in those that are regenerated, it strives against the spirit or law of the mind, so that they cannot live at all as well as they want to, or be as free of sin as they want to.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/7-21.htm" title="I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.">Romans 7:21</a>. Among the numerous interpretations of this passage, which Chrysostom terms <span class="greekheb">ἀσαφὲς εἰρημένον</span>, and the exposition of which has been given up as hopeless by van Hengel and Rückert, the following fall to be considered:—(1) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> taken generally as <span class="ital">rule</span>, necessity, and the like: “<span class="ital">I find therefore for me, who am desirous of doing the good, the rule</span>, the unavoidably determining element, <span class="ital">that evil lies before me;</span>” so that it is substantially the <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος νόμος ἐν τοῖς μέλεσι</span>, <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>, that is here meant. So, in the main, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Estius, Wolf, and others, including Ammon, Boehme, Flatt, Köllner, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Nielsen, Winer, Baur, Philippi, Tholuck, Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 379, Umbreit, Krummacher, Jatho, and the latest Catholic expositors, Reithmayr, Maier, and Bisping. But it is fatal to this view, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span>, in accordance with the entire context, can be nothing else than the <span class="ital">Mosaic</span> law, since a definition altering this wonted reference of the meaning is not appended, but is only introduced in <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a> by the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἕτερον</span>; further, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ἘΜΟῚ ΤῸ ΚΑΚῸΝ ΠΑΡΆΚΕΙΤΑΙ</span></span></span> is not a relation that presents itself in idea as a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΌΜΟς</span></span></span>, but, on the contrary, as something <span class="ital">empirical</span>, as a <span class="ital">phenomenon</span> of fact; and lastly, that we should have to expect <span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον</span>, in that case, only before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>. (2) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> understood of the <span class="ital">Mosaic</span> law: “<span class="ital">I find therefore in me, who am desirous of doing the law</span>, (namely) <span class="ital">the good, that evil lies before me</span>.” According to this view, consequently, <span class="greekheb">τὸ καλόν</span> is in apposition with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is the object of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὙΡΊΣΚΩ</span></span></span>.

But after what goes before (<a href="/context/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I....">Romans 7:15-20</a>), it is inconsistent with the context to separate <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὸ καλόν</span>; and, besides, the appositional view of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΚΑΛΌΝ</span></span></span> is a forced expedient, feebly introducing something quite superfluous, especially after the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> prefixed with full emphasis. (3) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> likewise taken of the <span class="ital">Mosaic</span> law, and <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> taken as <span class="ital">because: “I find therefore the law for me, who am disposed to do the good, because evil lies before me;” i.e.</span> I find therefore that the law, so far as I have the will to do what is good, is by my side concurring with me, because evil is present with me (and therefore I need the law as <span class="greekheb">συνήγορον</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΊΝΟΝΤΑ ΤῸ ΒΟΎΛΗΜΑ</span></span></span>, see Chrysostom).

The speaker thus declares what he recognises the law as being, “namely, <span class="ital">as that which to him, who is willing to do, is the good;</span>” and he finds it so, “<span class="ital">because the evil is at hand to him;</span>” when he “<span class="ital">comes to act</span>,” the evil is there also, and presents itself to him to be done; which contradiction between the thing willed and the thing lying to his hand makes him perceive the harmony between his willing and the law, so that, namely, he “<span class="ital">would be doing what he wills, if he were doing that which the law commands</span>.” This extremely tortuous explanation, which first of all imports the nucleus of the thought which is supposed to be expressed so enigmatically, breaks down at the very outset by its assumption that <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> is meant to stand <span class="ital">without object</span> (when I come to act!), although the object (comp. <a href="/context/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I....">Romans 7:15-20</a>) <span class="ital">stands beside it</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸ καλόν</span>) and according to the entire preceding context <span class="ital">necessarily belongs to it</span>,—a statement as to which nothing but exegetical subjectivity can pronounce the arbitrary verdict that it is “<span class="ital">groundless prejudice</span>.” (4) Ewald’s attributive reference of <span class="greekheb">τὸ κακόν</span> to the <span class="ital">law</span> is utterly erroneous: “<span class="ital">I find therefore the law, when I desire to do what is beautiful, how it lies at hand to me as the evil</span>.” Paul assuredly could not, even in this connection, have said <span class="greekheb">τὸ κακόν</span> of the divine law after <a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>; <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a>. (5) Abandoning all these views, I believe that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> is to be understood of the <span class="ital">Mosaic</span> law and joined with <span class="greekheb">τῷ θέλοντι</span>, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΙΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is to be taken as infinitive of the <span class="ital">purpose</span> (Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr</span>. p. 224), and <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as <span class="ital">object</span> of <span class="greekheb">εὑρίσκω</span> (comp. Esr. <a href="/romans/2-26.htm" title="Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?">Romans 2:26</a>): “<span class="ital">it results to me, therefore, that, while my will is directed to the law in order to do the good, the evil lies before me</span>.” What deep wretchedness! My moral will points to the law in order to do the good, but the evil is present with me in my fleshly nature, to make the <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> void! What I <span class="ital">will</span>, that I <span class="ital">cannot</span> do. In connection with this view, observe: (<span class="ital">a</span>) That the position of the words <span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοί</span> serves, without any harshness, to set forth <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span> emphatically, just as often also in classical writers the substantive with the article is emphatically prefixed to the participle with the article, on which it depends (see Kühner <span class="ital">ad Xen. Mem</span>. i. 6. 13; Bornemann and Kühner <span class="ital">ad Anab</span>. v. 6, 7; Krüger, § 50, 10. 1; Bernhardy, p. 461);—(<span class="ital">b</span>) That <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> with the accusative as object of the willing, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the moral striving and longing, of desire and love, is particularly frequent in the LXX. (see also <a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a> and the remark thereon); compare here, especially, <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 5:24</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἠθέλησαν τὸν νόμον κυρίου</span>. (<span class="ital">c</span>) Finally, how aptly the <span class="greekheb">συνήδομαι γὰρ τῷ νόμῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in the illustrative clause that follows, <a href="/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a>, harmonizes with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ Τῷ ΘΈΛΟΝΤΙ ἘΜΟΊ</span></span></span>; while the subsequent <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΛΈΠΩ ΔῈ ἝΤΕΡΟΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, in <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>, answers to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ἘΜΟῚ ΤῸ ΚΑΚῸΝ ΠΑΡΆΚΕΙΤΑΙ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">dative</span> <span class="greekheb">τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοί</span> is that of the <span class="ital">ethical reference:</span> deprehendo <span class="ital">mihi</span>, experience proves it to me.

The law, in short, which Paul has discovered by experience, is the constant fact that when his inclination is to do good, evil is present with him. This sense of law approximates very closely to the modern sense which the word bears in physical science—so closely that its very modernness may be made an objection to it. Possibly Paul meant, in using the word, to convey at the same time the idea of an outward compulsion put on him by sin, which expressed itself in this constant incapacity to do the good he inclined to—authority or constraint as well as normality being included in his idea of the word. But <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span> in Paul always seems to have much more definitely the suggestion of something with legislative authority: it is questionable whether the first meaning given above would have occurred, or would have seemed natural, except to a reader familiar with the phraseology of modern science. Besides, the subject of the whole paragraph is the relation of “the law” to sin, and the form of the sentence is quite analogous to that of <a href="/romans/7-10.htm" title="And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.">Romans 7:10</a>, in which a preliminary conclusion has been come to on the question. Hence I agree with those who make <span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον</span> the Mosaic law. The construction is not intolerable, if we observe that <span class="greekheb">εὑρίσκω ἄρα τὸν νόμον τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εὑρίσκεται ἄρα ὁ νόμος τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “This is what I find the law—or life under the law—to come to in experience: when I wish to do good, evil is present with me.” This is the answer he has already given in <a href="/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a> to the question, Is the law sin? No, it is not sin, but nevertheless sin is most closely connected with it. The repeated <span class="greekheb">ἐμοί</span> has something tragic in it: <span class="ital">me</span>, who am so anxious to do otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">I find then</span>, &c.] The Gr. construction of this verse is difficult. But the explanation is helped by remembering that <span class="bld">the law</span>, not “<span class="ital">a</span> law,” is the right version; and all analogy of passages leads us to refer this to the Divine Law. There can thus be little doubt of the practical meaning of the verse:—“such is the relation between me and the Law, that my will is with it, my action is against it.” The Gr. is (as nearly literally as possible), <span class="bld">So then I find the Law, with me willing to do what is good, [I find, I say,] that with me what is evil is present</span>. The construction is rapid and broken, but characteristic of St Paul. It is as if he had written, “I find the Law <span class="ital">thus</span> in its attitude; I find that what is evil is present with me, while yet my will is for the good.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He thus states, (what it is one main object, if not the chief of all, to state in this whole remarkable passage of the Epistle,) that the <span class="ital">subjugation of sin is not the function of the Law</span>. The awful holiness of the Law both evokes the resistance of sin, and (in the regenerate) ever more and more detects its presence in the minutest shades. Another Influence (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>) is needed, <span class="ital">side by side with this detection</span>, if sin is to be subdued.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Meyer suggests a rendering of the above clauses which is perfectly possible as regards construction, but in our view less natural, and less proper to the context: “I find then that with me, choosing [willing, lit.] the law, so as to do right, evil is present.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/7-21.htm" title="I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.">Romans 7:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὑρίσκω</span>) In this distressing conflict <span class="ital">I find</span> the law, [But Engl.

The first principles of harmony, friendship, and agreement between the law and man, are expressed with admirable nicety of language. The participle is purposely put first, <span class="greekheb">τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>, or <span class="ital">to the person willing</span>, viz. <span class="ital">me</span>,[77] in antithesis to the second [<span class="ital">with</span>] <span class="ital">me</span>, which presently after occurs absolutely.
