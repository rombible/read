It is not, quite strictly speaking, argument at all, but rather emphatic assertion, with all the weight of apostolic authority, and in a graphic illustrative form.

The apostle speaks of Christ as the husband of the believing Jews, because he was now become their Lord and head; and he calls him <span class="ital">another husband, </span>because they had been formerly, as it were, married to the Mosaic law, and relied on that alone for salvation. And the crucifixion of their old man, or corrupt nature, and their obtaining a new nature, through the death of Christ, was a fit preparation of them for being espoused to Christ. <span class="ital">Who is raised from the dead </span>— Who is alive himself, and will bestow spiritual life on those that believe on him, and give up themselves to him; <span class="ital">that we should bring forth fruit </span>— Namely, of holiness and good works, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; <span class="ital">unto God</span> — To his glory, <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>.

But from whatever source it was derived, it is a strong representation of the friendship and endearment which subsists, and to all eternity will subsist, between Christ and believers, and of the happiness which they will derive from his love to them, and from their entire subjection to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them. And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - This verse contains an application of the illustration in the two preceding. The idea there is, that death dissolves a connection from which obligation resulted. This is the single point of the illustration, and consequently there is no need of inquiring whether by the wife the apostle meant to denote the old man, or the Christian, etc. The meaning is, as death dissolves the connection between a wife and her husband, and of course the obligation of the law resulting from that connection, so the death of the Christian to the Law dissolves that connection, so far as the scope of the argument here is concerned, and prepares the way for another union, a union with Christ, from which a new and more efficient obligation results. The design is to show that the new connection would accomplish more important effects than the old.<p>Ye also are become dead to the law - Notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>, <a href="/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>. The connection between us and the Law is dissolved, so far as the scope of the apostle's argument is concerned. He does not say that we are dead to it, or released from it as a rule of duty, or as a matter of obligation to obey it; for there neither is, nor can be, any such release, but we are dead to it as a way of justification and sanctification. In the great matter of acceptance with God, we have ceased to rely on the Law, having become dead to it, and having embraced another plan.<p>By the body of Christ - That is, by his body crucified; or in other words, by his death; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>, "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity," etc. that is, by his death. <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>, "in the body of his flesh through death," etc. <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, "who bare our sins in his own body on the tree." The sense, is, therefore, that by the death of Christ as an atoning sacrifice; by his suffering for us what would be sufficient to meet the demands of the Law; by his taking our place, he has released us from the Law as a way of justification; freed us from its penalty; and saved us from its curse. Thus released, we are at liberty to be united to the law of him who has thus bought us with his blood.<p>That ye should be married to another - That you might be united to another, and come under his law. This is the completion of the illustration in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2-3</a>. As the woman that is freed from the law of her husband by his death, when married again comes under the authority of another, so we who are made free from the Law and its curse by the death of Christ, are brought under the new law of fidelity and obedience to him with whom we are thus united. The union of Christ and his people is not unfrequently illustrated by the most tender of all earthly connections, that of a husband and wife, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23-30</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>. "I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife," <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>.<p>Even to him who is raised ... - See the force of this explained, <a href="/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>.<p>That we should bring forth fruit unto God - That we should live a holy life. This is the point and scope of all this illustration. The new connection is such as will make us holy. It is also implied that the tendency of the Law was only to bring forth fruit unto death <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>, and that the tendency of the gospel is to make man holy and pure; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Wherefore &#8230; ye also are become dead&#8212;rather, "were slain."<p>to the law by the body of Christ&#8212;through His slain body. The apostle here departs from his usual word "died," using the more expressive phrase "were slain," to make it clear that he meant their being "crucified with Christ" (as expressed in Ro 6:3-6, and Ga 2:20).<p>that ye should be married to another, even to him that is&#8212;"was."<p>raised from the dead&#8212;to the intent.<p>that we should bring forth fruit unto God&#8212;It has been thought that the apostle should here have said that "the law died to us," not "we to the law," but that purposely inverted the figure, to avoid the harshness to Jewish ears of the death of the law [Chrysostom, Calvin, Hodge, Philippi, &c.]. But this is to mistake the apostle's design in employing this figure, which was merely to illustrate the general principle that "death dissolves legal obligation." It was essential to his argument that we, not the law, should be the dying party, since it is we that are "crucified with Christ," and not the law. This death dissolves our marriage obligation to the law, leaving us at liberty to contract a new relation&#8212;to be joined to the Risen One, in order to spiritual fruitfulness, to the glory of God [Beza, Olshausen, Meyer, Alford, &c.]. The confusion, then, is in the expositors, not the text; and it has arisen from not observing that, like Jesus Himself, believers are here viewed as having a double life&#8212;the old sin-condemned life, which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance and holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head; and all the issues of this new life, in Christian obedience, are regarded as the "fruit" of this blessed union to the Risen One. How such holy fruitfulness was impossible before our union to Christ, is next declared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/romans/7-3.htm" title="So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.">Romans 7:3</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also,.... Here the apostle accommodates the foregoing instance and example to the case in hand, showing, that the saints were not under the law, the power and dominion of it; since that, as when a man is dead, the woman is loosed from that law by which she was bound whilst he lived, that she may lawfully marry another man, and bear children to him without the imputation of adultery; so believers being dead to the law, and the law dead to them, which is all one, they are loosed from it, and may be, and are lawfully married to Christ, that they may bring forth the genuine fruits of good works, not in order to obtain righteousness and life by them, but for the honour and glory of God; in which account may be observed, an assertion that the saints and children of God <p>are become dead to the law, and that to them, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>, and can have no more power over them than a law can have over dead persons, or a dead abrogated law can have over living ones. They are represented as "dead to sin", and "dead with Christ", <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>; and here, "dead to the law", as in <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>, and consequently cannot be under it; are out of the reach of its power and government, since that only has dominion over a man as long as be lives the law is dead to them; it has no power over them, to threaten and terrify them into obedience to it; nor even rigorously to exact it, or command it in a compulsory way; nor is there any need of all this, since believers delight in it after the inward man, and serve it with their minds freely and willingly; the love of Christ, and not the terrors of the law, constrains them to yield a cheerful obedience to it; it has no power to charge and accuse them, curse or condemn them, or minister death unto them, no, not a corporeal one, as a penal evil, and much less an eternal one. And the way and means by which they become dead to the law, and that to them is, <p>by the body of Christ; not by Christ, as the body or substance of the ceremonial law; see <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>; since that is not singly designed, but the whole law of Moses; but by "the body of Christ", is either meant Christ himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>, or rather the human nature of Christ, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>, in which the law meets with every thing it can require and demand, as holiness of nature, which is the saints' sanctification in Christ; obedience of life, which is their righteousness; and sufferings of death, which is the penalty the law enjoins, whereby full expiation of sin is made, complete pardon is procured, and eternal redemption obtained; so that the law has nothing more to demand; its mouth is stopped, it is not in its power to curse and damn believers, they are dead to that, and that to them: the reason why the law is become so to them, and they to that, is, <p>that ye should be married to another; or "that ye should be to another", or "be another's"; that is, that ye should appear to be so in a just and legal way; for they were another's, they were Christ's before by the Father's gift, and were secretly married to him in the everlasting covenant, before he assumed their nature, and in the body of his flesh bore their sins, satisfied law and justice, paid their debts, and so freed them from the power of the law, its curse and condemnation, or any obligation to punishment; all which was done in consequence of his interest in them, and their marriage relation to him; but here respect is had to their open marriage to him in time, the day of their espousals in conversion; to make way for which, the law, their former husband, must be dead, and they dead to that, that so their marriage to Christ might appear lawful and justifiable; who is very fitly described by him, <p>who is raised from the dead; and is a living husband, and will ever continue so, will never die more; and therefore as the saints can never be loosed from the marriage bond of union between Christ and them, so they can never be loosed from the law of this husband; wherefore though they are dead to the law as a covenant of works, and as ministered by Moses, and are free from any obligation to it, as so considered, yet they are "under the law to Christ", <a href="/1_corinthians/9-21.htm">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>; under obligation, by the ties of love, to obedience to it, and shall never be loosed from it. The end of being dead to the law, and of being married to Christ, is, <p>that we should bring forth fruit unto God. The allusion is to children being called "the fruit of the womb", <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>, and here designs good works, the fruits of righteousness, which are brought forth by persons espoused to Christ, under the influence of the Spirit and grace of God; and they are "unto God", that is, for the honour and glory of God; meaning either Christ the husband of believers, who is God over all blessed for ever; or God the Father, to whose praise and glory they are by Christ; and which is a reason and argument which strongly excites and encourages the saints to the performance of them: and let it be observed, that as children begotten and born in lawful marriage are only true and legitimate, and all before marriage are spurious and illegitimate; so such works only are the true and genuine fruits of righteousness, which are in consequence of a marriage relation to Christ; are done in faith, spring from love, and are directed to the glory of God; and all others, which are done before marriage to Christ, and without faith in him, are like spurious and illegitimate children. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <i>even</i> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> fruit unto <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> God.</span><p>(2) An application of the similitude of marriage.

For if Christ became <span class="ital">through His bodily death</span> our deliverer from the law, we cannot now belong to Him otherwise than as the <span class="ital">Risen One</span> for a new and indissoluble union. The importance of this addition in its bearing on the matter in hand lies in the <span class="greekheb">καινότης ζωῆς</span> (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>; <a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>; <a href="/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a>) which, on the very ground of the ethical communion with the Risen One, issues from the new relation. Certainly the death of Christ appears here “as the end of a sin-conditioned state of the humanity to be united in Him” (Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 354); but this great moral epoch has as its necessary presupposition just the vicarious atoning power of the <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> which was rendered in the death of Jesus; it could not take place without this and without the faith appropriating it, <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a> ff.; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα καρποφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεῷ</span>] The <span class="ital">aim</span> not of <span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγερθέντι</span> (Koppe, Th.

There is here (though van Hengel and others call it in question, contrary to the clear connection) a continuation of the figure of marriage with respect to its <span class="ital">fruitfulness</span> (<a href="/luke/1-42.htm" title="And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.">Luke 1:42</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm" title="See, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.">Psalm 127:3</a>, Symm. and Theod. <a href="/psalms/91-15.htm" title="He shall call on me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him.">Psalm 91:15</a>). The morally holy walk, namely, in its consecration to God is, as it were, the fruit which issues from our fellowship of life with Christ risen from the dead as from a new marriage-union, and which <span class="ital">belongs in property</span> to God as the lord-paramount of that union (the supreme ruler of the Messianic theocracy); the bringing forth of fruit takes place <span class="ital">for God</span>. The opinion of Reiche and Fritzsche that <span class="greekheb">καρποφ</span>. taken in the sense of the <span class="ital">fruit of marriage</span> yields an <span class="ital">undignified</span> allegory (the figure therefore is to be taken as borrowed from a field or a tree, which Philippi, Tholuck, and Reithmayr also prefer) is untenable, seeing that the union with Christ, if regarded as a <span class="ital">marriage</span> at all, must also necessarily, in accordance with its moral design, be conceived of as a <span class="ital">fruitful marriage</span>.[1539]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1534] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1535] This is expressed from the <span class="ital">Jewish-Christian</span> consciousness, nevertheless it includes indirectly the <span class="ital">Gentile-Christians</span> also; for without perfect obedience to the law <span class="ital">no man</span> could have attained to salvation, wherefore also obedience to the law was expected on the part of Judaists from the converted Gentiles (Acts 15). As the argument advances, the language of the Apostle becomes <span class="ital">communicative</span>, so that he includes himself with his readers, among whom he makes no distinction. Compare <a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.

Theodoret already has the right view: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπειδὴ συνάφειαν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γάμον τὴν εἰς τὸν κύριον προσηγόρευσε πίστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰκότως δείκνυσι καὶ τὸν τοῦ γάμου καρπόν</span>.

Theophylact.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὥστε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐθανατώθητε τῷ νόμῳ</span>: the inference is drawn rather from the principle than from the example, but <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> means “you as well as the woman in the illustration,” not “you Gentiles as well as I a Jew”. The last, which is Weiss’s interpretation, introduces a violent contrast of which there is not the faintest hint in the context. The meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἐθανατώθητε</span> is fixed by reference to chap. <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?...">Romans 6:3-6</a>. The aorist refers to the definite time at which in their baptism the old life (and with it all its legal obligations) came to an end. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χτοῦ</span>: Weiss rejects as opposed to the context the “dogmatic” reference to the sacrificial death of Christ as a satisfaction for sin; all the words imply, according to him, is that the Christian, in baptism, experiences a <span class="greekheb">ὁμοίωμα</span> of Christ’s death, or as it is put in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a> is crucified with Him, and so liberated from every relation to the law. But if Christ’s death had no spiritual content—if it were not a death “for our sins” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>), a death having the sacrificial character and atoning virtue described in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a> f.—there would be no reason why a sinful man should be baptised into Christ and His death at all, and in point of fact no one <span class="ital">would</span> be baptised. It is because Christ’s death is what it is, a sin-expiating death, that it draws men to Him, and spiritually reproduces in them a reflex or counterpart of His death, with which all their old relations and obligations terminate. The object of this is that they may belong to another, a different person. Paul does not say <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρῳ ἀνδρί</span>: the marriage metaphor is dropped. He is speaking of the experience of Christians one by one, and though Christ is sometimes spoken of as the husband or bridegroom of the Church, there is no Scripture authority for using this metaphor of His relation to the individual soul. Neither is this interpretation favoured by the use of <span class="greekheb">καρποφορήσωμεν</span>; to interpret this of the fruit of the new marriage is both needless and grotesque. The word is used frequently in the N.T. for the outcome of the Christian life, but never with this association; and a reference to <a href="/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a> shows how natural it is to the Apostle without any such prompting. Even the change from the second person (<span class="greekheb">ἐθανατώθητε</span>) to the first (<span class="greekheb">καρποφορήσωμεν</span>) shows that he is contemplating the end of the Christian life quite apart from the suggestions of the metaphor. Christ is described as <span class="greekheb">τῷ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγερθέντι</span>, because we can only belong to a living person. <span class="greekheb">τῷ θεῷ</span> is <span class="ital">dat comm</span> God is the person interested in this result.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore</span>] The word marks transition from the facts to the spiritual inference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are become dead</span>] Lit., and better, <span class="bld">were made dead</span>; a passive verb, suggesting the external, objective work which caused their “death;” viz., the Death of their Representative and Head, the Second Adam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to the law</span>] To its claim on you as a covenant of salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the body of Christ</span>] Which was slain for you. No reference to the mystical Body, the Church, (<a href="/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>; 1 Corinthians 10; Eph.; Col.;) is to be sought here. The word “<span class="ital">body</span>” is used, instead of “<span class="ital">death</span>,” probably to remind the readers that the Lord “took our nature upon Him” <span class="ital">expressly in view of His death</span>. (See <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>.) Meanwhile the truth of the connexion between believers and their Head, their Second Adam, is still full in view. By virtue of it the death of the Lord counts as the death of His brethren, in respect of the claim of the Law upon them—here figured as the claim of one marriage-partner over the other, to be broken only by the death of one of the two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to another</span>] i.e., another than the Law, now regarded as defunct in respect of its claim on them. Observe that the metaphorical language here is not strictly consistent. In <a href="/context/romans/7-2.htm" title="For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband....">Romans 7:2-3</a>, the death of the husband is contemplated; in <a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a> the death of the wife. The change may be explained partly by St Paul’s desire to avoid an expression so easily misunderstood as the <span class="ital">death of the Law</span> (see on <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>); and partly by the unique character of the spiritual fact illustrated here by a new marriage; viz. the <span class="ital">death and resurrection</span> (in her Representative, who now becomes her Husband also,) of the mystical Bride.—The change in the metaphor, whatever its cause, leaves it unchanged as an illustration.—The figure of Marriage, passingly employed here, (and still more so, <a href="/context/galatians/4-21.htm" title="Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?...">Galatians 4:21-31</a>,) is worked out more fully in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>, &c., and in the Revelation. It is largely foreshadowed in O. T.; e.g. in Psalms 45; Canticles; Isaiah 54; Jeremiah 3; and in the many passages where idolatry is pictured by sin against wedlock.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to him who is raised</span>] The Lord’s resurrection is here brought in, because the “death” (in Him) of His people has just been mentioned. The thought suggests both that they are “risen in Him” to the life of peace with God, and that they partake with Him, as their Risen Head, “the power of an endless life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fruit</span>] <span class="bld">offspring</span>. The metaphor is carried into detail. (See for a parallel of more elaboration, <a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">James 1:15</a>.) The “offspring” here is, obviously, the “fruit of the Spirit” (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>), Christian virtues; just as the “offspring” of the former marriage had been acts of sin (<a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto God</span>] The Father, not Christ.
