For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Professing themselves to be wise - This was the common boast of the philosophers of antiquity.

In what way they evinced their folly, Paul proceeds immediately to state. Sinners of all kinds are frequently spoken of as fools in the Scriptures. In the sense in which it is thus used, the word is applied to them as void of understanding or moral sense; as idolaters, and as wicked; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm">Proverbs 1:17</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-8.htm">Proverbs 14:8-9</a>.

Others think the words refer to the heathen philosophers, who though they were learned and wise in secular and natural things, yet they became fools in spiritual and heavenly matters; though they well understood the creature, yet they erred concerning the Creator. And as fools delight in toys, neglecting things of great value; so they set up puppets and idols of their own devising, in the room of the true God; which the apostle gives us in the next verse, as a demonstration of their folly. Socrates, who was accounted one of the wisest amongst them, desired his friends, when he was about to die, to offer for him a cock to Aesculapius, which he had vowed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Professing themselves to be wise,....

For heathenism is not the primeval religion, from which man might gradually have risen to the knowledge of the true God, but is, on the contrary, the result of a falling away from the known original revelation of the true God in His works.

Mankind is regarded as having lost a truer perception of God once possessed, idolatry being a sign of culpable degradation of the human race - not, as some would have us now believe, a stage in man's emergence from brutality. Scripture ever represents the human race as having fallen and become degraded; not as having risen gradually to any intelligent conceptions of God at all. And it may well be asked whether modern anthropological science has really discovered anything to discredit the scriptural view of the original condition and capacity of man. The view here presented is that obfuscation of the understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) ensued from refusal to <span class="accented">glorify</span> and <span class="accented">give thanks to</span> known Deity. "<span class="accented">Gratias assere</span> debemns ob beneficia; <span class="accented">glorificare</span> ob ipsas virtutes divinas" (Bengel). Hence came <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, a word, with its correlatives, constantly used with reference to idolatry; cf. <a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; also in the Old Testament, <a href="/1_kings/16-26.htm">1 Kings 16:26</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.), <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.); <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; <a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;</span>). Two forms of idolatry - both involving unworthy conceptions of the Divine Being - are alluded to, suggested, we may suppose, by the anthropomorphism of the Greeks and the creature-worship of Egypt, which were the two notable and representative developments of heathen religion. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, with the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, have led some to suppose in this whole passage a special reference to the schools of philosophy. But this is not so. The degradation spoken of was long anterior to them, nor is this charge, as formulated, applicable to them. The idea is, generally, that boasted human intellect has not preserved men from folly; not even "the wisdom of the Egyptians," or the intellectual culture of the Greeks (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 3:19, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Professing (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>The verb is used of unfounded assertion, <a href="/acts/24-9.htm">Acts 24:9</a>; <a href="/acts/25-19.htm">Acts 25:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>.<p>Wise, they became fools<p>Another oxymoron; see on <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>. Compare Horace, insaniens sapientia raving wisdom.
