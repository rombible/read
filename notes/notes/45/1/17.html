The essential part on man’s side, the beginning and end of that plan, is Faith. For which there was authority in the Old Testament, where it is said, “The just shall live by faith.”<p><span class= "bld">The righteousness of God.</span>—By this is not meant, as might, perhaps, be supposed, an attribute of the divine nature—as if the essential righteousness of God were first made known through the gospel. St. Paul goes on to show in <a href="/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19-20</a>, that so much at least of the nature of God might be known without any supernatural revelation. “Of God” means in the present instance “which proceeds from God.” And the “righteousness” which thus “proceeds from God” is that condition of righteousness in man into which he enters by his participation in the Messianic kingdom. The whole object of the coming of the Messiah was to make men “righteous” before God. This was done more especially by the death of Christ upon the cross, which, as we learn from <a href="/context/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24-26</a>, had the effect of making God “propitious” towards men. The benefit of this act is secured to all who make good their claim to be considered members of the Messianic kingdom by a loyal adhesion to the Messiah. Such persons are treated as if they were “righteous,” though the righteousness that is thus attributed to them is not any actual merit of their own, but an ideal condition in which they are placed by God. This is the well-known doctrine of justification by faith. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: On the Meaning of the word Righteousness in the Epistle to the Romans,</span> and <span class= "ital">Excursus E: On the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and Imputed Righteousness.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Revealed.</span>—God’s purpose of thus justifying men is in process of being revealed or declared in the gospel. It is revealed theoretically in the express statements of the way in which man may be justified. It is revealed practically in the heartfelt acceptance of those statements and the change of life which they involved. To the Romans the moment of revelation was that in which they first heard the gospel. St. Paul wishes them to know the full significance—the philosophy, as it might be called—of that which they had heard.<p><span class= "bld">From faith to faith</span>.—It is by faith that man first lays hold on the gospel, and its latest product is a heightened and intensified faith. Apart from faith, the gospel remains null and void for the individual. It is not realised. But when it has been once realised and taken home to the man’s self, its tendency is to confirm and strengthen that very faculty by which it was apprehended. It does that for which the disciples prayed when they said, “Lord, increase our faith” (<a href="/luke/17-5.htm" title="And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.">Luke 17:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The just shall live by faith.</span>—The words are part of the consolatory answer which the prophet Habakkuk receives in the stress of the Chaldean invasion. Though his irresistible hosts sweep over the land, the righteous man who puts his trust in God shall live. Perhaps St. Paul intended the words “by faith” to be taken rather with “the just” than as they stand in the English version. “The just by faith,” or “The man whose righteousness is based on faith,” shall live.<p>The Apostle uses the word “faith” in his own peculiar and pregnant sense. But this is naturally led up to by the way in which it was used by Habakkuk. The intense personal trust and reliance which the Jew felt in the God of his fathers is directed by the Christian to Christ, and is further developed into an active energy of devotion.<p>“Faith,” as understood by St. Paul, is not merely head-belief, a purely intellectual process such as that of which St. James spoke when he said “the devils also believe and tremble”; neither is it merely “trust,” a passive dependence upon an Unseen Power; but it is a further stage of feeling developed out of these, a current of emotion setting strongly in the direction of its object, an ardent and vital apprehension of that object, and a firm and loyal attachment to it. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed </span>— This expression sometimes means God’s essential, eternal righteousness, including both his holiness and justice, especially the latter, of which, together with his mercy, the word is explained, <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a>; where we read, <span class="ital">To declare his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus; </span>this his essential righteousness being eminently shown in condemning sin, and in justifying the penitent, believing sinner.

The meaning of the apostle, in the verse now under consideration, would be more manifest if his words were more literally translated, which they are by Doddridge and Macknight, thus: <span class="ital">For in it </span>(namely, the gospel) <span class="ital">the righteousness of God by faith is revealed to </span>our <span class="ital">faith, </span>or, <span class="ital">in order to faith. </span>“This translation,” says the latter of these divines, “which results from construing the words properly, affords a clear sense of a passage which, in the common translation, is absolutely unintelligible. Besides, it is shown to be the right translation by other passages of Scripture, in which the expression, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσυνη εκ πιστεως</span>, <span class="ital">righteousness by faith, </span>is found, <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="/romans/9-30.htm" title="What shall we say then?

For if men gave that obedience, it would be their own righteousness, and they might claim reward as a debt.” We may observe, further, the righteousness of faith is termed <span class="ital">the righteousness of God, </span>because God appointed and prepared it, reveals and gives, approves and crowns it. It is said to be <span class="ital">revealed, </span>because, whereas it was but obscurely intimated to the Jews, in the covenant with Abraham, and in the types of the Mosaic law; it is now clearly manifested in the gospel to all mankind. The expression, in our translation, <span class="ital">from faith to faith, </span>is interpreted by some of a gradual series of still clearer and clearer discoveries; but the translation of the clause given above, namely, <span class="ital">the righteousness of God by faith is revealed in order to faith, </span>seems evidently to express better the apostle’s meaning. <span class="ital">As it is written </span>— St. Paul had just laid down three propositions: 1st, Righteousness is by faith, <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; Romans 2 d, Salvation is by righteousness, <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; Romans 3 d, Both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>. Now all these are confirmed by that single sentence, <span class="ital">The just shall live by faith: </span>which was primarily spoken of those who preserved their lives, when the Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem, by believing the declarations of God, and acting according to them. Here it means, he shall obtain the favour of God, and continue therein, by believing. The words, however, may with propriety be rendered, <span class="ital">The just by faith, </span>that is, they who by faith are just, or righteous, (as <span class="greekheb">δικαιοι </span>signifies,) <span class="ital">shall live. </span>“This translation is agreeable both to the order of the words in the original, and the apostle’s design; which is to show that the doctrine of the gospel, concerning <span class="ital">a righteousness by faith, </span>is attested even by the prophets. Besides, it represents Habakkuk’s meaning more truly than the common translation. For in the passage from which the quotation is made, Habakkuk describes the different dispositions of the Jews about the time they were threatened by the Chaldeans. Some of <span class="ital">their souls were lifted up; </span>they presumptuously trusted in their own wisdom and power, and, contrary to God’s command, refused to submit to the Chaldeans, and were destroyed. But <span class="ital">the just, </span>or <span class="ital">righteous, by faith, </span>who believed God and obeyed his command, <span class="ital">lived. </span>However, as the reward of faith is not confined to the present life, persons who are just or good, by believing and obeying God, shall certainly live eternally.” — Macknight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:16,17 In these verses the apostle opens the design of the whole epistle, in which he brings forward a charge of sinfulness against all flesh; declares the only method of deliverance from condemnation, by faith in the mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and then builds upon it purity of heart, grateful obedience, and earnest desires to improve in all those Christian graces and tempers, which nothing but a lively faith in Christ can bring forth. God is a just and holy God, and we are guilty sinners. It is necessary that we have a righteousness to appear in before him: there is such a righteousness brought in by the Messiah, and made known in the gospel; a gracious method of acceptance, notwithstanding the guilt of our sins. It is the righteousness of Christ, who is God, coming from a satisfaction of infinite value. Faith is all in all, both in the beginning and progress of Christian life. It is not from faith to works, as if faith put us into a justified state, and then works kept us in it; but it is all along from faith to faith; it is faith pressing forward, and gaining the victory over unbelief.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - This word implies that he is now about to give a "reason" for what he had just said, a reason why he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. That reason is stated in this verse. It embodies the substance of all that is contained in the Epistle. It is the doctrine which he seeks to establish; and there is not perhaps a more important passage in the Bible than this verse; or one more difficult to be understood.<p>Therein - In it, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;  en houto&#772;, that is, in the gospel.<p>Is the righteousness of God - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  dikaiosune&#772; Theou. There is not a more important expression to be found in the Epistle than this. It is capable of only the following interpretations.<p>(1) some have said that it means that the attribute of God which is denominated righteousness or justice, is here displayed. It has been supposed that this was the design of the gospel to make this known; or to evince his justice in his way of saving people. There is an important sense in which this is true <a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>. But this does not seem to be the meaning in the passage before us. For,<p>(a) The leading design of the gospel is not to evince the justice of God, or the attribute of justice, but the love of God; see <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>.<p>(b) The attribute of justice is not what is principally evinced in the gospel. It is rather mercy, "or mercy in a manner consistent with justice," or that does not interfere with justice.<p>(c) The passage, therefore, is not designed to teach simply that the righteousness of God, as an attribute, is brought forth in the gospel, or that the main idea is to reveal his justice.<p>(2) a second interpretation which has been affixed to it is, to make it the same as goodness, the benevolence of God is revealed, etc. But to this there are still stronger objections. For.<p>(a) It does not comport with the design of the apostle's argument.<p>(b) It is a departure from the established meaning of the word "justice," and the phrase "the righteousness of God."<p>(c) If this had been the design, it is remarkable that the usual words expressive of goodness or mercy had not been used. Another meaning, therefore, is to be sought as expressing the sense of the phrase.<p>(3) the phrase "righteousness of God" is equivalent to God's "plan of justifying people; his scheme of declaring them just in the sight of the Law; or of acquitting them from punishment, and admitting them to favor." In this sense it stands opposed to man's plan of justification, that is, by his own works: God's plan is by faith. The way in which that is done is revealed in the gospel. The object contemplated to be done is to treat people as if they were righteous. Man attempted to accomplish this by obedience to the Law. The plan of God was to arrive at it by faith. Here the two schemes differ; and the great design of this Epistle is to show that man cannot be justified on his own plan, to wit, by works; and that the plan of God is the only way, and a wise and glorious way of making man just in the eye of the Law. No small part of the perplexity usually attending this subject will be avoided if it is remembered that the discussion in this Epistle pertains to the question, "how can mortal man be just with God?" The apostle shows that it cannot be by works; and that it "can be" by faith. This latter is what he calls the "righteousness of God" which is revealed in the gospel.<p>To see that this is the meaning, it is needful only to look at the connection; and at the usual meaning of the words. The word to "justify," &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  dikaioo&#772;, means properly "to be just, to be innocent, to be righteous." It then means to "declare," or treat as righteous; as when a man is charged with an offence. and is acquitted. If the crime alleged is not proved against him, he is declared by the Law to be innocent. It then means to "treat as if innocent, to regard as innocent;" that is, to pardon, to forgive, and consequently to treat as if the offence had not occurred. It does not mean that the man did not commit the offence; or that the Law might not have held him answerable for it; but that the offence is forgiven; and it is consistent to receive the offender into favor, and treat him as if he had not committed it. In what way this may be done rests with him who has the pardoning power. And in regard to the salvation of man, it rests solely with God. and must be done in that way only which he appoints and approves. The design of Paul in this Epistle is to show how this is done, or to show that it is done by faith. It may be remarked here that the expression before us does not imply any particular manner in which it is done; it does not touch the question whether it is by imputed righteousness or not; it does not say that it is on legal principles; it simply affirms "that the gospel contains God's plan of justifying people by faith."<p>The primary meaning of the word is, therefore, "to be innocent, pure, etc." and hence, the name means "righteousness" in general. For this use of the word, see <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-32.htm">Matthew 21:32</a>; <a href="/luke/1-75.htm">Luke 1:75</a>; <a href="/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>; <a href="/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>; <a href="/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>, etc.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed&#8212;that is (as the whole argument of the Epistle shows), God's justifying righteousness.<p>from faith to faith&#8212;a difficult clause. Most interpreters (judging from the sense of such phrases elsewhere) take it to mean, "from one degree of faith to another." But this agrees ill with the apostle's design, which has nothing to do with the progressive stages of faith, but solely with faith itself as the appointed way of receiving God's "righteousness." We prefer, therefore, to understand it thus: "The righteousness of God is in the gospel message, revealed (to be) from (or 'by') faith to (or 'for') faith," that is, "in order to be by faith received." (So substantially, Melville, Meyer, Stuart, Bloomfield, &c.).<p>as it is written&#8212;(Hab 2:4).<p>The just shall live by faith&#8212;This golden maxim of the Old Testament is thrice quoted in the New Testament&#8212;here; Ga 3:11; Heb 10:38&#8212;showing that the gospel way of "LIFE BY FAITH," so far from disturbing, only continued and developed the ancient method.<p>On the foregoing verses, Note (1) What manner of persons ought the ministers of Christ to be, according to the pattern here set up: absolutely subject and officially dedicated to the Lord Jesus; separated unto the gospel of God, which contemplates the subjugation of all nations to the faith of Christ: debtors to all classes, the refined and the rude, to bring the gospel to them all alike, all shame in the presence of the one, as well as pride before the other, sinking before the glory which they feel to be in their message; yearning over all faithful churches, not lording it over them, but rejoicing in their prosperity, and finding refreshment and strength in their fellowship! (2) The peculiar features of the gospel here brought prominently forward should be the devout study of all who preach it, and guide the views and the taste of all who are privileged statedly to hear it: that it is "the gospel of God," as a message from heaven, yet not absolutely new, but on the contrary, only the fulfilment of Old Testament promise, that not only is Christ the great theme of it, but Christ in the very nature of God as His own Son, and in the nature of men as partaker of their flesh&#8212;the Son of God now in resurrection&#8212;power and invested with authority to dispense all grace to men, and all gifts for the establishment and edification of the Church, Christ the righteousness provided of God for the justification of all that believe in His name; and that in this glorious Gospel, when preached as such, there resides the very power of God to save Jew and Gentile alike who embrace it. (3) While Christ is to be regarded as the ordained Channel of all grace from God to men (Ro 1:8), let none imagine that His proper divinity is in any respect compromised by this arrangement, since He is here expressly associated with "God the Father," in prayer for "grace and peace" (including all spiritual blessings) to rest upon this Church (Ro 1:7). (4) While this Epistle teaches, in conformity with the teaching of our Lord Himself, that all salvation is suspended upon faith, this is but half a truth, and will certainly minister to self-righteousness, if dissociated from another feature of the same truth, here explicitly taught, that this faith in God's own gift&#8212;for which accordingly in the case of the Roman believers, he "thanks his God through Jesus Christ" (Ro 1:8). (5) Christian fellowship, as indeed all real fellowship, is a mutual benefit; and as it is not possible for the most eminent saints and servants of Christ to impart any refreshment and profit to the meanest of their brethren without experiencing a rich return into their bosoms, so just in proportion to their humility and love will they feel their need of it and rejoice in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It will give light to this whole Epistle, to explain what is here meant by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the righteousness of God.</span> Some do thereby understand the whole doctrine of salvation and eternal life, which is revealed in the gospel; and they make it the same with <span class="ital">the faith of God, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a></span>, and with <span class="ital">the truth of God, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a></span>.

The words are variously interpreted: from the fiath of the Old Testament to the faith of the New; so that no person ever was or shall be justified in any other way. Or, from a lesser faith to a greater; not noting two faiths, but one and the same faith increasing to perfection. He saith not, from faith to works, or from works to faith; but <span class="ital">from faith to faith, </span> i.e. only by faith. The words <span class="ital">to be</span> must be understood: q.d. The gospel reveals the righteousness of God <span class="ital">to be</span> from faith to faith.

There is some diffculty to understand the fitness of this testimony to prove the conclusion in hand; for it is evident, that the prophet Habakkuk, in whom these words are found, doth speak of a temporal preservation; and what is that to eternal life? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answer.</span> The Babylonian captivity figured out our spiritual bondage under sin and Satan; and deliverance from that calamity did shadow forth our deliverance from hell, to be procured by Christ: compare <span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins....">Isaiah 40:2-4</a></span>, with <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a></span>.

By "the righteousness of God", is not meant the essential righteousness of God, the rectitude of his nature, his righteousness in fulfilling his promises, and his punitive justice, which though revealed in the Gospel, yet not peculiar to it; nor the righteousness by which Christ himself is righteous, either as God, or as Mediator; but that righteousness which he wrought out by obeying the precepts, and bearing the penalty of the law in the room of his people, and by which they are justified in the sight of God: and this is called "the righteousness of God", in opposition to the righteousness of men: and because it justifies men in the sight of God; and because of the concern which Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, have in it. Jehovah the Father sent his Son to work it out, and being wrought out, he approves and accepts of it, and imputes it to his elect: Jehovah the Son is the author of it by his obedience and death; and Jehovah the Spirit discovers it to sinners, works faith in them to lay hold upon it, and pronounces the sentence of justification by it in their consciences. Now this is said to be "revealed" in the Gospel, that is, it is taught in the Gospel; that is the word of righteousness, the ministration of it; it is manifested in and by the Gospel. This righteousness is not known by the light of nature, nor by the law of Moses; it was hid under the shadows of the ceremonial law, and is brought to light only by the Gospel; it is hid from every natural man, even from the most wise and prudent, and from God's elect themselves before conversion, and is only made known to believers, to whom it is revealed: <p>from faith to faith; that is, as say some, from the faith of God to the faith of men; from the faith of preachers to the faith of hearers; from the faith of the Old to the faith of the New Testament saints; or rather from one degree of faith to another; for faith, as it grows and increases, has clearer sights of this righteousness, as held forth in the Gospel. For the proof of this, a passage of Scripture is cited, <p>as it is written, <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>; <p>the just shall live by faith: "a just", or righteous man is, not everyone who thinks himself, or is thought by others to be so; nor are any so by their obedience to the law of works; but he is one that is made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, which is before said to be revealed in the Gospel. The life which this man lives, and "shall live", does not design a natural or corporeal life, and a continuance of that, for such die a natural death, as other men; nor an eternal life, for though they shall so live, yet not by faith; but a spiritual life, a life of justification on Christ, of holiness from him, of communion with him, and of peace and joy; which spiritual life shall be continued, and never be lost. The manner in which the just lives, is "by faith". In the prophet Habakkuk, the words are, "the just shall live"  "by his faith" <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>); which the Septuagint render, "by my faith": and the apostle only reads, "by faith", omitting the affix, as well known, and easy to be supplied: for faith, when given by God, and exercised by the believer, is his own, and by it he lives; not upon it, but by it upon Christ the object of it; from whom, in a way of believing, he derives his spiritual life, and all the comforts of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> faith to faith: <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span><p>(6) The confirmation of the former proposition: we are taught in the gospel that we are instituted before God by faith, which increases daily, and therefore also saved.<p>(z) From faith, which increases daily.<p>(7) The proof of the first as well as of the second proposition, out of Habakkuk, who attributes and gives to faith both justice and life before God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a> illustrates and gives a reason for the foregoing affirmation: <span class="greekheb">δύναμις Θεοῦ ἐστιν εἰς σωτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστ</span>., which could not be the case, unless <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[400]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>] That this does not denote, as in <a href="/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

The passage in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a> is not opposed to this view (as Fritzsche thinks); see <span class="ital">in loc</span>[407]; nor are the expressions <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι ἐνώπιον Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>), and <span class="greekheb">παρὰ Θεῷ</span> (<a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>), for these represent a special form under which the relation is conceived, expressing more precisely the <span class="ital">judicial</span> nature of the matter. Hence it is evident that the interpretation adopted by many modern writers (including Köllner, Fritzsche, Philippi, Umbreit), following Luther: “righteousness <span class="ital">before God</span>,” although correct in point of substance, is unsuitable as regards the analysis of the genitive, which they take as genitive of the <span class="ital">object</span>. This remark applies also against Baur, who (<span class="ital">Paulus</span>, II. p. 146 ff.) takes the genitive <span class="ital">objectively</span> as the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> determined by the idea of God, adequate to that idea; whilst in his <span class="ital">neutest. Theol.</span> p. 134, he prefers to take the genitive <span class="ital">subjectively:</span> the righteousness <span class="ital">produced</span> through God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> “the manner in which God places man in the adequate relation to Himself.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following remarks may serve exegetically to illustrate the <span class="ital">idea</span> of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>, which in the Gospel is revealed from faith:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Since God, as the holy Lawgiver and Judge, has by the law imposed on man the task of keeping it entirely and perfectly (<a href="/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>), He can only receive and treat as a <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> (<span class="ital">who is such, as he should be</span>)—as one normally guiltless and upright, who should be so, therefore, <span class="ital">habitually</span>—the person who keeps the whole law; or, in other words, only the man who is perfectly obedient to the law can stand to God in the relation of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>. Such perfection however no man could attain; not merely no Gentile, since in his case the natural moral law was obscured through immorality, and through disobedience to it he had fallen into sin and vice; but also no Jew, for natural desire, excited by the principle of sin in him through the very fact of legal prohibition, hindered in his case the fulfilment of the divine law, and rendered him also, without exception, morally weak, a sinner and object of the divine wrath. If therefore man was to enter into the relation of a righteous person and thereby of a future participator in the Messianic blessedness, it was necessary that this should be done by means of an extraordinary divine arrangement, through which grace and reconciliation should be imparted to the object of wrath, and he should be put forward for the judgment of God as righteous. This arrangement has been effected through the sending of His Son and His being given up to His bloody death as that of a guiltless sacrifice; whereby God’s counsel of redemption, formed from eternity, has been accomplished,—objectively for all, subjectively to be appropriated on the part of individuals through faith, which is the <span class="greekheb">ὄργανον ληπτικόν</span>. And, as this plan of salvation is the subject-matter of the <span class="ital">Gospel</span>, so in this <span class="ital">Gospel</span> that which previously, though prefigured by the justification of Abraham, was an unrevealed <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>, namely, <span class="ital">righteousness from God</span>, is revealed (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτεται</span>), inasmuch as the Gospel makes known both the accomplished work of redemption itself and the means whereby man appropriates the redemption, namely, <span class="ital">faith in Christ</span>, which, <span class="ital">imputed</span> to him as righteousness (<a href="/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>), causes man to be regarded and treated by God out of grace and <span class="greekheb">δωρεάν</span> (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>) as righteous (<span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>), so that he, like one who has perfectly obeyed the law, is certain of the Messianic bliss destined for the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοί</span>.[408] The so-called obedientia Christi <span class="ital">activa</span> is not to be included in the <span class="ital">causa meritoria</span> of the divine justification; but is to be regarded as the fulfilment of a <span class="ital">preliminary condition</span> necessary to the death of Jesus, so far as the justification of man was objectively based on the latter; without the complete <span class="ital">active</span> obedience of Christ (consequently without His sinlessness) His <span class="ital">passive</span> obedience could not have been that <span class="ital">causa meritoria</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτεται</span>] <span class="ital">is revealed;</span> for previously, and in the absence of the Gospel, the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span> was and is something quite hidden in the counsel of God, the knowledge of which is first given <span class="ital">in the Gospel</span> (comp <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>).

Inasmuch, namely, as righteousness is revealed in the Gospel <span class="ital">from</span> faith, faith is <span class="ital">aimed at, i.e.</span> the revelation spoken of proceeds from faith and is <span class="ital">designed to produce faith</span>. This sense, equivalent to “<span class="ital">ut fides habeatur</span>,” and rightly corresponding alike with the simple words and the context, is adopted by Heumann, Fritzsche, Tholuck, Krehl, Nielsen, and van Hengel. It is not “too meaningless” (de Wette), nor “saying pretty nearly nothing” (Philippi); but is on the contrary emphatically appropriate to the purpose of representing faith as the <span class="ital">Fac totum</span> (“prora et puppis,” Bengel, Comp Baur, II. p. 161).

Quite arbitrary, moreover, was the interpretation: “<span class="ital">ex fide legis in fidem evangelii</span>” (Tertullian; Comp Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">δεῖ γὰρ πιστεῦσαι τοῖς προφήταις</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ διʼ ἐκείνων εἰς τὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου πίστιν ποδηγηθῆναι</span>, Zeger, and others). Finally, to take <span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span> as <span class="ital">faithfulness</span>, and to understand <span class="greekheb">πίστις εἰς πίστιν</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">faith in the faithfulness of God</span> (Mehring), is to introduce what is neither in the words nor yet suggested by the context. Ewald in his <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> IX. p. 87 ff., interprets: <span class="ital">faith in faith</span>, the reference being to the faith with which man meets the <span class="ital">divine</span> faith in his power and his good will (?). But the idea of “faith from beneath on the faith from above,” as well as the notion generally of God <span class="ital">believing</span> on men, would be a paradox in the N. T., which no reader could have discovered without more clear and precise indication. After <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστ</span>. every one could not but understand <span class="greekheb">εἰς πίστ</span>. also as meaning <span class="ital">human</span> faith; and indeed everywhere it is man that believes, not <span class="ital">God</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθὼς γέγραπται</span>] represents what has just been stated, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>.… <span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span>, as taking place <span class="ital">in accordance with a declaration of Scripture</span>, consequently according to the necessity of the divine counsel of salvation. <span class="ital">He who from faith</span> (on Christ) <span class="ital">is righteous</span> (transferred into the relation of the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>) <span class="ital">shall live</span> (be partaker of the Messianic eternal life). This, as the Messianic sense intended to be conveyed by the Spirit of God (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a>) in the prophetic words, <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, “<span class="ital">the righteous shall by his faithfulnessl</span>[418] <span class="ital">live</span>” (attain the theocratic life-blessedness), is recognised by Paul, and expressed substantially in the language of the LXX., rightly omitting the <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, which they inaccurately add to <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>. In doing so Paul <span class="ital">might</span>, in accordance with the Messianic reference of the passage, connect <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ ΠΊΣΤΕΩς</span></span></span> (<span class="greekheb">בֶאֱמוּנָתוֹ</span>)—seeing that on this causal definition the <span class="ital">stress</span> of the expression lies—with <span class="greekheb">ὁ δίκαιος</span>; because, if the <span class="ital">life</span> of the righteous has <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς</span></span></span> as its cause, his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> itself can have no other ground or source. That he has <span class="ital">really</span> so connected the words, as Beza and others rightly perceived (see especially Hölemann, <span class="ital">de justitiae ex fide ambab. in V. T. sedibus</span>, Lips. 1867), and not, as most earlier expositors have supposed (also de Wette, Tholuck, Delitzsch, on Hab. <span class="ital">l.c</span>[419], Philippi, Baumgarten-Crusius, van Hengel, Ewald, and Hofmann), <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζήσεται</span>, is plain from the connection, according to which it is not the <span class="ital">life</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστ</span>., but <span class="ital">the revelation of righteousness</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστ</span>. that is to be confirmed by the Old Testament. The case is different in <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>. See further, generally, on <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is, without having any bearing on the matter, adopted along with the other words from the LXX.

(<a href="/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>). As regards Pauline usage, it is plain that Romans 3 is the <span class="ital">locus criticus</span> for its leading meaning, which meaning we may expect to find here. <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a> appears to supply the key to this meaning: the “righteousness of God” is something which is reached, or received, “through faith in Jesus Christ;” and it is “declared” in such a way as to shew Him “just, <span class="ital">yet justifying</span>.” On the whole it is most consistent with most passages to explain it of the “righteousness imputed by God” to the believer. (See esp. cch. 3 and 4 for explanations of <span class="ital">imputation</span>.) It is “<span class="ital">God’s</span> righteousness,” as being provided by Him and availing with Him. (“Die Gerechtigkeit <span class="ital">die vor Gott gilt</span>,” “the righteousness <span class="ital">which avails with God</span>,” is Luther’s paraphrase.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is objected that the word rendered “righteousness” denotes a <span class="ital">real moral state</span>. But this is only partially true. It quite as much tends to denote what makes a man clear <span class="ital">in the eye of the law, satisfactory to justice;</span> and just such is the effect, according to this Epistle, of the Work of Christ accepted by faith. With proper caution we may thus say that “righteousness,” in this and similar phrases, is often a <span class="ital">practical</span> equivalent for “Justification.”—In <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm" title="But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.">Matthew 6:33</a> the reference at least <span class="ital">may</span> be as above; in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a> we have another but cognate reference, viz. to the <span class="ital">aspect of the justified</span> before God; in <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a> and <a href="/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">James 1:20</a>, the meaning seems to be quite different, though equally proper to the Greek words, viz. “the will of the righteous God.” For variations in this Epistle see notes on successive passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">revealed from faith to faith</span>] Q. d. “is unfolded, and displays faith, and only faith, as its secret, at each disclosure.” (1) The initial step, the <span class="ital">entrance</span> to justification, is faith: (2) The <span class="ital">life</span> of the justified is <span class="ital">maintained</span> by faith: faith is the starting-point and the course.—“<span class="ital">Is revealed:</span>”—a present tense in the Gr.:—<span class="bld">is revealing</span>. The idea is of a perpetually recurring process: “to each fresh discoverer it is revealed.” So of the <span class="ital">opposite</span> “revelation,” <a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as it is written</span>] The formula of quotation, sanctioned by the Saviour Himself in His own all-significant use of Scripture at the Temptation. “It is written; it is written again.” (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.">Matthew 4:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-7.htm" title="Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.">Matthew 4:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.">Matthew 4:10</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the first direct quotation in this Epistle.

Such humility of trust marks the “just” man, the man <span class="ital">right in God’s sight;</span> and thereby he stands possessed of “life,” i.e., peace and security before God. This brief but profound sentence is here taken by the Apostle as the text of his great statement of Justification. So again in <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>.—“<span class="ital">By faith:</span>”—lit. <span class="bld">out of faith;</span> i.e. in consequence of it, after it, as the <span class="ital">condition</span> on which “life” is given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δικαιοσὑνη</span> Θεο͂<span class="greekheb">υ</span>, <span class="ital">the righteousness of God</span>) <span class="ital">The righteousness of God</span> is frequently mentioned in the New Testament, often in the books of Isaiah and Daniel, most often in the Psalms.

(I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a>; and also that righteousness, as it is termed in the case of [when applied to] men, either particular or universal, in which grace, and mercy also, are included, and which is shown principally in the condemnation of sin, and in the justification of the sinner; and thus, in this view, the essential <span class="ital">righteousness of God</span> is evidently not to be excluded from the business of justification, ch. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>, etc. Hence it sometimes signifies this latter <span class="ital">righteousness</span>, by which a man (in consequence of the gift <span class="ital">of God</span>, <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm" title="But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.">Matthew 6:33</a>) becomes righteous, and is righteous; and that, too, either by laying hold of the righteousness of Jesus Christ through faith, ch. <a href="/context/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;...">Romans 3:21-22</a>, or by imitating that [the former spoken of] righteousness of God, in the practice of virtue, and in the performance of good works, <a href="/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a>. That righteousness of faith is called <span class="ital">the righteousness of God</span> by Paul, when he is speaking of justification; because God has originated and prepared it, reveals and bestows it, approves and crowns it with completion (comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a>), to which, therefore, men’s <span class="ital">own</span> righteousness is opposed, <a href="/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>; with which comp. <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>.

The <span class="ital">showing forth</span> [‘<span class="ital">declare</span>.’—Engl. vers.] of the righteousness of God was made in the death of Christ, ch. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>, etc. [<span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξιν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνης</span>]; the manifestation and revelation of that righteousness of God, which is through faith, are made in the Gospel: ch. <a href="/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>, and in this passage. Thus there is here a double <span class="ital">revelation</span> made; (comp. <a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a> with this verse) namely, of wrath and of righteousness. The former by the law, which is but little known to nature; the latter, by the Gospel, which is altogether unknown to nature. The former precedes and prepares the way; the latter follows after. Each is <span class="ital">a matter of revelation</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτεται</span>), the word being expressed in the present tense, in opposition to the times of ignorance, <a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν</span>, <span class="ital">from faith to faith</span>) Construe the <span class="ital">righteousness which is of</span> or <span class="ital">from faith</span>, as we have presently after <span class="ital">the just from faith</span> [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> he who is justified,—whose righteousness is, of faith].

It is to avoid what might be disagreeable to his readers, that Paul does not yet expressly exclude works, of which, however, in this Statement of Subject [Proposition], an exclusion of some kind should otherwise have appeared. Furthermore, the nature of a proposition, thus set forth, bears, that many other things may be inferred from this; for inasmuch as it is not said, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς πίστεως εἰς τὴν πίστιν</span>, from the faith to the faith, but indefinitely <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν</span> from faith to faith, so we shall say [we may say by inference] from one faith to another, from the faith of God, who makes the offer, to the faith of men, who receive it, ch. <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>, etc.; from the faith of the Old Testament, and of the Jews, to the faith of the New Testament, and of the Gentiles also, ch. <a href="/romans/3-30.htm" title="Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.">Romans 3:30</a>; from the faith of Paul to the faith of the Romans, ch. <a href="/romans/1-12.htm" title="That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.">Romans 1:12</a>; from one degree of faith to still higher degrees, <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>; from the faith of the strong to the faith of the weak, ch. <a href="/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>, etc.; from our faith, which is that of expectation, to the faith, which is to be divinely made good to us, by the gift of life [“The just shall live by faith”].—<span class="greekheb">καθως</span>, as) Paul has just laid down three principles: I.

It is to be observed that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> is the preposition before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> in both clauses of the sentence, though our Authorized Version makes a difference. Further, we render, with the Authorized Version, "<span class="accented">the</span> righteousness of God," rather than "<span class="accented">a</span> righteousness," as in the Revised Version, notwithstanding the absence of the article. For what is meant is the definite conception, pervading the Epistle, of <span class="accented">God's righteousness.</span> If there were room for doubt, it would surely be removed by <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, also without the article, immediately following, and with the same verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Revisers, translating here "tins wrath," have given in the margin as tenable "a <span class="accented">wrath</span>," apparently for the sake of consistency with their rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. But "<span class="accented">a</span> wrath of God" has no intelligible meaning. The expressions seem simply to mean <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span> and <span class="accented">God's wrath.</span> This expression, "the righteousness of God," has been discussed in the Introduction, to which the reader is referred. Its intrinsic meaning is there taken to be God's own eternal righteousness, revealed in Christ for reconciling the world to himself, rather than (as commonly interpreted) the <span class="accented">forensic</span> righteousness (so called) imputed to man. Thus there is no need to understand the genitive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as <span class="accented">gen. auctoris</span>, or as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The phrase is understood in the sense that would be familiar to St. Paul and his readers from the Old Testament; and it is conceived that this intrinsic sense pervades the whole Epistle even when a righteousness imputed to <span class="accented">man</span> is spoken of; the idea still being that of the Divine righteousness embracing man. It is not clear in what exact sense <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to be understood. Most commentators, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> to denote man's imputed righteousness, connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with it, as if <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> had been written (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>). But the absence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span>, as well as the collocation of words, seems rather to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be meant to express the subjective condition for man's apprehension, and appropriation, of God's righteousness. The revelation of it to man's own soul is said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> while <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the result; viz. faith unto salvation. A like use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. In the last of these passages <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, has a close resemblance to the expression before us. The quotation from <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> seems mainly meant to illustrate what has been said concerning <span class="accented">faith</span>, though the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in it in connection with faith, may have also suggested it as apposite, as is evidently the case in <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, where St. Paul quotes it in proof of the position that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>. The prophet had in immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time, and had cried, "LORD, how long?" But he had stood upon his watch to look out for what the LORD would say unto him; and an answer had come to him to the effect that, in spite of appearances, his prophetic vision would ere long be realized, God's promises to the faithful would certainly be fulfilled, and that <span class="accented">faith</span> meanwhile must be their sustaining principle - "The just shall live by his faith." So in the Hebrew. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (A.), or <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (B). The variations do not affect the general sense of the passage. Now some, supposing St. Paul to connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as part of the subject of the sentence, would accuse him of giving the quotation a meaning not intended by the prophet, who evidently meant <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> to go with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as part of the predicate. But there is no reason for attributing this intention to St. Paul, except on the supposition that he had previously connected <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. But we have seen reason for concluding that this was not so. The quotation, in the sense intended by the prophet, is sufficiently apposite. For it expresses that <span class="accented">faith</span> is the life-principle of God's righteous ones, while the whole passage at the end of which it occurs declares the salvation of prophetic vision to be entirely of God, to be waited for and apprehended by man through faith, not brought about by his own doings. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;).<p>Rev., more correctly, therein is revealed a righteousness of God. The absence of the article denotes that a peculiar kind of righteousness is meant. This statement contains the subject of the epistle: Righteousness is by faith. The subject is not stated formally nor independently, but as a proof that the Gospel is a power, etc.<p>This word &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; righteousness, and its kindred words &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; righteous, and &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9; to make righteous, play so important a part in this epistle that it is desirable to fix their meaning as accurately as possible.<p>Classical Usage. In the Greek classics there appears an eternal, divine, unwritten principle of right, dwelling in the human consciousness, shaping both the physical and the moral ordering of the world, and personified as Themis (&#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;). This word is used as a common noun in the phrase &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; it is right (fundamentally and eternally), like the Latin fas est. Thus Homer, of Penelope mourning for Ulysses, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; it is the sacred obligation of the wife (founded in her natural relation to her husband, ordained of heaven) to mourn ("Odyssey," 14, 130). So Antigone appeals to the unwritten law against the barbarity of refusing burial to her brother.<p>"Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,<p>That thou, a mortal man, shouldst overpass<p>The unwritten laws of God that know not change."<p>Sophocles, "Antigone," 453-455.<p>See, also, "Odyssey," 14, 91; Aristophanes, "Clouds," 140; "Antigone," 880.<p>This divine ordering requires that men should be shown or pointed to that which is according to it - a definite circle of duties and obligations which constitute right (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). Thus what is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; righteous, is properly the expression of the eternal Themis. While &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; and &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; are not to be distinguished as human and divine, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; has a more distinctively human, personal character, and comes into sharper definition. It introduces the distinction between absolute right and power. It imposes the recognition of a moral principle over against an absolutely constraining natural force. The conception of &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; is strongly moral. &#x394;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is right; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; is rightness as characterizing the entire being of man.<p>There is a religious background to the pagan conception. In the Homeric poems morality stands in a relation, loose and undeveloped indeed, but none the less real, to religion. This appears in the use of the oath in compacts; in the fear of the wrath of heaven for omission of sacrifices; in regarding refusal of hospitality as an offense against Zeus, the patron of strangers and suppliants. Certain tribes which are fierce and uncivilized are nevertheless described as &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; righteous. "The characteristic stand-point of the Homeric ethics is that the spheres of law, of morals, and of religion are by no means separate, but lie side by side in undeveloped unity." (Nagelsbach).<p>In later Greek literature this conception advances, in some instances, far toward the christian ideal; as in the fourth book of Plato's "Laws," where he asserts that God holds in His hand the beginning, middle, and end of all things; that justice always follows Him, and punishes those who fall short of His laws. Those who would be dear to God must be like Him. Without holiness no man is accepted of God.<p>Nevertheless, however clearly the religious background and sanction of morality may be recognized, it is apparent that the basis of right is found, very largely, in established social usage. The word ethics points first to what is established by custom. While with Mr. Grote we must admit the peculiar emphasis on the individual in the Homeric poems, we cannot help observing a certain influence of social sentiment on morals. While there are cases like the suitors, Paris and Helen, where public opinion imposes no moral check, there are others where the force of public opinion is clearly visible, such as Penelope and Nausicaa. The Homeric view of homicide reveals no relation between moral sentiment and divine enactment. Murder is a breach of social law, a private and civil wrong, entailing no loss of character. Its penalty is a satisfaction to the feelings of friends, or a compensation for lost services.<p>Later, we find this social aspect of morality even more strongly emphasized. "The city becomes the central and paramount source of obligation. The great, impersonal authority called 'the Laws' stands out separately, both as guide and sanction, distinct from religious duty or private sympathy" (Grote). Socrates is charged with impiety because he does not believe in the gods of the state, and Socrates himself agrees that that man does right who obeys what the citizens have agreed should be done, and who refrains from what they forbid.<p>continued...</body></html>
