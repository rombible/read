The phrase “into a lie,” is literally, <span class= "ital">with a lie,</span> the “lie” being regarded as the instrument by which the substitution is made. By “a lie” is meant here “false gods,” who are the supreme embodiment of falsehood. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-25.htm" title="This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, said the LORD; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.">Jeremiah 13:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm" title="O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.">Jeremiah 16:19</a>, &c.)<p>The introduction of the doxology in this verse is due to an impulse of reverential feeling. Shocked at the language which he finds himself using, and at the connection in which the most Holy Name has been mentioned, the Apostle turns aside for a moment to testify to his own humble adoration.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who changed the truth of God - This is a repetition of the declaration in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>, in another form. The phrase, "the truth of God" is a Hebrew phrase, meaning "the true God." In such a case, where two nouns come together, one is employed as an adjective to qualify the other. Most commonly the latter of two nouns is used as the adjective, but sometimes it is the former, as in this case. God is called "the true God" in opposition to idols, which are called false gods. There is but one real or true God, and all others are false.<p>Into a lie - Into idols, or false gods. Idols are not infrequently called falsehood and lies, because they are not true representations of God; <a href="/jeremiah/13-25.htm">Jeremiah 13:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>.<p>The creature - Created things, as the sun, moon, animals, etc.<p>Who is blessed forever - It was not uncommon to add a doxology, or ascription of praise to God, when his name was mentioned; see <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>. The Jews also usually did it. In this way they preserved veneration for the name of God, and accustomed themselves to speak of him with reverence. "The Muslims also borrowed this custom from the Jews, and practice it to a great extent. Tholuck mentions an Arabic manuscript in the library at Berlin which contains an account of heresies in respect to Islamism, and as often as the writer has occasion to mention the name of a new heretical sect, he adds, 'God be exalted above all which they say'" (Stuart).<p>Amen - This is a Hebrew word denoting strong affirmation. So let it be. It implies here the solemn assent of the writer to what was just said; or his strong wish that what he had said might be - that the name of God might be esteemed and be blessed forever. The mention of the degrading idolatry of the pagans was strongly calculated to impress on his mind the superior excellency and glory of the one living God. It is mentioned respecting the honorable Robert Boyle, that he never mentioned the name of God without a solemn pause, denoting his profound reverence. Such a practice would tend eminently to prevent an unholy familiarity and irreverence in regard to the sacred name of the Most High; compare <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

The second case is that which occurs here, in accordance both with the nature of the case, seeing that the Gentiles did not worship the Creator at all, and with the immediate connection (<span class="greekheb">μετήλλαξαν</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ψεύδει</span>). The sense therefore substantially amounts to <span class="ital">praeterito creatore</span> (Hilary), or <span class="ital">relicto creatore</span> (Cyprian), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> they honoured the creature and <span class="ital">not</span> the Creator, whom they ought to have honoured.

So in substance also Beza, Estius, and others, including Reiche, Tholuck, Olshausen, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Krehl, Reithmayr, Maier, Philippi, van Hengel. The <span class="ital">relative</span> interpretation: <span class="ital">more than the Creator</span> (Vulgate, Erasmus, Luther, Castalio, Grotius, Ammon, Rückert, and others), is therefore in point of fact erroneous. The <span class="ital">contra creatorem</span>, which Hammond, Koppe, Flatt, Fritzsche and Mehring find here, may likewise be traced to the sense of comparison (see Bernhardy, p. 259; Winer, p. 377 [E. T. 504]; and the passages from Plato in Ast. <span class="ital">Lex.</span> III. p. 28), but has against it the fact, that in the whole context Paul presents the matter in the light of a <span class="greekheb">μετάλλαξις</span>, of an <span class="ital">exchanging</span> the true for the false, not of <span class="ital">hostility</span> to the true. From that point of view the Gentiles have worshipped the creature, and not the Creator.
