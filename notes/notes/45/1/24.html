He left them to follow their own evil bent. Their idolatry developed into shameless immorality and unnatural crimes. At last the extreme limit was reached. As they voluntarily forsook God, so He forsook them. They ran through the whole catalogue of sins, and the cup of their iniquity was full.<p>In the passage taken as a whole, three steps or stages are indicated: (1) <a href="/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18-23</a>, idolatry; (2) <a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24-27</a>, unnatural sins allowed by God as the punishment for this idolatry; (3) <a href="/context/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28-32</a>, a still more complete and radical depravity also regarded as penally inflicted. The first step is taken by the free choice of man, but as the breach gradually widens, the wrath of God is more and more revealed. He interferes less and less to save a sinful world from its fate. It is to be noted that the Apostle speaks in general terms, and the precise proportions of human depravity and of divine judicial impulse are not to be clearly determined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:...">Romans 1:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore God gave them up — </span>As a punishment of this most unreasonable and scandalous idolatry, God withdrew his restraining grace from them as he did from the antediluvians, <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>; the consequence of which was, that their lusts excited them to commit every sort of uncleanness.

For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - That is, because they were unwilling to retain him in their knowledge, and chose to worship idols.

For this reason the view of Köllner—that the Apostle’s idea is to be separated from its Jewish and temporal form, and that we must assume as the Christian truth in it, that the apostasy of men from God has brought them into deepest misery, as certainly as the latter is self-inflicted—is a superfluous unexegetical evasion, to which Fritzsche also has recourse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσίαν</span>] <span class="ital">spurcitia</span>, <span class="ital">impurity</span>, and that <span class="ital">lustful</span> (comp <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>), as is plain from the following context; not generally: “all action and conduct dishonouring the creaturely glory of man” (Hofmann). The <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀτιμάζεσθαι</span> may be taken either as the genitive of the purpose: <span class="ital">that</span> they might be dishonoured (Rückert, Philippi, van Hengel), or as the genitive of more precise definition depending on <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσ</span>. (impurity of <span class="ital">the becoming dishonoured, i.e.</span> which <span class="ital">consisted therein</span>; so Fritzsche, Winer, Tholuck and de Wette). The latter (see Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

This <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</span> refers to the persons (<span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, not to be written <span class="greekheb">αὑτῶν</span>), not asserting that the <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμάζασθαι</span> takes place <span class="ital">on themselves</span>, which is in fact already conveyed by <span class="greekheb">τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν</span>,[494] but rather based on the nature of participation in unchastity, according to which they bring <span class="ital">one on the other reciprocally</span> the dishonouring of the body. In this personal reciprocity of those who practise unchastity with each other lies the characteristic abominableness of the dishonouring of the body; and this point is designated by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</span> more expressly, because in contrast to non-participating third persons, than it would have been by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀλλήλοις</span> (Kühner, <span class="ital">a</span>[495]<span class="ital"> Xen.

As they again prevail even among Christians, wherever this apostasy spreads through unbelief, they must verify even in Christendom their <span class="ital">heathen</span> nature, and, along with the likewise essentially heathen <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>, pre-eminently exclude from the salvation of the Messiah (<a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a> f.; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Theodoret explains it: <span class="greekheb">τῆς οἰκείας προμηθείας ἐγύμνωσε</span>, and employs the comparison of an abandoned vessel. Theophylact illustrates the <span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν</span> by the example of a physician who gives up a refractory patient (<span class="greekheb">παραδίδωσιν αὐτὸν τῷ ἐπὶ πλέον νοσεῖν</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[490] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[492] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[493] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[494] Hofmann refers the reading which he follows, <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>, to the <span class="greekheb">σώματα</span>, but explains this: the body of each person <span class="ital">in himself;</span> consequently, as if the expression were <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>, and that in the sense <span class="ital">in semet ipsis</span>.

Nothing but the knowledge of the Holy One, Eternal and Almighty, can ever really teach and enforce human purity; even though conscience (up to its light) always takes the part of purity. Manifold experience shews that mere social civilization and mental culture can never really banish even the grossest lusts.

The verb, however, is probably passive, a middle use of it not being elsewhere found. In either ease the general meaning is the same.

It is notorious that idolatrous worship was not uncommonly accompanied by debauchery; notably that of the Phoenician Astarte, and of Aphrodite and Dionysus (see Livy, 39:8, for an account of the Dionysus at one time in Rome; and Athen., 13. pp. 574, 579, and 14. p. 659, for the Aphrodisia at Athens and Corinth); cf. <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, etc., "The people joined themselves unto Baal-peor," and the allusion to it, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>. On that occasion no more is intimated than promiscuous intercourse between the two sexes, sinking men in that regard to the level of the brutes; but still worse "uncleanness" is in the apostle's view, such as sinks them even below that level; and how common such unnatural vices had become, and how lightly thought of, no one conversant with classical literature needs to be reminded. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Gave them up (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Handed them over to the power of sin.
