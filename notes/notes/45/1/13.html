As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us.

Such services are our duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That oftentimes I purposed - See <a href="/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>. How often he had purposed this we have no means of ascertaining. The fact, however, that he had done it, showed his strong desire to see them, and to witness the displays of the grace of God in the capital of the Roman world; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23-24</a>. One instance of his having purposed to go to Rome is recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>, "After these things were ended (namely, at Ephesus), Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem; saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome." This purpose expressed in this manner in the Epistle, and the Acts of the Apostles, has been shown by Dr. Paley (Horae Paulinae on <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>) to be one of those undesigned coincidences which strongly show that both books are genuine; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23-24</a>, with <a href="/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>. A forger of these books would not have thought of such a contrivance as to feign such a purpose to go to Rome at that time, and to have mentioned it in that manner. Such coincidences are among the best proofs that can be demanded, that the writers did not intend to impose on the world; see Paley.<p>But was let hitherto - The word "let" means to "hinder," or to "obstruct." In what way this was done we do not know, but it is probable that he refers to the various openings for the preaching of the gospel where he had been, and to the obstructions of various kinds from the enemies of the gospel to the fulfillment of his purposes.<p>That I might have some fruit among you - That I might be the means of the conversion of sinners and of the edification of the church in the capital of the Roman Empire. It was not curiosity to see the splendid capital of the world that prompted this desire; it was not the love of travel, and of roaming from clime to clime; it was the specific purpose of doing good to the souls of human beings. To "have fruit" means to obtain success in bringing men to the knowledge of Christ. Thus, the Saviour said <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>," I have chosen you, and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, but was let&#8212;hindered.<p>hitherto&#8212;chiefly by his desire to go first to places where Christ was not known (Ro 15:20-24).<p>that I might have some fruit&#8212;of my ministry<p>among you also, even as among other Gentiles&#8212;The Gentile origin of the Church at Rome is here so explicitly stated, that those who conclude, merely from the Jewish strain of the argument, that they must have been mostly Israelites, decide in opposition to the apostle himself.

The apostle calls them brethren, because many of them were Jews, his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh, and all of them were his brethren in a spiritual relation; and this he does to express his affection to them, and engage their attention and credit to him, and particularly to this matter which he now acquaints them with, being unwilling they should be ignorant of it; <p>that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you: it was not a sudden start of mind, or a desire that lately arose up in him, but a settled resolution and determination, and which he had often made: <p>but was let hitherto; either by God, who had work for him to do in other places; or by Satan, who sometimes by divine permission has had such power and influence; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, or through the urgent necessities of other churches, which required his stay with them longer than he intended: his end in taking up at several times such a resolution of coming to them was, says he, <p>that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles: by fruit he means, not any reward of his labour, either temporal or eternal; but the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, and the fruitfulness of believers in grace and works. The apostle seems to allude to the casting of seed into the earth: Christ's ministers' are husbandmen, who sow the seed of the word, which lies some time under the clods; wherefore patience is necessary to wait its springing up, first in the blade, and then in the ear, then in the full corn in the ear, when it brings forth fruit; all which depend on the blessing of God: and when he adds, "as among other Gentiles", his design is not so much to let them know that they were as other Gentiles, upon a level with them, had no pre-eminence as citizens of Rome, over other saints, being all one in Christ Jesus; as to observe to them his success in other places, where he had been preaching the Gospel of the grace of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>.

The correction came often in the form, not of silent providence, but of miraculous intimation. See <a href="/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,...">Acts 16:6-7</a>, and cp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;...">2 Corinthians 1:15-17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but was let hitherto</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">and was let (hindered)</span>.

It is profitable, in this place, to consider the titles, which the apostles use in their addresses. They rather seldom introduce proper names, such as <span class="ital">Corinthians, Timothy</span>, etc. Paul most frequently calls them <span class="ital">brethren;</span> sometimes, when he is exhorting them, <span class="ital">beloved</span>, or <span class="ital">my beloved brethren</span>. James says, <span class="ital">brethren, my brethren, my beloved brethren;</span> Peter and Jude always use the word <span class="ital">beloved;</span> John often, <span class="ital">beloved;</span> once, <span class="ital">brethren;</span> more than once, <span class="ital">little</span>, or <span class="ital">my little children</span>, as Paul, <span class="ital">my son Timothy</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καρπὸν σχῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I might have fruit</span>) <span class="ital">Have</span>, a word elegantly placed midway between <span class="ital">receive</span> and <span class="ital">give</span>. What is profitable to others is a delight to Paul himself. He esteems that as the <span class="ital">fruit</span> [<span class="ital">of his labour</span>] (<a href="/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>). In every place, he wishes to have something [a gift] put out at interest. He somewhat modifies [qualifies] this desire of gain [spiritual gain], when he speaks of himself in the following verse as a <span class="ital">debtor</span>. He both <span class="ital">demands</span> and <span class="ital">owes</span>, <a href="/romans/1-12.htm" title="That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.">Romans 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>.

Some take the "but" at the beginning of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) as the apodosis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8, with the meaning, "I am aware, and am thankful, that your faith is already notorious; <span class="accented">but</span> still I wish you to know that I have long had a desire to visit you." But the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> are too far separated to commend this view. It is more after St. Paul's style that there should be no apodosis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>; his train of thought carries him on so that he forgets how he began his sentence; and ver. 13 comes naturally as the sequence of ver. 12, whether we render <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "but," or (as in the Authorized Version) by "now," or (as in the Revised Version) by "and." The long-cherished intention here spoken of had been expressed by him when at Ephesus, before his departure to Macedonia (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>). Feeling himself to be peculiarly the apostle to the Gentile world, and having already been the first agent in carrying the gospel into Europe (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>), and having established it there in important centres of population, he ever kept in view an eventual visit to the imperial city itself, in the hope of its thence permeating the whole western world. What had so far hindered him appears from <a href="/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> to have been principally missionary work which had first to be accomplished elsewhere. At last Providence carried him there in a way not of his own choosing. Thus man proposes, God disposes. In this verse the Roman Church seems certainly to be regarded as a Gentile one. What classes of converts probably at that time composed it has been considered in the Introduction. Whatever its nucleus, St. Paul plainly feels that, in sending this Epistle to it, he is carrying out his especial mission of extending the gospel to the Gentile world, though at the same time he writes mainly from a Jewish standpoint, appealing frequently to the Jewish Scriptures, with which he presupposes an acquaintance on the part of his readers. But the latter fact is not inconsistent with the supposition of their being, either then or prospectively, mainly of Gentile race. The gospel was everywhere preached as the fulfilment of Judaism (see note on ver. 2); and for understanding both its purport and its evidences, all would have to be to some extent indoctrinated in the ancient Scriptures. It is to be observed, too, that in the next verse the apostle implies a sense of now addressing a peculiarly civilized and cultivated community; he seems to have before him the prospect of his address reaching the educated and intelligent classes of society in the imperial city. And the Epistle, as it goes on, is in accordance with such an aim. For its arguments are addressed, not merely to believers in the Old Testament, but also generally to philosophical thinkers. The state of the world is reviewed, human consciousness is analyzed, deep problems which had long exercised the minds of philosophers are touched on, and the gospel is, in fact, commended to the world as God's answer to man's needs. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I would not have you ignorant<p>An emphatic expression calling special attention to what follows.
