The apostle’s assertion is confirmed by the writings of the Greek and Latin philosophers still remaining.

Thus Dr. Whitby understands the expression, observing, “It seems not to signify the means by which they came to the knowledge of God, for these are afterward expressed, but rather to import, that from the beginning of the world the heathen had the means of knowing the true God from the works of creation; so <span class="greekheb">απ αρχης κοσμου </span>is, <span class="ital">from the beginning of the world, </span><a href="/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.">Matthew 24:21</a>; and <span class="greekheb">απο καταβολης κοσμου </span><span class="ital">from the foundation of the world, </span><a href="/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>.” <span class="ital">Are clearly seen </span>— By the eye of the mind, <span class="ital">being understood </span>— They are seen by them, and them only, who use their understanding.

But they who have obtained a partial knowledge of what is called natural philosophy, have, from the discovery of some second causes, been led to fancy, that the whole system may be accounted for without the intervention of a Deity. This is what the apostle calls, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>, <span class="ital">becoming vain in their imaginations, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">foolish in their reasonings. </span>Those, however, who have made the greatest advances in true philosophy know, that second causes, properly speaking, are no causes, because they have no efficiency in themselves, but are set in motion by God. And thus the most perfect philosophy always ends where the natural sense of mankind begins.” <span class="ital">Even his eternal power and Godhead — </span>“The true God, being eternal, is thereby distinguished from the fictitious gods of the heathens, who all had a beginning; the most ancient of them being represented as coming out of chaos, and their birth being sung by the heathen poets. Of the particular attributes of God, the apostle mentions only his <span class="ital">power, </span>because the effects of the divine power are what first strike the senses of men, and lead them most directly to the acknowledgment of a Deity. The word <span class="greekheb">Θειοτης</span>, <span class="ital">Godhead, </span>denotes every thing comprehended in the idea of God, namely, his unity, incorporeity, immutability, knowledge, wisdom, justice, &c.; all which, together with God’s eternal power, the apostle affirms every intelligent person may understand, by the things which are made.” Macknight. <span class="ital">So that they are without excuse </span>— And would be destitute of every just or plausible apology for themselves, if he should enter into judgment with them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because - The apostle proceeds to show how it was that the pagan hindered the truth by their iniquity. This he does by showing that the truth might be known by the works of creation; and that nothing but their iniquity prevented it.<p>That which may be known of God - That which is "knowable" concerning God. The expression implies that there may be many things concerning God which cannot be known. But there are also many things which may be ascertained. Such are his existence, and many of his attributes, his power, and wisdom, and justice, etc. The object of the apostle was not to say that every thing pertaining to God could be known by them, or that they could have as clear a view of him as if they had possessed a revelation. We must interpret the expression according to the object which he had in view. That was to show that so much might be known of God as to prove that they had no excuse for their crimes; or that God would be just in punishing them for their deeds. For this, it was needful only that his existence and his justice, or his determination to punish sin, should be known; and this, the apostle affirms, was known among them, and had been from the creation of the world. This expression. therefore, is not to be pressed as implying that they knew all that could be known about God, or that they knew as much as they who had a revelation; but that they knew enough to prove that they had no excuse for their sins.<p>Is manifest - Is known; is understood.<p>In them - "Among" them. So the preposition "in" is often used. It means that they had this knowledge; or it had been communicated to them. The great mass of the pagan world was indeed ignorant of the true God; but their leaders, or their philosophers, had this knowledge; see the note at <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>. But this was not true of the mass, or body of the people. Still it was true that this knowledge was in the possession of man, or was "among" the pagan world. and would have spread, had it not been for the love of sin.<p>God hath showed it to them - Compare <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. He had endowed them with reason and conscience <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14-15</a>; he had made them capable of seeing and investigating his works; he had spread before them the proofs of his wisdom, and goodness, and power, and had thus given them the means of learning his perfections and will. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

The apostle, by a prolepis, prevents an objection which some might make in excuse of the Gentiles: how could they sufficate or suppress the truth, seeing they wanted the Scripture, and were without the knowledge of it? To this he answers, that they were not wholly without knowledge, for that which might be known of God was manifest in them, and revealed to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is manifest in them, </span> i.e. in their heart and minds; see <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a></span>: or, to and among them; as appears by many of their learned writers, who have left behind them many clear discourses, and wise essays and sayings, about this matter, though they themselves did act contrary thereunto. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For God hath showed it unto them; </span> i.e. as before, by the light of nature in their consciences, or by the consideration of the creatures, as it follows in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because that which may be known of God,.... There are some things which could not be known of God by the light of nature; as a trinity of persons in the Godhead; the knowledge of God in Christ as Mediator; the God-man and Mediator Jesus Christ; his incarnation, sufferings, death, and resurrection; the will of God to save sinners by a crucified Jesus; the several peculiar doctrines of the Gospel, particularly the resurrection of the dead, and the manner of worshipping of God with acceptance: but then there are some things which may be known of God, without a revelation. Adam had a perfect knowledge of him; and his sons, though fallen, even the very Heathens have some notion of him, as that there is a God; and by the light of nature it might be known that there is but one God, who is glorious, full of majesty, and possessed of all perfections, as that he is all powerful, wise, good and righteous: and this <p>is manifest in them, or "to them"; by the light that is given them: it is light by which that which may be known of God is manifest; and this is the light of nature, which every man has that comes into the world; and this is internal, it is in him, in his mind and conscience, and is communicated to him by God, and that by infusion or inspiration; see <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; <p>for God hath showed it unto them; what may be known of him by that light; and which is assisted and may be improved by a consideration of the works of creation and Providence. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.</span><p>(9) By their ungodliness he proves that although all men have a most clear and evident mirror in which to behold the everlasting and almighty nature of God, even in his creatures, yet they have fallen away from those principles to most foolish and stupid ideas of their own brains, in their worship of God and of what God requires of them.<p>(c) In their hearts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διότι</span>] <span class="ital">propterea quod</span>—only to be separated by a comma from the foregoing—specifies <span class="ital">more precisely</span> the <span class="ital">causal relation, on account of which</span> the wrath of God comes upon such men, etc. (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>).

Meanwhile Scripture itself teaches that <span class="ital">in an inner sense</span> God <span class="ital">is</span> “unknowable,” until revealed. (<a href="/context/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes....">Matthew 11:25-27</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “<span class="ital">because</span>” points to the “holding down” just before: q. d., “they hold down the truth; and it <span class="ital">needs</span> holding down, as a living thing, if it is to be kept out of the way; because it is, as a fact, known to them.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in them</span>] Or, <span class="bld">amongst them</span>.

It must be observed in general, however, that in the Greek of the N. T. the aorist <span class="ital">sometimes</span> practically covers the ground of the perfect.—The point of this verse thus may be that “God <span class="ital">hath</span> [in abiding effect] manifested, &c.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ γνωστόν</span>) the fact that God is known: that principle, that God makes Himself known; that is to say, the existence of <span class="ital">an acquaintance with, or knowledge of, God</span> [the fact of <span class="ital">God</span> <span class="ital">being known; the objective knowledge of God</span>], not merely that He can be known.
