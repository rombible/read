It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Concerning his Son - This is connected with the first verse, with the word "gospel." The gospel of God concerning his Son. The design of the gospel was to make a communication relative to his Son Jesus Christ. This is the whole of it. There is no "good news" to man respecting salvation except what comes by Jesus Christ.<p>Which was made - The word translated "was made" means usually "to be," or "to become." It is used, however, in the sense of being born. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, "God sent forth his Son made of a woman," born of a woman. <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, "before Abraham was (born), I am." In this sense it seems to be used here, who was born, or descended from the seed of David.<p>Of the seed of David - Of the posterity or lineage of David. He was a descendant of David. David was perhaps the most illustrious of the kings of Israel. The promise to him was that there should not fail a man to sit on this throne; <a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a>. This ancient promise was understood as referring to the Messiah, and hence, in the New Testament he is called the descendant of David, and so much pains is taken to show that he was of his line; <a href="/luke/1-27.htm">Luke 1:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-45.htm">Matthew 22:45</a>; <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>. As the Jews universally believed that the Messiah would be descended from David <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>, it was of great importance for the sacred writers to make it out clearly that Jesus of Nazareth was of that line and family. Hence, it happened, that though our Saviour was humble, and poor, and obscure, yet he had that on which no small part of the world have been accustomed so much to pride themselves, an illustrious ancestry. To a Jew there could be scarcely any honor so high as to be descended from the best of their kings; and it shows how little the Lord Jesus esteemed the honors of this world, that he could always evince his deep humility in circumstances where people are usually proud; and that when he spoke of the honors of this world, and told how little they were worth, he was not denouncing what was not within his reach.<p>According to the flesh - The word "flesh," &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;  sarx, is used in the Scriptures in a great variety of significations.<p>(1) it denotes, as with us, the flesh literally of any living being; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones," etc.<p>(2) the animal system, the body, including flesh and bones, the visible part of man, in distinction from the invisible, or the soul; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>, "Neither did his flesh (his body) "see corruption." <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-39.htm">1 Corinthians 15:39</a>.<p>(3) the man, the whole animated system, body and soul; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "In the likeness of sinful flesh. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="/luke/3-6.htm">Luke 3:6</a>.<p>(4) human nature. As a man. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>, "God hath sworn with an oath that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, that is, in his human nature, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne." <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>, "whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever." The same is its meaning here. He was a descendant of David in his human nature, or as a man. This implies, of course, that he had another nature besides his human, or that while he was a man he was also something else; that there was a nature in which he was not descended from David.<p>That this is its meaning will still further appear by the following observations.<p>(1) the apostle expressly makes a contrast between his condition according to the flesh, and that according to the spirit of holiness.<p>(2) the expression "according to the flesh" is applied to no other one in the New Testament but to Jesus Christ. Though the word "flesh" often occurs, and is often used to denote man, yet the special expression, "according to the flesh" occurs in no other connection.<p>In all the Scriptures it is never said of any prophet or apostle, any lawgiver or king, or any man in any capacity, that he came in the flesh, or that he was descended from certain ancestors according to the flesh. Nor is such an expression ever used any where else. If it were applied to a mere man, we should instantly ask in what other way could he come than in the flesh? Has he a higher nature? Is he an angel, or a seraph? The expression would be unmeaningful. And when, therefore, it is applied to Jesus Christ, it implies, if language has any meaning, that there was a sense in which Jesus was not descended from David. What that was, appears in the next verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

And this seems to show the excellency of the gospel, that it doth not treat of vulgar and ordinary matters. as of the gods of the Gentiles, or the actions of Alexander, Caesar, the Scipios, or such like heroes; but of the Son of God himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which was made; </span> i.e. as he afterwards expresseth it, according to the flesh, or his human nature: in regard of his Divine subsistence, he was begotten and not made; in regard of his manhood, he was made and not begotten.

This place proves clearly these two truths: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That in the person of Jesus Christ there are two natures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

This <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ ἉΓΙΩΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is, in contradistinction to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span>, the other side of the being of the Son of God on earth; and, just as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span> was the outward element perceptible by the senses, so is the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> the inward mental element, the substratum of His <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΟῦς</span></span></span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?

For the same conception, see <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ γὰρ υἱὸς Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν διʼ ἡμῶν κηρυχθείς</span>. Taken by itself, “the Son of God” is, in the first instance, a title rather than a name. It goes back to <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>; the person to whom it is applied is conceived as the chosen object of the Divine love, God’s instrument for accomplishing the salvation of His people. (Weiss.) The description which follows does not enable us to answer all the questions it raises, yet it is sufficiently clear. “The Son of God” was born of the seed of David according to the flesh. For <span class="greekheb">γενομένου</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>; for David, <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2 Timothy 2:8</a>, where, as here, the Davidic descent is an essential part of the Pauline Gospel. That it was generally preached and recognised in the primitive Church is proved by these passages, as well as by <a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm" title="For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.">Hebrews 7:14</a> and the genealogies in Matthew and Luke; yet it seems a fair inference from our Lord’s question in <a href="/mark/12-35.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?">Mark 12:35</a> ff. that for Him it had no real importance. Those who did not directly see in Jesus one transcendently greater than David would not recognise in Him the Saviour by being convinced of His Davidic descent. This person, of royal lineage, was “declared Son of God, with power, according to the spirit of holiness, in virtue of resurrection from the dead”. The word <span class="greekheb">ὁρισθέντος</span> is ambiguous; in <a href="/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>, it is used to describe the appointment of Christ to judge the living and the dead, and is rendered in A.V. “ordained”. If to be Son of God were merely an office or a dignity, like that of judge of the world, this meaning might be defended here. There is an approximation to such an idea in <a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>, where also Paul is the speaker. “God,” he says, “has fulfilled His promise by raising up Jesus; as it is written also in the second Psalm, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.” Here the resurrection day, strictly speaking, is the birthday of the Son of God; sonship is a dignity to which He is exalted after death. But in view of passages like <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:">Php 2:5</a> f., it is impossible to suppose that Paul limited his use of Son of God in this way; even while Jesus lived on earth there was that in Him which no connection with David could explain, but which rested on a relation to God; the resurrection only declared Him to be what He truly was—just as in the Psalm, for that matter, the bold words, This day have I begotten Thee, may be said to refer, not to the right and title, but to the coronation of the King. In virtue of His resurrection, which is here conceived, not as <span class="ital">from</span> the dead (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>), but of the dead (<span class="greekheb">ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν</span>—a resurrection exemplifying, and so guaranteeing, that of others), Christ is established in that dignity which is His, and which answers to His nature. The expression <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πνεῦμα ἁγιωσύνης</span> characterises Christ ethically, as <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> does physically. Not that it makes the sonship in question “ethical” as opposed to “metaphysical”: no such distinctions were in the Apostle’s thought. But the sonship, which was declared by the resurrection, answered to (<span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>) the spirit of holiness which was the inmost and deepest reality in the Person and life of Jesus. The sense that there is that in Christ which is explained by his connection with mankind, and that also which can only be explained by some peculiar relation to God, is no doubt conveyed in this description, and is the basis of the orthodox doctrine of the two natures in the one Person of the Lord; but it is a mistake to say that that doctrine is formulated here. The connection of the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν δυνάμει</span> is doubtful. They have been joined to <span class="greekheb">ὁρισθέντος</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.">2 Corinthians 13:4</a> : <span class="greekheb">ζῇ ἐκ δυνάμεως θεοῦ</span>): declared to be Son of God “by a miracle,” a mighty work wrought by God; and also with <span class="greekheb">υἱοῦ θεοῦ</span> = Son of God, not in humiliation, but “in power,” a power demonstrated by the gift of thè Spirit and its operations in the Church. “Jesus, Messiah, Our Lord,” summarises all this. “Our Lord” is the most compendious expression of the Christian consciousness. (A. B. Bruce, <span class="ital">Apologetics</span>, 398 ff.) “The whole Gospel of Paul is comprehended in this historical Jesus, who has appeared in flesh, but who, on the ground of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἁγιωσύνης</span>, which constitutes His essence, has been exalted as Christ and Lord.” (Lipsius.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">concerning his Son</span>, &c.] The connexion is with the close of <a href="/romans/1-2.htm" title="(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)">Romans 1:2</a> : the “promise through the prophets” was “concerning the Son of God.” In the Gr., the order of words in this verse and the next is peculiar and emphatic: <span class="bld">concerning His Son, who was made</span> [lit. <span class="bld">who came to be, who became] of the seed of David according to the flesh; who was marked out as the Son of God, in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, in consequence of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the seed of David</span>] The N.

This is the foundation of all rightful access, on the part of Jesus Christ, to His Father and His God; and, in like manner, of our approach by Him, as <span class="ital">our Lord</span>, to His Father and our Father, to His God and our God, who has delivered us to Him as His peculiar property. Even before His humiliation, He was indeed the Son of God; but this Sonship was in occultation by His humiliation, and was at length fully disclosed to us after His resurrection. His justification depends on these facts, <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

Hence, in His passion, He placed all His confidence in the Father, not on account of His works (for not even did the Son give first to the Father any thing, which the Father was bound to pay back to Him), but for this reason, because He was the Son; and thus He went before us in the way, as the leader and finisher of our faith. <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which was made</span>; <span class="accented">or, was born.</span> But the word in itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, need only mean that <span class="accented">he became</span> a Man of the seed of David; implying, it would seem, a pre-existence of him who so became.

Here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> denotes the merely human descent of Jesus in distinction from his Divine Being (cf. <a href="/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>; <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>). His having come humanly "of the seed of David" is suitably noted here, where "the Son" is being set forth as fulfilling the Old Testament promises; for they uniformly represent the Messiah as thus descended, and it was essential to the Jewish conception of him that he should be so (cf. <a href="/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>; <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>; and for the stress laid by the writers of the New Testament on the fact that Jesus was so - of which fact no doubt was entertained - cf. <a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, etc. See, among many other passages, <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>; <a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). Meyer, commenting on the verse before us, goes somewhat out of his way to set forth that only Joseph's, not Mary's, descent from David was in St. Paul's mind, saying that "the Davidic descent of the mother of Jesus can by no means be established from the New Testament," and also that "Paul nowhere indicates the view of a supernatural generation of the bodily nature of Jesus." As to the first of these assertions, it may be observed that, in the opening chapters of our Gospel of St. Luke (representing certainly the early belief of the Church) our Lord seems to be regarded as actually descended from David - not legally so accounted only - though, at the same time, his supernatural generation is distinctly asserted (comp. <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a> with Luke 1:35). Hence we are led to infer Mary's, as well as Joseph's, descent from David, whether or not either of the genealogies given in St. Matthew's and St. Luke's Gospels represents hers. Further, with respect to those two genealogies (evidently independent ones, and both probably got from genealogical records preserved at Jerusalem), a probable way of accounting for the two distinct lines of descent through which Joseph seems to be traced to David, is to suppose one of them to be really Mary's, the legal representative of whose family Joseph had become by marriage, so as to be entered in legal documents as the son of her father (see art. on "Genealogy of Jesus Christ," in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' W. Smith, LL.D.). As to Meyer's second assertion above alluded to, it is true that St. Paul nowhere refers to our Lord's supernatural conception spoken of in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. But it does not follow that it was not already included in the Church's creed, or that St. Paul himself was unaware of it or disbelieved it. This is not the place for enlarging on the evidence, at the present day increasing in force, of the early origin of our existing Gospels, and of their being a true embodiment of the Church's original belief. St. Paul's silence as to the manner how the Son of God became incarnate may be accounted for by his not having had occasion, in his extant Epistles, to speak of it. He is occupied, in accordance with his peculiar mission, in setting forth the meaning and purpose of the Incarnation rather than its mode, and in preaching rather than catechetical instruction; and on the essential idea involved he is sufficiently explicit, viz. the peculiar Divine paternity of Christ, notwithstanding the human birth. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Concerning His son<p>Connect with promised afore.
