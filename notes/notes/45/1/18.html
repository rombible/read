The proof is seen in the present condition both of the Gentile and Jewish world. And first of the Gentile world, <a href="/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18-32</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Revealed.</span>—The revelation of righteousness is, while the Apostle writes, being made in the Person of Christ and in the salvation offered by Him.

Having laid down this proposition, the apostle now enters upon the proof it. His first argument is, the law, whether of nature or of supernatural revelation, condemns all men as having violated it, and as being under sin. No one, therefore, is justified by the works of the law. This is treated of to <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>. And hence he infers, therefore, justification is by faith. <span class="ital">The wrath of God is revealed </span>— Here and in the preceding verse mention is made of a two-fold revelation, of wrath and of righteousness: the former, little known to nature, is revealed by the law; the latter, wholly unknown to nature, by the gospel. The wrath of God, due to the sins of men, is also revealed by frequent and signal interpositions of divine providence; in all parts of the Sacred Oracles; by God’s inspired messengers, whether under the Jewish or Christian dispensations; and by the consciences of sinners, clearly teaching that God will severely punish all sin, whether committed against God or man; <span class="ital">from heaven </span>— This speaks the majesty of Him whose wrath is revealed, his all-seeing eye, his strict and impartial justice, and the extent of his wrath: whatever is under heaven, is under the effects of his wrath, believers in Christ excepted; <span class="ital">against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men </span>— He speaks chiefly of the heathen; and the term <span class="ital">ungodliness </span>seems especially to refer to their atheism, polytheism, and idolatry, comprehending, however, every kind and degree of impiety and profaneness; and <span class="ital">unrighteousness </span>includes their other miscarriages and vices, their offences against truth, justice, mercy, charity toward one another, with their various acts of intemperance and lewdness. According to which sense of the words, they are distinctly treated of by the apostle in the following verses. <span class="ital">Who hold the truth in unrighteousness </span>— Which word here includes <span class="ital">ungodliness </span>also; that is, who, in some measure at least, know the truth, but do not obey it, acting in opposition to their knowledge, and the conviction of their own consciences. Or, as the word <span class="greekheb">κατεχοντων </span>properly signifies, <span class="ital">who detain, </span>or imprison, as it were, <span class="ital">the truth in unrighteousness. </span>He thus expresses himself, because the truth made known, in some degree, struggles against men’s wickedness, reproves them for it, dissuades them from it, and warns them of punishment impending over it. All mankind, even the heathen, have been and are acquainted with many truths concerning moral duties, due to God, their fellow-creatures, and themselves. But, not hearkening to the voice of these truths, but resisting their influence, and disregarding their warnings, they have been and still are more or less involved in guilt, and exposed to condemnation and wrath. Dr. Macknight, who translates this clause, <span class="ital">who confine the truth by unrighteousness, </span>thinks the apostle speaks chiefly with a reference to the philosophers, legislators, and magistrates among the Greeks and Romans, who concealed the truth concerning God from the vulgar, by their unrighteous institutions. “The meaning,” says he, “is, that the knowledge of the one true God, the Maker and Governor of the universe, which the persons here spoken of had attained by contemplating the works of creation, they did not discover to the rest of mankind; but confined it in their own breasts as in a prison, by the most flagrant unrighteousness. For they presented, as objects of worship, beings which are not by their nature God; nay, beings of the most immoral characters; and by so doing, as well as by the infamous rites with which they appointed these false gods to be worshipped, they led mankind into the grossest errors, concerning the nature and attributes of the proper object of their worship. This corrupt form of religion, though extremely acceptable to the common people, was not contrived and established by them. In all countries they were grossly ignorant of God, and of the worship which he required. — They therefore could not be charged with the crime of concealing the truth concerning God. The persons guilty of that crime were the legislators, who first formed mankind into cities and states, and who, as the apostle observes, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>, <span class="ital">though they knew God, did not glorify him as God, </span>by making him the object of the people’s worship, but unrighteously established polytheism and idolatry as the public religion. Of the same crime the magistrates and philosophers were likewise guilty, who, in after times, by their precepts and examples, upheld the established religion. Of this number were Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato, whom, therefore, we may suppose the apostle had here in his eye. For although these men had attained [in some degree] the knowledge of the true God, none of them worshipped him publicly, neither did they declare him to the people, that they might worship him. Plato himself held that the knowledge of the one God was not to be divulged. See Euseb., <span class="ital">Præpar. Evang., </span>lib. 10. cap. 9. And in his <span class="ital">Timæus, </span>he says expressly, ‘It is neither easy to find the Parent of the universe, nor safe to discover him to the vulgar, when found.’ The same conduct was observed by Seneca, as Augustine hath proved from his writings, <span class="ital">De Civit. Dei., </span>lib. 6. cap. 10. The same Augustine, in his book, <span class="ital">De Vera Relig., </span>cap. 5, blames the philosophers in general, because they practised the most abominable idolatries with the vulgar, although, in their schools, they delivered doctrines concerning the nature of the gods, inconsistent with the established worship.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - This word denotes that the apostle is about to give a reason for what he had just said. This verse commences the argument of the Epistle. an argument designed to establish the proposition advanced in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The proposition is, that God's plan of justification is revealed in the gospel. To show this, it was necessary to show that all other plans had failed; and that there was need of some new plan or scheme to save people. To this he devotes this and the two following chapters. The design of this argument is, to show that people were sinners. And in order to make this out, it was necessary to show that they were under law. This was clear in regard to the Jews. They had the Scriptures; and the apostle in this chapter shows that it was equally clear in regard to the Gentiles, and then proceeds to show that both had failed of obeying the Law. To see this clearly it is necessary to add only, that there can be but two ways of justification conceived of; one by obedience to law, and the other by grace. The former was the one by which Jews and Gentiles had sought to be justified; and if it could be shown that in this they had failed, the way was clear to show that there was need of some other plan.<p>The wrath of God - &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;  &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  orge&#772; Theou. The word rendered "wrath" properly denotes that earnest appetite or desire by which we seek anything, or an intense effort to obtain it. And it is particularly applied to the desire which a man has to take vengeance who is injured, and who is enraged. It is thus synonymous with revenge. <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>, "let all bitterness, and wrath, etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>, "anger, wrath, malice," etc.; <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>. But it is also often applied to God; and it is clear that when we think of the word as applicable to him, it must be divested of everything like human passion, and especially of the passion of revenge. As he cannot be injured by the sins of people <a href="//biblehub.com/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>, he has no motive for vengeance properly so called, and it is one of the most obvious rules of interpretation that we are not to apply to God passions and feelings which, among us, have their origin in evil.<p>In making a revelation, it was indispensable to use words which people used; but it does not follow that when applied to God they mean precisely what they do when applied to man. When the Saviour is said <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a> to have looked on his disciples with anger (Greek, "wrath," the same word is here), it is not to be supposed that he had the feelings of an implacable man seeking vengeance. The nature of the feeling is to be judged of by the character of the person. So, in this place, the word denotes the "divine displeasure" or "indignation" against sin; the divine purpose to "inflict punishment. It is the opposition of the divine character against sin;" and the determination of the divine mind to express that opposition in a proper way, by excluding the offender from the favors which he bestows on the righteous. It is not an unamiable, or arbitrary principle of conduct. We all admire the character of a father who is opposed to disorder, and vice, and disobedience in his family, and who expresses his opposition in a proper way.<p>We admire the character of a ruler who is opposed to all crime in the community, and who expresses those feelings in the laws. And the more he is opposed to vice and crime, the more we admire his character and his laws; and why shall we be not equally pleased with God, who is opposed to all crime in all parts of the universe, and who determines to express it in the proper way for the sake of preserving order and promoting peace? The phrase "divine displeasure" or "indignation," therefore, expresses the meaning of this phrase; see <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>, <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4-5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, etc. The word occurs 35 times in the New Testament.<p>Is revealed - That is, revealed to the Jews by their Law; and to the Gentiles in their reason, and conscience, as the apostle proceeds to show.<p>From heaven - This expression I take to mean simply that the divine displeasure against sin is made known by a divine appointment; by an arrangement of events, communications, and arguments, which evince that they have had their origin in heaven; or are divine. How this is, Paul proceeds to state, in the works of creation, and in the Law which the Hebrews had. A variety of meanings have been given to this expression, but this seems the most satisfactory. It does not mean that the wrath will be sent from heaven; or that the heavens declare his wrath; or that the heavenly bodies are proofs of his wrath against sin; or that Christ, the executioner of wrath, will be manifest from heaven (Origen, Cyril, Beza, etc.); or that it is from God who is in heaven; but that it is by an arrangement which shows that it had its origin in heaven. or has proofs that it is divine.<p>Against all ungodliness - This word properly means "impiety" toward God, or neglect of the worship and honor due to him. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  asebeian. It refers to the fact that people had failed to honor the true God, and had paid to idols the homage which was due to him. Multitudes also in every age refuse to honor him, and neglect his worship, though they are not idolaters. Many people suppose that if they do not neglect their duty to their fellow-men, if they are honest and upright in their dealings, they are not guilty, even though they are not righteous, or do not do their duty to God; as though it were a less crime to dishonor God than man; and as though it were innocence to neglect and disobey our Maker and Redeemer. The apostle here shows that the wrath of God is as really revealed against the neglect of God as it is against positive iniquity; and that this is an offence of so much consequence as to be placed "first," and as deserving the divine indignation more than the neglect of our duties toward people; compare <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>; <a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>; Jde 1:15, Jde 1:18. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament.<p>Unrighteousness of men - Unrighteousness, or iniquity toward people. All offences against our neighbor, our parents. our country, etc. The word "ungodliness" includes all crimes against God; this, all crimes against our fellow-men. The two words express what comprehends the violation of all the commands of God; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, etc. and thy neighbor as thyself," <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>. The wrath of God is thus revealed against all human wickedness.<p>Who hold the truth - Who "keep back," or "restrain" the truth. The word translated "hold" here, sometimes means to "maintain," to "keep," to "observe" <a href="/1_corinthians/7-30.htm">1 Corinthians 7:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; but it also means to "hold back, to detain, to hinder." <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a>, "the people sought him (Jesus), and came to him, and stayed him." (Greek, the same as here.) Plm 1:13, "whom I would have "retained" with me," etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>, "and now ye know what "withholdeth," etc. In this place it means also that they held back, or restrained the truth, by their wickedness.<p>The truth - The truth of God, in whatever way made known, and particularly, as the apostle goes on to say, what is made known by the light of nature. The truth pertaining to his perfections, his Law, etc. They hold it back. or restrain its influence.<p>In unrighteousness - Or rather, by their iniquity. Their wickedness is the cause why the truth had had so little progress among them, and had exerted so little influence. This was done by their yielding to corrupt passions and propensities, and by their being therefore unwilling to retain the knowledge of a pure and holy God, who is opposed to such deeds, and who will punish them. As they were determined to practice iniquity, they chose to exclude the knowledge of a pure God, and to worship impure idols, by which they might give a sanction to their lusts. Their vice and tendency to iniquity was, therefore, the reason why they had so little knowledge of a holy God; and by the love of this, they held back the truth from making progress, and becoming diffused among them.<p>The same thing is substantially true now. People hold back or resist the truth of the gospel by their sins in the following ways.<p>(1) people of influence and wealth employ both, in directly opposing the gospel.<p>(2) people directly resist the doctrines of religion. since they know they could not hold to those doctrines without abandoning their sins.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ro 1:18.

But before enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them all, their stifling the light which still remained to them. As darkness overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the heart, when the "still small voice" of conscience is first disregarded, next thwarted, and then systematically deadened. Thus "the truth" which God left with and in men, instead of having free scope and developing itself, as it otherwise would, was obstructed (compare Mt 6:22, 23; Eph 4:17, 18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He proceeds to prove the principal proposition laid down in the foregoing verse; the causal particle <span class="ital">for</span> implies as much. Men must be justified by the righteousness of God, because they have no righteousness of their own to justify them, they themselves are all unrighteous. This he proves both of the Gentiles and Jews. He begins with the Gentiles, and proves it upon them, from this verse to <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,">Romans 2:17</a></span>; and then he proves it upon the Jews also, from thence to the end of the 3rd chapter. <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/2-18.htm" title="And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;...">Romans 2:18-3</a>:31</span>}</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wrath of God is revealed; </span> it is revealed in the word of God, or rather, by the judgments which he inflicteth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From heaven; </span> i.e. from God in heaven.

These natural notions concerning God and their neighbour they did not obey and follow, but wickedly suppressed them. They imprisoned the truth which they acknowledged, that they might sin the more securely. The metaphor is taken from tyrants, who oppress the innocent, and imprison them: so the Gentiles did by the truth which they had by nature, they kept it in and under. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,.... The apostle having hinted at the doctrine of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ; and which he designed more largely to insist upon in this epistle, and to prove that there can be no justification of a sinner in the sight of God by the deeds of the law, in order to set this matter in a clear light, from hence, to the end of the chapter, and in the following ones, represents the sad estate and condition of the Gentiles with the law of nature, and of the Jews with the law of Moses; by which it most clearly appears, that neither of them could be justified by their obedience to the respective laws under which they were, but that they both stood in need of the righteousness of God. By "the wrath of God" is meant the displicency and indignation of God at sin and sinners; his punitive justice, and awful vengeance; the judgments which he executes in this world; and that everlasting displeasure of his, and wrath to come in another world, which all through sin are deserving of, some are appointed to, God's elect are delivered from, through Christ's sustaining it, in their room and stead, and which comes and abides on all impenitent and unbelieving persons. This is said to be "revealed", where? not in the Gospel, in which the righteousness of God is revealed; unless the Gospel be taken for the books of the four Evangelists, or for the Gospel dispensation, or for that part of the ministry of a Gospel preacher, which represents the wrath of God as the desert of sin, the dreadfulness of it, and the way to escape it; for the Gospel, strictly taken, is grace, good news, glad tidings, and not wrath and damnation; though indeed in Christ's sufferings for the sins of his people, which the Gospel gives us an account of, there is a great display of the wrath of God, and of his indignation against sin: but this wrath of God is revealed in the law, it is known by the light of nature, and to be perceived in the law of Moses, and may be observed in the Scriptures, where are many instances and examples of divine wrath and displeasure; as in the total destruction of the old world by a world wide flood, the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah, turning Lot's wife into a pillar of salt, the plagues of Egypt, and the several instances mentioned in this chapter. This wrath is said to be God's wrath "from heaven", by the awful blackness which covers the heavens, the storms and tempests raised in them, and by pouring down water or fire in a surprising manner, on the inhabitants of the world; or "from heaven", that is, openly, manifestly, in the sight of all; or from God who is in heaven, and not from second causes; and more especially it will be revealed from heaven, when Christ shall descend from thence at the day of judgment: the subject matter or object of it, <p>against, or "upon" which it is revealed, are, <p>all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; that is, all ungodly and unrighteous men; or all men who are guilty of ungodliness, the breach of the first table of the law, which respects the worship of God, and of unrighteousness, the breach of the second table of the law, which regards our neighbours' good: and these persons are further described as such, <p>who hold the truth in unrighteousness: meaning either such who know the Gospel, which is "the truth", and do not profess it openly, but hold and imprison it in their minds, which is a great piece of unrighteousness; or if they do profess it, do not live up to it in their lives: or rather the Gentile philosophers are designed, who are spoken of in the following verse; See Gill on <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>; who had some knowledge of the truth of the divine Being, and his perfections, and of the difference between moral good and evil; but did not like to retain it themselves, nor communicate all they knew to others, nor did they live according to that knowledge which they had. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> truth in unrighteousness;</span><p>(8) Another confirmation of the principal question: all men being considered in themselves, or without Christ, are guilty both of ungodliness and also unrighteousness, and therefore are subject on condemnation: therefore they need to seek righteousness in someone else.<p>(a) Against all types of ungodliness.<p>(b) By truth Paul means all the light that is left in man since his fall, not as though they being led by this were able to come into favour with God, but that their own reason might condemn them of wickedness both against God and man.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>.

The <span class="greekheb">ὀργὴ</span> of God is not to be explained with several of the Fathers (in Suicer), Erasmus, and many later authorities, as <span class="ital">poena divina</span>, which is nothing but a rationalizing interchange of ideas, but rather in the proper literal sense: <span class="ital">wrath</span>, an affection of the personal God, having a necessary connection with His love. The wrath of God, the reality of which is indisputable as the very presupposition of the work of atonement, is the love of the holy God (who is neither neutral nor one-sided in His affection) for all that is good in its energy as antagonistic to all that is evil.[421] Even Lactantius has aptly remarked, <span class="ital">de ira Dei</span>, v. 9 : “Si Deus non irascitur impiis et injustis, nee pios justosque diligit; in rebus enim diversis aut in utramque partem moveri necesse est, aut in neutram.” See on <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ οὐρανοῦ</span>] is neither to be connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓῊ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, as Beza, Estius, and many others hold, nor with the bare <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> (Mehring), but, as the order of the words and the parallel definition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a> require, belongs to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΠΤΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span>; so that heaven, the dwelling-place and throne of God (comp on <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>), is designated as the place from which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΆΛΥΨΙς</span></span></span> of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓῊ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> issues. “<span class="ital">Majestatem</span> irati Dei significat,” Bengel. The revelation of righteousness takes place <span class="greekheb">ἐν εὐαγγελίῳ</span>, <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, as something spiritually brought home to the consciousness through the medium of the Gospel; but that of the divine wrath descends <span class="ital">from heaven</span>, manifested as a divine matter of fact; by which description, however, the <span class="ital">destructive</span> character of this working of divine power is not expressed (Th. Schott), although it is in fact implied in the entire context. <span class="ital">But what revelation of divine wrath is meant?</span> Paul himself supplies the information in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a> ff., in which is described what God in His sufficiently well-grounded (<a href="/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them....">Romans 1:19-23</a>) wrath did (<span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν αὐτούς</span>). God’s wrath therefore is revealed from heaven <span class="ital">in this way</span>, that those who are the objects of it are given up by God to terrible retribution in unchastity and all vice. Against this interpretation (comp Mehring), which is adopted also by Tholuck, Weber (<span class="ital">vom Zorne Gottes</span>, p. 89), and Th. Schott, it cannot be objected, with Hofmann, that Paul must have written <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκαλύφθη</span>; for he here in fact expresses the <span class="ital">general</span> proposition of experience, to which the concrete <span class="ital">historical</span> representation subsequently shall correspond; the divine <span class="ital">axiom</span> is placed first (<span class="ital">present</span>), and then the history of it follows (<span class="ital">aorist</span>). Irrelevant is also the objection of Philippi, that <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτειν</span> always denotes a <span class="ital">supernatural</span> revelation. For <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτειν</span> means to <span class="ital">reveal</span> what was previously unknown, what was veiled from our cognition, <span class="ital">so that it now becomes manifest;</span> and, in reference to this, it is a matter of indifference whether the revelation takes place in a natural or in a supernatural manner.[424] The <span class="ital">mode</span> of revealing is not indicated in the word itself, but in the context; and hence according to the connection it is used also, as here, of a revelation <span class="ital">in fact</span>, by which a state of things previously unknown comes to our knowledge (<a href="/matthew/10-26.htm" title="Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.">Matthew 10:26</a>; <a href="/luke/2-35.htm" title="(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). Moreover, even according to our interpretation, a <span class="ital">divine</span> revelation is meant, by which there is certainly brought to light a <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>, namely, the connection of the phenomenon with the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span>. According to others, Paul means the <span class="ital">inward</span> revelation of the divine wrath, given by means of <span class="ital">reason and conscience</span> (Ambrosiaster, Wolf, and others, including Reiche and Glöckler), in support of which view they appeal to <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>. But, on the contrary, <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ οὐρανοῦ</span> requires us to understand an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΨΙς</span></span></span> <span class="ital">cognisable by the senses;</span> and <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a> contains not the <span class="ital">mode</span> of the manifestation of wrath, but its <span class="ital">moving cause</span> (<span class="greekheb">διότι</span>). Others hold that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΨΙς</span></span></span> of the divine wrath has come <span class="ital">through the Gospel</span> (“continens minas,” Grotius), and that <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> is to be again supplied from <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>. So Aquinas, Bellarmine, Corn, à Lapide, Estius, Grotius, Heumann, Semler, Morus, Böhme, Benecke, Maier; comp Umbreit, who includes also the Old Testament. It is decisive against this view that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠʼ ΟὐΡΑΝΟῦ</span></span></span>, just because it is parallel to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, lays down a mode of manifestation quite different from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>. Had the latter been again in Paul’s mind here, he would have repeated it with emphasis, as he has repeated the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΠΤΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span>. Others hold that the manifestation of wrath <span class="ital">at the general judgment</span> is meant (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Toletus, Limborch, Koppe, Philippi, Reithmayr, and Ewald). The present, considered in itself, might be chosen in order to express a vivid realisation of the future, or might be accounted for by the <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, which, it is alleged, is to be again mentally supplied (Ewald); but the former explanation is to be rejected on account of the preceding purely present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛ</span></span></span>. in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; and against the latter may be urged the very fact, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span> is not repeated. Had this been the meaning, moreover, the further course of the exposition must have borne reference to the general judgment, which it by no means does; and therefore this interpretation is opposed to the connection, as well as unwarranted by <a href="/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a> (where the mention of the revelation of judgment belongs to quite a different connection); and not required by the idea of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΠΤΕΙΝ</span></span></span> itself, since that idea is adequately met by the divine matter-of-fact revelation of wrath here intended (see above), and besides, the word is repeated intentionally for rhetorical effect. Lastly, while others have contented themselves with leaving the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΨΙς</span></span></span> here <span class="ital">in its entire generality</span> (Olshausen, Tholuck; comp Calovius), and thus relieved themselves from giving any explanation of it, the reference to the religion of the O. T. (Bengel and Flatt) seems entirely arbitrary and groundless, and the interpretations which apply it to <span class="ital">evils generally</span> affecting the world as an expression of the divine wrath (Hofmann), or to the external and internal <span class="ital">distress of the time</span> (Baumgarten-Crusius), are too general and indefinite, and thereby devoid of any concrete import in keeping with the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πᾶσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀσέβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀδικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.] contains the <span class="ital">hostile direction</span> (comp Dem. 743, 22) of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΛΎΠΤΕΤΑΙ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΡΑΝΟῦ</span></span></span>: <span class="ital">against every ungodliness and immorality of men</span>, which, etc. <span class="greekheb">Ἀσέβεια</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΔΙΚΊΑ</span></span></span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Prot.</span> p. 323 E; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr.</span> viii. 8, 7; Tittmann, <span class="ital">Synon.

This is plain from the sequel, though the Gr. leaves it possible (grammatically) to render “of those men who hold, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who hold</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">who hold down</span>. The verb has several shades of meaning, and frequently = “to hold fast.” So e.g. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; (E. V., “keep;”) <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>. But the context here decides for the meaning “hold down, hold back, suppress.” The verb occurs once again in this Epistle, <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a> : “wherein we were <span class="ital">held</span>,” i.e. “held down as captives.” Here the phrase is pregnant:—“who suppress the truth, living in unrighteousness the while.” “The Truth” (of the awful Majesty of God) is, as it were, <span class="ital">buried</span> under sinful acts, though still <span class="ital">alive</span>, still needing to be “held down,” if sin is to rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκαλύπτεται</span>, <span class="ital">is revealed</span>) See verse 17, note.—<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) The particle begins the discussion; the Statement of Subject [Proposition] being now concluded, ch. <a href="/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>; <a href="/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>. The Latins generally omit it.[11] This is Paul’s first argument: All are under sin; and that the law shows; therefore, no one is justified by the works of the law. The discussion of this point continues to the third chapter, <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>.

Wrath is, as it were, different, when directed against the Gentiles, and when against the Jews. The righteousness and the wrath of God form, in some measure, an antithesis. The righteousness of the world crushes the guilty individual; the righteousness of God crushes beneath it the sin, and restores the sinner.

Here the argumentation of the Epistle begins, the first position to be established being that all mankind without exception is guilty of sin before God, and therefore unable of itself to put in a plea of <span class="accented">righteousness.</span> This being proved, the need of the revelation of <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span>, announced in ver. 17, appears. "The wrath of God" is an expression with which we are familiar in the Bible, being one of those in which human emotions are attributed to God in accommodation to the exigencies of human thought. It denotes his essential holiness, his antagonism to sin, to which punishment is due. It expresses an idea as essential to our conception of the Divine righteousness as do the words, "love" and "mercy." Wrath, or indignation, against evil is as necessary to our ideal of a perfect <span class="accented">human</span> being as is love of good; and therefore we attribute wrath to the perfect Divine Being, using of necessity human terms for expressing our conception of the Divine attributes. When the Name of the LORD Was proclaimed before Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>, etc.), it was of One not only "merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth," but also "that will by no means clear the guilty." This last attribute is the same as what we mean by the Divine wrath. This "wrath of God" is said in the verse before us to be "revealed from heaven." How so? Is it in the gospel, as is God's righteousness (ver. 18)? Against this view is the change of expression - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x28;</span> as well as the fact that the gospel is not in itself a revelation of wrath, but the very opposite. Is it in the Old Testament? Possibly in part; but the marked repetition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense seems to point to some obvious revelation <span class="accented">now</span>; and, further, the first part of the proof, to the end of the second chapter, does not rest on the Old Testament. Is it what the apostle proceeds so forcibly to draw attention to - the existing, and at that time notorious, moral degradation of heathen society, which he regards as evidence of Divine judgment? This may have been before his view; and, as he goes on at once to speak of it, it probably was so prominently. But the revelation of Divine wrath against sin seems to imply more than this as the argument goes on, viz. the evident guilt before God of all mankind alike, and not only of degraded heathenism. It is difficult to decide, among the various explanations that have been offered, on any specific mode of revelation which the writer had in view. Perhaps no particular one exclusively. Commentators may be often unduly anxious to affix an exact sense to pregnant words used by St. Paul, who so often indicates comprehensive ideas by short phrases. He may have had before his mind various concurrent signs of human guilt, and the Divine wrath against it, at that especial time of the world's history; all which, to his mind at least, brought conviction as by a light from heaven. And the gospel itself (though in its essence a revelation of mercy, so that he purposely avoids saying that wrath was in it revealed) still had been the most powerful means of all for bringing home a conviction of the Divine wrath to the consciences of believers. For its first office is to convince of sin and of judgment. Cf. the words of the forerunner, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" On all such grounds we may conceive that the apostle spoke of the wrath of God against human sin being especially at that time plainly revealed from heaven; and he desires to bring his readers to perceive it as he did. For now was the time of the Divine purpose to bring it home to all (cf. <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent"). "All ungodliness and unrighteousness' (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) comprehends all evil-doing, in whatever aspect viewed, whether as impiety or as wrong. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, "who hold the truth." If the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> allowed this rendering here, it would indeed be intelligible in reference to the knowledge of God, even by nature, which all men have or ought to have, though they do not act upon it, and the very potential possession of which renders them guilty. This is the thought of what immediately follows. Thus the sense would be, "They <span class="accented">hold</span>, i.e. possess, the truth; but they do unrighteousness." But whenever <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to hold," it denotes a firm hold, not a loose hold, such as would be thus implied. It occurs in this sense in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a> ("I praise you that ye <span class="accented">keep</span> the ordinances"). and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> ("<span class="accented">Hold fast</span> that which is good"). We must, therefore, have recourse to a second sense in which the verb is also used - that of "keeping back," or "restraining." Thus <a href="/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a> ("The people <span class="accented">stayed</span> him, that he should not depart from them") and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a> ("Ye know what <span class="accented">withholdeth"</span>). The reference is still to the innate knowledge of God which all men are supposed to have had originally; but the idea expressed is not their <span class="accented">having</span> it, but their <span class="accented">suppressing</span> it.
