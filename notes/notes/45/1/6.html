It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among whom - That is, among the Gentiles who had become obedient to the Christian faith in accordance with the design of the gospel, <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>. This proves that the church at Rome was made up partly at least, if not mainly, of Gentiles or pagans. This is fully proved in the xvith. chapter by the names of the persons whom Paul salutes.<p>The called of Jesus Christ - Those whom Jesus Christ has called to be his followers. The word "called" (see <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>) denotes not merely an external invitation to privilege, but it also denotes the "internal" or "effectual" call which secures conformity to the will of him who calls, and is thus synonymous with the name Christians, or believers. That true Christians are contemplated by this address, is clear from the whole scope of the Epistle; see particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>; compare <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The Romans, though they were the chief, were among the nations of the world to whom the apostles were sent; and since Paul was called to be an apostle, and had, as others, grace and apostleship, and particularly the apostleship of the uncircumcision, or was ordained a teacher of the Gentiles, more especially he was an apostle to them, and as such was to be regarded by them. This seems to point out what they were originally; they were among all nations which lay in darkness; and were without Christ and hope, and God in the world; but now, <p>the called of Jesus Christ. The calling here spoken of is not to an office, or a mere external one by the ministry of the word, but an internal special call by the grace of God; and which is irresistible, efficacious, and unchangeable, and is an high, holy, and heavenly one; by it persons are called out of darkness into light, out of bondage into liberty, out of the world, from the company of the men of it, and the sinful pleasures thereof, to fellowship with Christ and his saints, and off a dependence on themselves, and their own righteousness, to the grace and righteousness of Christ, and to eternal glory. The persons so called are the elect of God, who are secured in Christ, and redeemed by him, and who has a concern with the Father and Spirit in the calling of them: hence they are styled, "the called of Jesus Christ"; they are called by him, and after his name; he has an interest in them; as they were before his chosen and redeemed ones, they are now his called ones; as Jacob and Israel of old were named of God,  "my called", <a href="/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>; so these were named Christ's called ones; and who by calling came to be partakers of him and of his grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Among whom are ye also the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> called of Jesus Christ:</span><p>(n) Who through God's goodness belong to Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6</a>.

The reference of the <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> to <span class="ital">Paul</span> (Th.

There is one and the same grace, one and the same peace, from God and Christ.
