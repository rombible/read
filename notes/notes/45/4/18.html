<span class="ital">believed in hope </span>— With an assured confidence, grounded on the divine promise; <span class="ital">according to all that which was spoken </span>— When God called him forth abroad to view the stars of heaven. <span class="ital">So shall thy seed be </span>— So numerous and glorious. <span class="ital">And being not weak in faith </span>— That is, being strong in faith;

He did not regard it so as to be discouraged thereby, or induced to disbelieve the promise. The children which Abraham had by Keturah, after Sarah’s death, do not invalidate the apostle’s assertion here; for Abraham’s body, having been renewed by a miracle in order to the begetting of Isaac, might preserve its vigour for a considerable time afterward. Nor did he consider or regard the old age of Sarah. <span class="ital">He staggered not — </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">εις την επαγγελιαν του θεου ου διεκριθη τη απιστια</span>, <span class="ital">against the promise of God he did not reason; through unbelief</span> — Did not call in question the truth of God’s promise, or the certainty of its fulfilment; <span class="ital">but was strong in faith, giving glory to God </span>— Entertaining high and honourable thoughts of God’s power and faithfulness, and manifesting the same by his actions. “We are told, indeed, that when God declared that Sarah was to be the mother of nations, <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm" title="Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?">Genesis 17:17</a>, <span class="ital">Abraham fell upon his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? </span>&c. But these questions did not proceed from unbelief, but from admiration and gratitude, as may be gathered from the posture into which he put himself. And with respect to his <span class="ital">laughing, </span>it did not imply any doubt of God’s promise, otherwise he would have been rebuked, as Sarah was for her laughing: but it means simply, that he rejoiced at God’s promise; for in the Hebrew language, <span class="ital">to laugh </span>signifies <span class="ital">to rejoice, </span><a href="/genesis/21-6.htm" title="And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.">Genesis 21:6</a>, <span class="ital">God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me; </span>consequently the passage may be translated, <span class="ital">Abraham rejoiced and said, </span>&c.” <span class="ital">And being fully persuaded </span>— Through the knowledge which he had of the divine perfections; <span class="ital">that what he had promised </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ο επηγγελται</span>, <span class="ital">that what was promised; he was able, </span>and willing also, <span class="ital">to perform </span>— He believed God to be most faithful, and sure never to fail in the performance of his promises; collecting nothing else from the difficulty and improbability of the matter, but that it was the fitter for an Almighty power to effect; <span class="ital">and therefore it</span> — His faith; <span class="ital">was imputed to him for righteousness </span>— He was justified by it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-22 The promise was made to Abraham long before the law. It points at Christ, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who against hope - Who against all apparent or usual ground of hope.

See Burton, § 145. <span class="greekheb">δοὺς δόξαν τῷ θεῷ</span>: for this Hebraism see <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm" title="Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, <a href="/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>, <a href="/acts/12-23.htm" title="And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.">Acts 12:23</a>.

Here perhaps the first is subjective hope, the second objective.

This is interesting, as an example of <span class="ital">allusive</span> quotation. St Paul takes it for granted that the reader <span class="ital">knows the context</span>, and thus understands the force of the “so.” Cp. <a href="/context/hebrews/6-13.htm" title="For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,...">Hebrews 6:13-14</a>, where the very point of the quotation lies in the unquoted context. But that passage, addressed to Jewish disciples, is less remarkable than this, addressed to a mixed, and chiefly Gentile, Church. We have here a significant note of the Apostle’s encouragement of minute study of the O. T. among his <span class="ital">Gentile</span> converts.—No doubt allusive quotation was much used by the Rabbis; but St Paul would not have used it with Gentiles had he not felt it to be in place.—Notice that the words here quoted immediately precede (in Genesis 15) the words “Abraham believed God, &c.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/4-18.htm" title="Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be.">Romans 4:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παρʼ ἐλπίδα ἐπʼ ἐλπίδι ἐπίστευσεν</span>, <span class="ital">past</span> [<span class="ital">against</span>] <span class="ital">hope believed in hope</span>) We lay hold of one and the same object both by <span class="ital">faith</span> and <span class="ital">by hope; by faith</span>, as a thing, which is truthfully enunciated [proclaimed]; <span class="ital">by hope</span>, as an object of joy, which for certain both can and will realized. <span class="ital">He believed in the hope</span> of the promise, <span class="ital">past</span> [<span class="ital">beyond</span>, ‘præter’] <span class="ital">the hope</span> of reason, [which reason would have suggested]. <span class="greekheb">παρὰ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span>, <span class="ital">past</span> [against] and <span class="ital">in</span>, the particles opposed to each other, produce a striking oxymoron.[48]—<span class="greekheb">οὓτως</span>, <span class="ital">so</span>) as the stars, <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>.

Its position in the Authorized Version might suggest its dependence on "believed," which is grammatically possible (cf. <a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>), but unallowable here, since hope cannot well be regarded as the <span class="accented">object</span> of belief) <span class="cmt_word">to the end he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be</span> (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, viz.

With regard to the construction of ver. 20, we may observe that, though in the Authorized Version, which is followed above, the prepositions put before "unbelief" and "faith" are varied, both words are datives without a preposition in the Greek, and apparently with the same force of the dative in both cases, the sense being, "With regard to the promise, etc., <span class="accented">unbelief</span> did not cause him to waver (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">, but faith</span> made him strong <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." The purport of the whole passage is to show, with reference to <a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-22</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-16</a>, how Abraham's faith in the promise of a seed through Sarah, which seemed impossible in the natural course of things, corresponded in essence to our faith in "him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead" (ver. 24). It was faith in a Divine power above nature, able to quicken into supernatural life that which humanly is dead. And as Abraham's faith in this promised birth of Isaac involved a further faith in the fulfilment through him of all the promises, so our faith in the resurrection of Christ involves faith in all that is signified and assured to us thereby - in "the power of a Divine life" in him, to bring life out of death, to regenerate and quicken the spiritually dead, and finally in "eternal redemption" and the "restitution of all things" (cf. <a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>; <a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18-23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-8</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; to which many other similarly significant passages might be added). It may be observed that, not only in the instance here adduced, but in his whole life as recorded in Genesis, Abraham stands forth as an exemplification of habitual faith in a Divine order beyond sight, and trust in Divine promises. In this consists the religious meaning of that record for us all. Notably so (as is especially set forth in <a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a>, etc.) in his willingness to sacrifice the son through whom the promise was to be fulfilled, retaining still his faith in the fulfilment. </body></html>
