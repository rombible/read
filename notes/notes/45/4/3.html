Abraham was not justified by works, and therefore had nothing to boast of in God’s sight. He was justified by faith. His righteousness was not real, but imputed. His faith was treated as if it had been equivalent to a righteousness of works. It met with the same acceptance in the sight of God that a righteousness of works would have done. But—the argument goes on—faith carries with it no such idea of merit or debt as works. It is met by a pure act of grace on the part of God.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham believed God.</span>—The quotation is taken from <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>, where it appears as a comment upon Abraham’s belief in the promise that he should have a numerous posterity. The same passage is elaborately commented upon by Philo and others, so that it would seem to have been a common topic in the Jewish schools. It should be noticed that the word “faith” is not used in quite the same sense in the original and in the application. In Abraham’s case it was trust in the fulfilment of the divine promise, in St. Paul’s sense it is rather enthusiastic adhesion to a person. This is part of the general enlargement and deepening of the Old Testament terminology by St. Paul. A writer of less profundity (though marked by striking and elevated qualities), the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, applies the word more strictly. (See <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) In <a href="/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a> the word has the still thinner meaning of a merely intellectual assent. St Paul quotes the same passage in the same sense as here in <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">It was counted unto him.</span>—It should be observed that the same words are translated by the Authorised version here, “it was <span class= "ital">counted unto</span> him;” in <a href="/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a>, “faith was <span class= "ital">reckoned to</span> Abraham;” in <a href="/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>, “it was <span class= "ital">imputed unto</span> him;” in <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>, “it was <span class= "ital">accounted to</span> him;” in <a href="/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a>, “it was <span class= "ital">imputed to</span> him.” A defect in the translation, which, however, hardly obscures the true meaning.<p>The sense of imputation is not to be got rid of. It is distinctly a forensic act. The righteousness attributed to Abraham is not an actual righteousness, but something else that is considered and treated as if it were equivalent to such righteousness. It is so treated by God acting as the judge of men. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus E: On the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and Imputed Righteousness.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/romans/4-3.htm" title="For what said the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:3</a>. </span><span class="ital">For what saith the Scripture? </span>— What is Moses’s account of this matter? <span class="ital">Abraham believed God </span>— Namely, that promise of God, recorded <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>, that he should have a seed numerous as the stars. As also the promise concerning Christ, mentioned <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, through whom all nations should be blessed. “The apostle mentions only this one instance of Abraham’s faith, because Moses had said of it in particular, that it was counted to him for righteousness. But we must not, on that account, think it the only act of faith that was so counted to him. He had an habitual disposition to believe and obey God, founded on just conceptions of his being and attributes. And he began to exercise it when God first called him to leave his native country. For <span class="ital">by faith he went out, not knowing whither he went, </span><a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a>. The same faith he exercised through the whole course of his life; acting on every occasion as one will do whose mind is filled with a present sense of Deity. Of this the instance mentioned by the apostle is a great example. For, in the eightieth year of his age, when Sarah was seventy years old, he believed what God told him concerning the numerousness of his seed, though it was at that time contrary to the ordinary course of nature: nay, he continued to believe it from that time forth, for the space of twenty years, during which no child was given him: see on <a href="/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>. At length, in the hundredth year of his age, the son so long promised was born. But mark what happened! When this son, to whom all the promises were limited, became fourteen years old, God commanded Abraham to offer him up as a burnt-offering; and he, without hesitation, obeyed; firmly believing that, after he was burnt to ashes on the altar, God would raise him from the dead, <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm" title="Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from where also he received him in a figure.">Hebrews 11:19</a>. By this and other instances, Abraham became so remarkable for his faith, that God, by a covenant, constituted him the father of all believers.” <span class="ital">And it was counted to him for righteousness </span>— So our translators have very properly rendered the Greek phrase here, and <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>, for the original word, <span class="greekheb">ελογισθη</span>, signifies <span class="ital">to state, </span>and <span class="ital">sum up an account; </span>also, <span class="ital">to put a value upon a thing, </span><a href="/romans/8-18.htm" title="For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.">Romans 8:18</a>. The word <span class="ital">count </span>includes both meanings. The sense is, God accepted Abraham as if he had been altogether righteous: or, this his faith was accounted by God his gospel righteousness, as being the performance of the condition the gospel requires, in order to justification. See on <a href="/romans/3-28.htm" title="Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.">Romans 3:28</a>. “But neither here, nor <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>, is it said that <span class="ital">Christ’s righteousness </span>was counted to Abraham. In both passages, the expression is, <span class="ital">Abraham believed God, and it, </span>namely, his believing God, <span class="ital">was counted to him for righteousness; </span>and <a href="/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a>, of this chapter, <span class="ital">we say that faith was counted to him for righteousness: </span>so also <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>. Further, as it is nowhere said in Scripture that Christ’s righteousness was imputed to Abraham, so neither is it said anywhere that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers. In short, the uniform doctrine of the Scripture is, that the believer’s <span class="ital">faith is counted to him for righteousness, </span>by the mere grace or favour of God, through Jesus Christ; that is, on account of what Christ hath done to procure that favour for them. This is very different from the doctrine of those who hold that by having faith imputed, or accounted for righteousness, the believer becomes <span class="ital">perfectly righteous; </span>whether they mean thereby that faith is itself a perfect righteousness, or that it is the instrument of conveying to the believer the perfect righteousness of another. With respect to the first, it is not true that faith is a perfect righteousness; for if it were, justification would not be <span class="ital">a free gift, </span>but a <span class="ital">debt. </span>And with respect to the second supposition, although the perfect righteousness of another were conveyed to a sinner by faith, it would not make him perfectly righteous; because it is beyond the power of Omnipotence itself, by any means whatever, to make a person not to have sinned, who actually hath sinned. And yet, unless this is done, no believer can be perfectly righteous. On account of the perfect righteousness of another, God indeed may treat one as if he were perfectly righteous. But that is all. Nor does the Scripture carry the matter further.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For what saith the Scripture? - The inspired account of Abraham's justification. This account was final, and was to settle the question. This account is found in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>.<p>Abraham believed God - In the Hebrew, "Abraham believed Yahweh." The sense is substantially the same, as the argument turns on the act of believing. The faith which Abraham exercised was, that his posterity should be like the stars of heaven in number. This promise was made to him when he had no child, and of course when he had no prospect of such a posterity. See the strength and nature of this faith further illustrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16-21</a>. The reason why it was counted to him for righteousness was, that it was such a strong, direct, and unwavering act of confidence in the promise of God.<p>And it - The word "it" here evidently refers to the act of believing It does not refer to the righteousness of another - of God, or of the Messiah; but the discussion is solely of the strong act of Abraham's faith. which in some sense was counted to him for righteousness. In what sense this was, is explained directly after. All that is material to remark here is, that the act of Abraham, the strong confidence of his mind in the promises of God, his unwavering assurance that what God had promised he would perform, was reckoned for righteousness. The same thing is more fully expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18-22</a>. When therefore it is said that the righteousness of Christ is accounted or imputed to us; when it is said that his merits are transferred and reckoned as ours; whatever may be the truth of the doctrine, it cannot be defended by "this" passage of Scripture.<p>Faith is uniformly an act of the mind. It is not a created essence which is placed within the mind. It is not a substance created independently of the soul, and placed within it by almighty power. It is not a principle, for the expression a principle of faith, is as unmeaningful as a principle of joy, or a principle of sorrow, or a principle of remorse. God promises; the man believes; and this is the whole of it.<p>(A principle is the "element or original cause," out of which certain consequences arise, and to which they may be traced. And if faith be the root of all acceptable obedience, then certainly, in this sense, it is a principle. But whatever faith be, it is not here asserted that it is imputed for, or instead of, righteousness. See the note above.)<p>While the word "faith" is sometimes used to denote religious doctrine, or the system that is to be believed (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>; <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/10-8.htm">Romans 10:8</a>; <a href="/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>, etc.); yet, when it is used to denote that which is required of people, it always denotes an acting of the mind exercised in relation to some object, or some promise, or threatening, or declaration of some other being; see the note at <a href="/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>.<p>Was counted - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;  elogigisthe&#772;. The same word in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-22.htm">Romans 4:22</a>, is is rendered "it was imputed." The word occurs frequently in the Scriptures. In the Old Testament, the verb &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;  chaashab, which which is translated by the word &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  logizomai, means literally, "to think, to intend," or "purpose; to imagine, invent," or "devise; to reckon," or "account; to esteem; to impute," that is, to impute to a man what belongs to himself, or what "ought" to be imputed to him. It occurs only in the following places: <a href="/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>; <a href="/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>; <a href="/job/33-10.htm">Job 33:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-15.htm">Genesis 38:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/52-4.htm">Psalm 52:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a>; <a href="/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-27.htm">Numbers 18:27</a>, <a href="/numbers/18-30.htm">Numbers 18:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-16.htm">Genesis 31:16</a>. I have examined all the passages, and as the result of my examination have come to the conclusion, that there is not one in which the word is used in the sense of reckoning or imputing to a man what does not strictly belong to him; or of charging on him what ought not to be charged on him as a matter of personal right. The word is never used to denote imputing in the sense of transferring, or of charging that on one which does not properly belong to him. The same is the case in the New Testament. The word occurs about forty times (see "Schmidius' Concord)," and, in a similar signification. No doctrine of transferring, or of setting over to a man what does not properly belong to him, be it sin or holiness, can be derived, therefore, from this word. Whatever is meant by it here, it evidently is declared that the act of believing is what is intended, both by Moses and by Paul.<p>For righteousness - In order to justification; or to regard and treat him in connection with this as a righteous man; as one who was admitted to the favor and friendship of God. In reference to this we may remark,<p>(1) That it is evidently not intended that the act of believing, on the part of Abraham, was the meritorious ground of acceptance; for then it would have been a work. Faith was as much his own act, as any act of obedience to the Law.<p>(2) the design of the apostle was to show that by the Law, or by works, man could not be justified; <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a>.<p>(3) faith was not what the Law required. It demanded complete and perfect obedience; and if a man was justified by faith, it was in some other way than by the Law.<p>(4) as the Law did not demand this; and as faith was something different from the demand of the Law; so if a man were justified by that, it was on a principle altogether different from justification by works. It was not by personal merit. It was not by complying with the Law. It was in a mode entirely different.<p>(5) in being justified by faith, it is meant, therefore, that we are treated as righteous; that we are forgiven; that we are admitted to the favor of God, and treated as his friends.<p>(6) in this act, faith, is a mere instrument, an antecedent, a "sine qua non," what God has been pleased to appoint as a condition on which men may be treated as righteous. It expresses a state of mind which is demonstrative of love to God; of affection for his cause and character; of reconciliation and friendship; and is therefore that state to which he has been graciously pleased to promise pardon and acceptance.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. For what saith the, Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it&#8212;his faith.<p>was counted to him for righteousness&#8212;(Ge 15:6). Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter of the apostle's teaching. Throughout this whole argument, faith is set in direct opposition to works, in the matter of justification&#8212;and even in Ro 4:4, 5. The meaning, therefore, cannot possibly be that the mere act of believing&#8212;which is as much a work as any other piece of commanded duty (Joh 6:29; 1Jo 3:23)&#8212;was counted to Abraham for all obedience. The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ (Ge 12:3; 15:5, &c.), as we believe in Christ Himself; and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The scripture referred to is in <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a></span>.

Our adversaries the papists oppose the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to us; they cavil at the very word, and call it putative righteousness: and yet the apostle useth the word ten times in this chapter, and in the same sense that word ten times in this chapter, and in the same sense that we take it. But how shall we reconcile our apostle with St. James, about the manner of Abraham’s justification: he says expressly, <span class="bld"><a href="/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a></span>, that <span class="ital">Abraham our father was justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac; </span> and thence he infers, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a></span>, that <span class="ital">by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span> They are easily reconciled, forasmuch as the one discourseth of the cause of our justification before God; the other, of the signs of justification before men. The one speaks of the imputation of righteousness; the other, of the declaration of righteousness. The one speaks of the office of faith; the other, of the quality of faith. The one speaks of the justification of the person; the other, of the faith of that person.

This answers to  "what is that which is written" (c)? or what does the Scripture say? which is a way of speaking used by the Jews, when anything is proposed, which seems contrary to Scripture, as here justification by works does. A testimony from Scripture is here produced, proving that Abraham was justified by faith, and not by works: the place referred to is <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <p>Abraham believed God; the object of his faith and trust were not his riches, nor his righteousness, but Jehovah, the Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, styled in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, "the Word of the Lord", the essential Word of God, and called his "shield", and "exceeding great reward"; characters which are very applicable to Christ: and this faith of his in the Lord was not a mere assent to the promise of God, but a fiducial act of faith in him; and was not merely concerned with temporal, but with spiritual things, and particularly about Christ the promised seed: <p>and it was counted to him for righteousness, the meaning of which is not, that Abraham imputed righteousness to God, or celebrated his righteousness and faithfulness, as some; or that the world reckoned Abraham a righteous person, as others; but that God reckoned him righteous, or imputed it to him for righteousness: and the question is, what the it is which was counted to him for righteousness? and that this is to be understood, , "concerning faith", as R. Solomon Jarchi says, is out of question; for this is expressly said by the apostle, <a href="/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9</a>. The only one is, whether it means the grace of faith by which he believed; or the object of faith on which he believed, and with which his faith was conversant: not the former, for that is not righteousness, nor accounted so; but is distinguished from it, and is that by which a person receives and lays hold on righteousness; besides, whatever may be alleged in favour of the imputation of Abraham's faith to himself for righteousness, it can never be thought to be imputed to others on that account; whereas the very selfsame it is imputed to others also; see <a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>; it remains then that it was the promised seed, the Messiah, and his righteousness, which Abraham, by faith, looked unto, and believed in, that was made unto him righteousness by imputation. Now since so great and good a man as Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith in the righteousness of the Messiah, it follows, that none of his sons, nor any other person whatever, ought to seek for, or expect to be justified in any other way. <p>(c) T.

Tholuck, because the promise was a promise of grace, comes merely to the unsatisfactory view of “a <span class="ital">virtual parallel also</span> with the object of the justifying faith of Christians.” Still less (in opposition to Neander and others) can the explanation of the subjective nature of faith in general, without the addition of its specific <span class="ital">object</span> (Christ), suffice for the conception of Abraham as the father of all believing in <span class="ital">Christ</span>; since in that case there would only have been present in him a pre-formation of faith as respects its psychological quality generally, and not also in respect of its <span class="ital">subject-matter</span>, which is nevertheless the specific and distinguishing point in the case of justifying faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may add that our passage, since it expresses not a (mediate) <span class="ital">issuing</span> of righteousness from faith, but the <span class="ital">imputation</span> of the latter, serves as a proof of justification being an <span class="ital">actus forensis;</span> and what the Catholic expositors (including even Reithmayr and Maier) advance to the contrary is a pure subjective addition to the text.[975] It is well said by Erasmus: that is <span class="ital">imputed</span>, “quod re persolutum non est, sed tamen <span class="ital">ex imputantis benignitate</span> pro soluto <span class="ital">habetur</span>.” Comp also Philippi <span class="ital">in loc</span>[977], and Hoelemann, <span class="ital">de justitiae ex fide ambabus in V.

There the (supposed) Gentile who keeps the law, is treated as if he were circumcised, <span class="ital">though he is not</span>. Here Abraham, because he believes, is treated as having personal (justifying) righteousness, <span class="ital">though he has it not</span>. In other words, he is justified on a ground which is <span class="ital">not his own works</span>. It is specially needful to notice (what this particular passage brings out) that faith is in no sense regarded as, <span class="ital">in itself, righteousness</span>. (See below, on <a href="/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>.) The statement is that, “by grace,” the same result, viz. acceptance before God, follows faith that would follow the possession of merit. Faith is the condition, but not the ground, of this acceptance. The ground is the Propitiation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[In <a href="/psalms/106-31.htm" title="And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever more.">Psalm 106:31</a> we have the very words used of Phinehas which are here used of Abraham.

In Phinehas, an act of holy zeal was honoured by a special temporal favour, the permanence of the priesthood in his family. It was no question of <span class="ital">acceptance in respect of salvation;</span> a matter which lies on a totally different level from that of temporal rewards. On that lower level, the act of Phinehas <span class="ital">was</span> one of merit, and was “reckoned” as such to him and his house. In Abraham’s case we have two notes of difference from that of Phinehas: (1) faith in God, not an act of zeal, is the occasion; (2) the “imputation” is mentioned absolutely and with peculiar solemnity, unconnected with any temporal results.
