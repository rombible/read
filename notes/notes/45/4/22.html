It points at Christ, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And therefore - His faith was so implicit, and so unwavering, that it was a demonstration that he was the firm friend of God. He was tried, and he had such confidence in God that he showed that he was supremely attached to him, and would obey and serve him. This was reckoned as a full proof of friendship; and he was recognised and treated as righteous; that is, as the friend of God. (The true sense of faith being imputed for righteousness is given in a note at the beginning of the chapter.)

Not because his faith was strong, and he had a full assurance of it, but because it was right, resting on the promise of God, and relying upon his power and faithfulness to perform it; for though the righteousness of faith is not imputed to any sort of believers, not to mere nominal ones, yet to all such as have true faith, though it may be but weak; for faith, as to nature, kind, and object, though not as to degree, is the same in all true believers, and the same righteousness is imputed to one as to another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>.

The spiritual attitude of a man, who is conscious that in himself he has no strength, and no hope of a future, and who nevertheless casts himself, upon, and lives by, the word of God which assures him of a future, is the necessarily and eternally right attitude of all souls to God. He whose attitude it is, is at bottom right with God. Now this was the attitude of Abraham to God, and it is the attitude of all sinners who believe in God through Christ; and to him and them alike it is reckoned by God for righteousness. The Gospel does not subvert the religious order under which Abraham lived; it illustrates, extends, and confirms it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">And therefore</span>, &c.] This quality of faith <span class="ital">accounts</span> for its imputation in justification.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὸ</span>, <span class="ital">therefore</span>) namely, because he gave glory to GOD.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore also it was reckoned to him for righteousness.
