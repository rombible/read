Now, the death which passed over mankind had its origin in Adam’s sin. Strictly speaking, there could be no individual sin till there was a law to be broken. But in the interval between Adam and Moses, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> before the institution of law, death prevailed, over the world. which was a proof that there was sin somewhere. The solution is, that the sin in question was not the individual guilt of individual transgressors, but the single transgression of Adam. Here, then, is the contrast. The single sin of the one man, Adam, brought death upon all mankind; the single act of the one Redeemer cleared away many offences—also for all men. Under the old dispensation law entered in to intensify the evil; but, in like manner, under the new, grace has come in to enhance and multiply the benefit. Thus the remedial system and the condemnatory system are co-extensive, the one over against the other, and the first entirely cancels the second.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Wherefore.</span>—The train of thought which follows is suggested by the mention which had just been made of atonement, reconciliation. We see here another instance of the Apostle’s fondness for transcendental theology, and for the development of the deeper mysteries of God’s dealings with man. The rapidity with which ideas of this kind throng into his brain is such as to break the even flow and structure of his sentence.<p><span class= "bld">As by one man.</span>—This clause, “As by one man sin and death entered,” ought to have been answered by “So by one Man grace and life entered.” But a difficulty occurs at the very outset. How can it really be said that sin and death entered by Adam? For sin does not exist without law, and the law did not come in till Moses. And yet we have proof that sin must have been there; for death, its consequence, prevailed all through this period in which law was still wanting. The fact was, the sin which then prevailed, and had such wide and disastrous effects, was Adam’s. So that it is strictly legitimate to compare his fall with the act of redemption. It is strictly true to say that by one man sin and death entered into the world, as life and grace entered by another. In either case the consequence was that of one man’s act.<p><span class= "bld">For that all have sinned.</span>—.Rather, <span class= "ital">for that,</span> or <span class= "ital">because, all sinned</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> not by their own individual act, but implicitly in Adam’s transgression. They were summed up, and included in him as the head and representative of the race.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:...">Romans 5:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— This refers to all the preceding discourse, from which the apostle infers what follows: he does not therefore make a digression, but returns to speak again of sin and righteousness; as if he had said, “We may from these premises infer, that the benefit which we believers receive from Christ is equal to the detriment we derive from Adam; yea, is on the whole greater than that.” For, <span class="ital">as by one man </span>— That is, Adam, the common father of the human species; (he is mentioned, and not Eve, as being the representative of mankind;) <span class="ital">sin entered into the world </span>— Actual sin, namely, the transgression of Adam and its consequence, a sinful nature, which took place in him, through his first sin, and which he conveyed to all his posterity; <span class="ital">and death </span>— With all its attendants. It entered into the world when it entered into being; for till then it did not exist; <span class="ital">by sin </span>— Therefore it could not enter in before sin; <span class="ital">and so</span> — Namely, by one man; <span class="ital">death passed </span>— From one generation to another; <span class="ital">upon all men, for that all have sinned — </span>Namely, in Adam, their representative, and as being in his loins. That is, they are so far involved in his first transgression and its consequences, and so certainly derive a sinful nature from him, that they become obnoxious to death. Instead of, <span class="ital">for that, </span>Dr. Doddridge renders <span class="greekheb">εφ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ω</span>, <span class="ital">unto which, </span>(namely, unto death, mentioned in the preceding clause,) <span class="ital">all have sinned. </span>In which ever way the expression is rendered, the words are evidently intended to assign the reason why death came upon all men, infants themselves not excepted. <span class="ital">For until the law </span>— For, from the fall of Adam, unto the time when God gave the law by Moses, as well as after it; <span class="ital">sin was in the world </span>— As appeared by the continual execution of its punishment; that is, death: <span class="ital">but </span>— It is a self- evident principle that <span class="ital">sin is not, </span>and cannot be, <span class="ital">imputed where there is no law </span>— Since the very essence of sin consists in the violation of a law. And consequently, since we see, in fact, that sin was imputed, we must conclude that the persons, to whose account it was charged, were under some law. Now this, with respect to infants, could not be the law of nature, (any more than the law of Moses,) for infants could not transgress that; it must therefore have been the law given to Adam, the transgression whereof is, in some sense, imputed to all, even to infants, he being the representative of all his posterity, and they all being in his loins. In other words, they do not die for any actual sins of their own, being incapable, while in infancy, of committing any, but through Adam’s sin alone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-14 The design of what follows is plain. It is to exalt our views respecting the blessings Christ has procured for us, by comparing them with the evil which followed upon the fall of our first father; and by showing that these blessings not only extend to the removal of these evils, but far beyond. Adam sinning, his nature became guilty and corrupted, and so came to his children. Thus in him all have sinned. And death is by sin; for death is the wages of sin. Then entered all that misery which is the due desert of sin; temporal, spiritual, eternal death. If Adam had not sinned, he had not died; but a sentence of death was passed, as upon a criminal; it passed through all men, as an infectious disease that none escape. In proof of our union with Adam, and our part in his first transgression, observe, that sin prevailed in the world, for many ages before the giving of the law by Moses. And death reigned in that long time, not only over adults who wilfully sinned, but also over multitudes of infants, which shows that they had fallen in Adam under condemnation, and that the sin of Adam extended to all his posterity. He was a figure or type of Him that was to come as Surety of a new covenant, for all who are related to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a> has been usually regarded as the most difficult part of the New Testament. It is not the design of these notes to enter into a minute criticism of contested points like this. They who wish to see a full discussion of the passage, may find it in the professedly critical commentaries; and especially in the commentaries of Tholuck and of Professor Stuart on the Romans. The meaning of the passage in its general bearing is not difficult; and probably the whole passage would have been found far less difficult if it had not been attached to a philosophical theory on the subject of man's sin, and if a strenuous and indefatigable effort had not been made to prove that it teaches what it was never designed to teach. The plain and obvious design of the passage is this, to show one of the benefits of the doctrine of justification by faith. The apostle had shown,<p>(1) That that doctrine produced peace, <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>.<p>(2) That it produces joy in the prospect of future glory, <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>.<p>(3) That it sustained the soul in afflictions;<p>(a) by the regular tendency of afflictions under the gospel, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-4</a>; and,<p>(b) by the fact that the Holy Spirit was imparted to the believer.<p>(4) That this doctrine rendered it certain that we should be saved, because Christ had died for us, <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>; because this was the highest expression of love, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm">Romans 5:7-8</a>; and because if we had been reconciled when thus alienated, we should be saved now that we are the friends of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9-10</a>.<p>(5) That it led us to rejoice in God himself; produced joy in his presence, and in all his attributes.<p>He now proceeds to show the bearing on that great mass of evil which had been introduced into the world by sin, and to prove that the benefits of the atonement were far greater than the evils which had been introduced by the acknowledged effects of the sin of Adam. "The design is to exalt our views of the work of Christ, and of the plan of justification through him, by comparing them with the evil consequences of the sin of our first father, and by showing that the blessings in question not only extend to the removal of these evils, but far beyond this, so that the grace of the gospel has not only abounded, but superabounded." (Prof. Stuart.) In doing this, the apostle admits, as an undoubted and well-understood fact:<p>1. That sin came into the world by one man, and death as the consequence. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>.<p>2. That death had passed on all; even on those who had not the light of revelation, and the express commands of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13-14</a>.<p>3. That Adam was the figure, the type of him that was to come; that there was some sort of analogy or resemblance between the results of his act and the results of the work of Christ. That analogy consisted in the fact that the effects of his doings did not terminate on himself, but extended to numberless other persons, and that it was thus with the work of Christ, <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>. But he shows,<p>4. That there were very material and important differences in the two cases. There was not a perfect parallelism. The effects of the work of Christ were far more than simply to counteract the evil introduced by the sin of Adam. The differences between the effect of his act and the work of Christ are these.<p>(1) The sin of Adam led to condemnation. The work of Christ has an opposite tendency, <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ro 5:12-21. Comparison and Contrast between Adam and Christ in Their Relation to the Human Family.<p>(This profound and most weighty section has occasioned an immense deal of critical and theological discussion, in which every point, and almost every clause, has been contested. We can here but set down what appears to us to be the only tenable view of it as a whole and of its successive clauses, with some slight indication of the grounds of our judgment).<p>12. Wherefore&#8212;that is, Things being so; referring back to the whole preceding argument.<p>as by one man&#8212;Adam.<p>sin&#8212;considered here in its guilt, criminality, penal desert.<p>entered into the world, and death by sin&#8212;as the penalty of sin.<p>and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned&#8212;rather, "all sinned," that is, in that one man's first sin. Thus death reaches every individual of the human family, as the penalty due to himself. (So, in substance, Bengel, Hodge, Philippi). Here we should have expected the apostle to finish his sentence, in some such way as this: "Even so, by one man righteousness has entered into the world, and life by righteousness." But, instead of this, we have a digression, extending to five verses, to illustrate the important statement of Ro 5:12; and it is only at Ro 5:18 that the comparison is resumed and finished.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> From this verse to the end of the chapter, the apostle makes a large comparison between the first and Second Adam, which he joins to what he had said by the causal particle <span class="ital">wherefore:</span> q.d. Seeing things are as I have already said, it is evident, that what was lost by Adam is restored by Christ. This verse seems to be lame and imperfect; the reddition is wanting in the comparison; for unto this, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as by one man sin entered into the world, </span> there should be added, so by Christ, &c. But the reddition, or second part of the comparison, is suspended, by reason of a long parenthesis intervening to <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/5-18.htm" title="Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came on all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came on all men to justification of life.">Romans 5:18</a>,19</span>, where the apostle sets down both parts of the comparison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By one man:</span> viz.

The design of these words, and of the following, is to show how men came to be in the condition before described, as "ungodly", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>, "sinners", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, and "enemies", <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; and to express the love of Christ in the redemption of them; and the largeness of God's grace to all sorts of men: the connection of them is with <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>, by which it appears that the saints have not only an expiation of sin by the blood of Christ, but a perfect righteousness, by which they are justified in the sight of God; and the manner how they came at it, or this becomes theirs, together with the necessity of their having such an one, are here declared: by the "one man" is meant Adam the first man, and parent of mankind, who is mentioned by name in <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>; sin which came by him designs a single sin, and not many, even the first sin of Adam, which goes by different names, as "sin" here, "transgression", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>, the "offence" or "fall", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, "disobedience", <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>, and whatever was the first step or motive to it, which led to it, whether pride, unbelief, or concupiscence, it was finished by eating the forbidden fruit; and is called sin emphatically, because it contained all sin in it, was attended with aggravating circumstances, and followed with dismal consequences. Hence may be learnt the origin of moral evil among men, which comes not from God, but man; of this it is said, that it "entered into the world"; not the world above, there sin entered by the devil; but the world below, and it first entered into paradise, and then passed through the whole world; it entered into men by the snares of Satan, and by him it enters into all the inhabitants of the world; into all men that descend from him by ordinary generation, and that so powerfully that there is no stopping of it. It has entered by him, not by imitation, for it has entered into such as never sinned after the similitude of his transgression, infants, or otherwise death could not have entered into them, and into such who never heard of it, as the Heathens; besides, sin entered as death did, which was not by imitation but imputation, for all men are reckoned dead in Adam, being accounted sinners in him; add to this, that in the same way Christ's righteousness comes upon us, which is by imputation, Adam's sin enters into us, or becomes ours; upon which death follows, <p>and death by sin; that is, death has entered into the world of men by sin, by the first sin of the first man; not only corporeal death, but a spiritual or moral one, man, in consequence of this, becoming "dead in sin", deprived of righteousness, and averse, and impotent to all that is good; and also an eternal death, to which he is liable; for "the wages of sin is death", <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; even eternal death: all mankind are in a legal sense dead, the sentence of condemnation and death immediately passed on Adam as soon as he had sinned, and upon all his posterity; <p>and so death passed upon all men; the reason of which was, <p>for that, or because "in him" <p>all have sinned: all men were naturally and seminally in him; as he was the common parent of mankind, he had all human nature in him, and was also the covenant head, and representative of all his posterity; so that they were in him both naturally and federally, and so "sinned in him"; and fell with him by his first transgression into condemnation and death. The ancient Jews, and some of the modern ones, have said many things agreeably to the apostle's doctrine of original sin; they own the imputation of the guilt of Adam's sin to his posterity to condemnation and death; <p>"through the sin of the first man (say they (g)) , "thou art dead"; for he brought death into the world:'' <p>nothing is more frequently said by them than that Adam and Eve, through the evil counsel of the serpent,    , "were the cause of death to themselves and to all the world" (h); and that through the eating of the fruit of the tree,   , "all the inhabitants of the earth became guilty of death" (i): and that this was not merely a corporeal death, they gather from the doubling of the word in the threatening, "in dying thou shalt die", <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> (margin); <p>"this doubled death, say they (k), without doubt is the punishment of their body by itself,  , and also of the "soul by itself".'' <p>They speak of some righteous persons who died, not for any sin of their own, but purely on the account of Adam's sin; as Benjamin the son of Jacob, Amram the father of Moses, and Jesse the father of David, and Chileab the son of David (l), to these may be added Joshua the son of Nun, and Zelophehad and Levi: the corruption and pollution of human nature through the sin of Adam is clearly expressed by them; <p>"when Adam sinned, (say they (m),) he "drew upon him a defiled power,    , "and defiled himself and all the people of the "world".'' <p>Again (n), <p>"this vitiosity which comes from the sin and infection of our first parents, has invaded both faculties of the rational soul, the understanding by which we apprehend, and the will by which we desire.'' <p>This corruption of nature they call , "the evil imagination", which, they say (o), is planted in a man's heart at the time of his birth; and others say (p) that it is in him before he is born: hence Philo the Jew says (q), that   , "to sin is connatural", to every man that is born, even though a good man; and talks (r) of , "evil that is born with us", and of (s) , "spots that are of necessity born with" every mortal man. And so his countrymen (t) often speak of it as natural and inseparable to men; yea, they represent Adam as the root and head of mankind, in whom the whole world and all human nature sinned: descanting on those words, "as one that lieth upon the top of a mast", <a href="/proverbs/23-34.htm">Proverbs 23:34</a>; <p>"this (say they (u)) is the first man who was    "an head to all the children of men": for by means of wine death was inflicted on him, and he was the cause of bringing the sorrows of death into the world.'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Wherefore, as by <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> one man <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> for that all have sinned:</span><p>(10) From Adam, in whom all have sinned, both guiltiness and death (which is the punishment of the guiltiness) came upon all.<p>(l) By Adam, who is compared with Christ, and similar to him in this, that both of them make those who are theirs partakers of that which they have: but they are not the same in this, that Adam derives sin into them that are his, even into their very nature, and that to death: but Christ makes them that are his partakers of his righteousness by grace, and that to life.<p>(m) By sin is meant that disease which is ours by inheritance, and men commonly call it original sin: for so he calls that sin in the singular number, whereas if he speaks of the fruits of it, he uses the plural number, calling them sins.<p>(n) That is, in Adam.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>.[1228] <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="ital">Therefore</span>, because, namely, we have received through Christ the <span class="greekheb">καταλλαγή</span> and the assurance of eternal salvation, <a href="/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>.

According to Rückert, Fritzsche (in his commentary), and de Wette, Paul has come, after <a href="/context/romans/5-13.htm" title="(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law....">Romans 5:13-14</a>, to reflect that the comparison begun involved not merely <span class="ital">agreement</span> but also <span class="ital">discrepancy</span>, and has accordingly turned aside from the apodosis, which must necessarily have expressed the equivalence, and inserted instead of it the opposition in <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift.

This view is at variance with the entire character of the section, which indeed bears quite especially the stamp of most careful and acute premeditation, but shows no signs of Paul’s having been led in the progress of his thought to the opposite of what he had started with. According to Mehring, <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift.

Against this view may be urged not only the unprecedented length, but still more the contents of the supposed parenthesis, which in fact already comprehends in itself the parallel under every aspect.

This much applies also against Olshausen and Ewald. Others again have held that <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a> contains the protasis and the apodosis completely, taking the latter to begin <span class="ital">either</span> with <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕτως</span> (Clericus, Wolf, Glöckler), or even with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΔΙΆ</span></span></span> (Erasmus, Beza, Benecke), both of which views however are at variance with the parallel between Adam and Christ which rules the whole of what follows, and are thus in the light of the connection erroneous, although the former by no means required a trajection (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὝΤΩς</span></span></span> for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὝΤΩ ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>).

The treatment of the righteousness of God, as a Divine gift to sinners in Jesus Christ, is now complete, and the Apostle might have passed on to his treatment of the new life (chaps. 6–8). But he introduces at this point a digression in which a comparison—which in most points is rather a contrast—is made between Adam and Christ. Up to this point he has spoken of Christ alone, and the truth of what he has said rests upon its own evidence; it is not affected in the least by any difficulty we may have in adapting what he says of Adam to our knowledge or ignorance of human origins. The general truth he teaches here is that there is a real unity of the human race, on the one hand in sin and death, on the other in righteousness and life; in the former aspect the race is summed up in Adam; in the latter, in Christ. It is a distinction, apparently, between the two, that the unity in Adam is natural, having a physical basis in the organic connection of all men through all generations; whereas the unity in Christ is spiritual, being dependent upon faith. Yet this distinction is not specially in view in the passage, which rather treats Adam and Christ in an objective way, the transition (morally) from Adam’s doom to that of man being only mediated by the words <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἥμαρτον</span> in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>, and the connection between Christ and the new humanity by <span class="greekheb">οἱ τὴν περισσείαν τῆς χάριτος λαμβάνοντες</span> in vet. 17.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12–21</span>.

Without explaining (what cannot be explained, perhaps, in this life,) the <span class="ital">reason</span> of the thing, it states as a <span class="ital">fact</span> concerning the Fall that its result is not only inherited sinfulness, but inherited guilt; i.e. liability to punishment, (that of <span class="ital">death</span>,) on account of the primeval Sin. <span class="ital">Death</span> (in human beings) <span class="ital">is penalty:</span> but e.g. infants, void of actual moral wrong, die: therefore they die for inherited (we may say for vicarious) guilt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. From this admitted mystery and fact (as plainly it was with the Romans) St Paul argues to the corresponding “life” of believers in virtue of the vicarious righteousness of Messiah, whom here (and in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-47.htm" title="The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>,) he regards as the Second Adam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5.

In imitation of Paul’s method, we must treat, in the first place, of actual sin, according to the first and following chapters, and then go back to the source in which sin originated. Paul does not speak altogether expressly of that which theologians call original sin; but, in truth the sin of Adam is sufficient to demonstrate man’s guilt; the very many, and most mournful fruits resulting from it, are sufficient for the demonstration of man’s habitual corruption. And man, in consequence of justification, at length looks back upon, and apprehends the doctrine concerning the origin of evil, and the other things connected with it.

Ans. 1. Adam had received the commandment. 2. He was not only the Head of his race, but also of Eve. 3. If Adam had not listened to the voice of his wife, not more than one would have sinned. Moreover, why is nothing said of Satan, who is the primary cause of sin? Ans. 1. Satan is opposed to God; Adam to Christ; moreover, here the economy of grace is described as it belongs to Christ, rather than as it belongs to God: therefore, God is once mentioned, <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>; Satan is never mentioned. 2.

The question is not about the particular sin of individuals; but in the sin of Adam all have sinned, as all died in the death of Christ for their salvation, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>.

The serpent and Eve made the day of death rush suddenly upon man and upon all the inhabitants of the earth. Sin precedes death; but the universality of death becomes known earlier than the universality of sin. This plan of arrangement is adopted with respect to the four clauses in this verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-21.</span> - (b) From consideration of the blessed effects on believers of faith in the reconciliation through Christ, the apostle now passes to <span class="accented">the effects of that reconciliation as the position of the whole human race before God.</span> His drift is that the reconciliation corresponds to the original transgression; both proceeded from <span class="accented">one</span>, and both include all mankind in their results; as the one introduced <span class="accented">sin</span> into the world, and, as its consequence, <span class="accented">death</span>, so the other introduced <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, and, as its consequence, <span class="accented">life</span>. It may be observed that in ch. 1 also he has in one sense traced sin backward through the past ages, so as to show how all mankind had come to be under condemnation for it. But the subject was regarded from a different point of view, the purpose of the argument being also different. There he was addressing the heathen world, his purpose being to convince the whole of it of sin, on the score of obvious culpability; and, suitably to this design, his argument is based, not on Scripture, but on observation of the facts of human nature and human history. It did not fall within his scope to trace the evil to its original cause. But here, having shown Jew and Gentile to be on the same footing with respect to sin, and having entered (at <a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>) on the doctrinal portion of his Epistle, he goes to Scripture for the origin of the evil, and finds it there attributed to Adam's original transgression, which implicated the human race as an organic whole. This is the scriptural solution of the mystery, which he here gives, not only as accounting for things being as they are, but also, in connection with the stage of the argument at which he has now arrived, as explaining the necessity and the purpose of the atonement for the whole guilty race, effected by the second Adam, Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all sinned</span>. To this sentence, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, there is no apodosis. One has been sought in the course of what follows, and by some found in ver. 18. But ver. 18 is a recapitulation rather than resumption of the argument, and is, further, too far removed to be intended as a formal apodesis. It is not really necessary to find one. The natural one to the first clause of the sentence would have been, "So through One <span class="accented">righteousness</span> entered into the world, and <span class="accented">life</span> through righteousness;" and such may be supposed to have been in the writer's mind. But, after his manner, he goes off to enlarge on the idea expressed in the second clause, and never formally completes his sentence. A similar anacoluthon is found in <a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>. Sin is here, as elsewhere, regarded as a <span class="accented">power</span> antagonistic to God, which has been introduced into the world of man, working and manifesting itself in concrete human sin (cf. <a href="/romans/5-21.htm">Romans 5:21</a>; <a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12, 14</a>; <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8, 9, 17</a>). Its ultimate origin is not explained. Scripture offers no solution of the old insoluble problem, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>: its existence at all under the sway of the Omnipotent Goodness in which we believe is one of the deep mysteries that have ever baffled human reason. All that is here touched on is its entrance into the world of man, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> implying that it already existed beyond this mundane sphere. The reference is, of course, to Gem fit., as the scriptural account of the beginning of sin in our own world. It is there attributed to "the serpent," whom we regard as a symbol of some mysterious power of evil, external to man, to which primeval man, in the exercise of his prerogative of free-will, succumbed, and so let sin in. Through <span class="accented">sin</span> entered also <span class="accented">death</span> as its consequence; which (primarily at least) must mean here physical death, this being all that is denoted in Genesis (comp. Genesis 3:19 with Gen 2:17), and necessary to be understood in what follows in the chapter before us (see ver. 14). But here a difficulty presents itself to modern thought. Are we to understand that man was originally so constituted as not to die? - that even his bodily organization was immortal, and would have continued so but for the fatal taint of sin? We find it difficult at the present day to conceive this, however bound we may feel to submit our reason to revelation in a matter so remote, so unknown, and so mysterious as the beginning of human life on the earth, in whatever aspect viewed, and indeed of all conscious life, must ever be. But St. Paul himself, in another place, speaks of "the first man" having been, even on his first creation, "of the earth, earthy" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45, 47</a>), with a body, like ours, of" flesh and blood," in its own nature corruptible (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>). Neither is the narrative of <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. inconsistent with this idea. For it seems to imply that, but for his eating of the mystical "tree of life" (whatever may be meant by it), the first man was in his own nature mortal, and that his liability to death ensued on his being debarred from it (<a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>). It may be impossible for us to understand or explain. The following considerations, however, may perhaps help us in some degree. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> When we pay regard to man's spiritual capabilities and aspirations, even as he is now, death does seem to us an anomaly - a contradiction to the ideal of his inner self. That a beast of the field should die appears to us no such anomaly; for it has done all that it seems to have been meant to do, or to be capable of doing: it has served as a link in the continuance of its kind, not having been conscious, as far as we know, of anything beyond its surroundings. But man (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> man as he is capable of being, so as to represent the capacity of humanity) connects himself in his inner self with eternity; his mind resents the idea of death, as an unwelcome stoppage to its development and its yearnings. It goes on ever maturing its power, enlarging its range, thirsting for higher knowledge, entertaining affections that seem eternal; and then bodily decay and death arrest its progress as it were in mid-career. Thus death, as it comes to us and affects us now, seems to involve a contradiction between man's inner consciousness and the facts of his existence at present; it is shrunk from as something that ought not to be. It is true that, when faith has once grasped the idea of bodily death being but a transition to a better life, the anomaly disappears: but such is its aspect to the natural man: and thus we can enter into the scriptural idea of death, as it comes to us so inevitably now, being something not originally meant for man, though we may be unable to say how it would have been with him had not sin entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though physical death, obvious to men's eyes, and not spiritual death of the soul either in this world or in the world to come, is here evidently in view (see ver. 14), yet we must bear in mind the general idea associated with the word "death" in the New Testament. It is sometimes used so as to imply more than the mere parting of the soul from the body, including in the conception of what it is all the woes and infirmities that flesh is heir to, which are its precursors in the present state of things (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 12, 16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>), being thus regarded also as the visible sign before our eyes of man's present alienation from the life that is in God. St. Paul, then, in the passage before us, though alleging mere natural death as sufficient evidence of sin, may be conceived as having in his view Death armed as he has been with a peculiar sting to man through all known time. The main point of his argument is that the doom recorded in Genesis as having been pronounced on Adam had obviously remained in force throughout the ages; and there is surely no difficulty in assenting to the position that the dominion of death, as it has been exercised since that doom, is evidence of its continuance, and consequently of sin. "For that all sinned" (more correctly so than, as in the Authorized Version, "all have sinned") seems to mean, not that all since Adam in their own persons committed sin, but that all sinned in him - were implicated in the sin of the progenitor (cf. ver. 15; also <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "in Adam all die;" and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>, where all are said to have died <span class="accented">to</span> sin in the death of Christ). The doctrine of <span class="accented">original</span>, as distinct from <span class="accented">actual</span>, sin, thus intimated, has been, as is well known, the subject of much controversy since the time of Pelagius. It does not fall within the proper scope of this Commentary to discuss the theories of divines, but rather to set forth candidly what the language of the portions of Scripture commented on in itself most obviously means, viewed in the light afforded by general Scripture teaching. With respect to the passage before us, it may suffice to say: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That more must be understood than the mere <span class="accented">imputation</span> of Adam's transgression to his descendants, irrespectively of any guilt of theirs. This notion, which jars on our conception of Divine justice, is precluded by the entire drift of the earlier chapters of this Epistle, which was the actual <span class="accented">culpability</span> of mankind at large, and also by what follows here, sin itself being spoken of - not the imputation of it only - as being in the world after Adam, and universal too, as evidenced by the continued reign of death. All men are said to have sinned in the sin of the first transgressor, because sin was thus introduced, as a power in human nature antagonistic to God, and because this "infection of nature" has continued since. And thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Pelagian position is also precluded, according to which "original sin standeth (<span class="accented">only</span>) in the following of Adam" (Art. 9.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in actual imitation of his sin, which man is supposed to have still, as Adam had, the power to avoid. For it is expressly said (ver. 14) that death reigned over - in proof that sin infected - even those who had not sinned after the similitude of his transgression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we must guard against confusion between the idea of man's natural liability to condemnation on the ground of transmitted sinfulness, and that of God's actual dealing with him. It is nowhere said or implied that the natural infection which they could not help will be visited on individuals in the final judgment. All that is insisted on by St. Paul is that man, in himself, as he is now, falls short of the glory of God, and cannot put in a plea for acceptance on the ground of his own righteousness. But he no less emphatically declares that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherefore as<p>As (&#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;) begins the first member of a comparison.
