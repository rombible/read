Yet some such persons there are. The one thing which is most extraordinary in the death of Christ, and which most tends to throw into relief the love of God as displayed in it, is that He died for men as sinners, and at the very moment when they were sinning all around Him.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Yet peradventure.</span>—The true reading is, undoubtedly, <span class= "ital">for peradventure.</span><p><span class= "bld">For a good man.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">for the good </span>(<span class= "ital">man</span>)<span class= "ital">, i.e.,</span> for the good man in question, the righteous man mentioned above. It would be possible to take the phrase “for the good” as neuter rather than masculine, and to understand by it “in a good cause.” It would be possible also to give to the word translated “good” the special meaning of “benefactor”—“a man might be found to die for his benefactor.” But if this had been intended, it might have been more clearly expressed, and upon the whole it seems best to take the passage as it is taken in the English version. There is a slight distinction in the Greek, as in English, between the words translated “righteous” and “good.” To be “righteous” is to direct the will in obedience to an external standard; to be “good” is to have a natural goodness, especially kindness or benevolence of disposition. But this distinction is not insisted upon here. The two words are used almost convertibly.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-11 Christ died for sinners; not only such as were useless, but such as were guilty and hateful; such that their everlasting destruction would be to the glory of God's justice. Christ died to save us, not in our sins, but from our sins; and we were yet sinners when he died for us. Nay, the carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself, chap. 8:7; Col 1:21. But God designed to deliver from sin, and to work a great change. While the sinful state continues, God loathes the sinner, and the sinner loathes God, Zec 11:8. And that for such as these Christ should die, is a mystery; no other such an instance of love is known, so that it may well be the employment of eternity to adore and wonder at it. Again; what idea had the apostle when he supposed the case of some one dying for a righteous man? And yet he only put it as a thing that might be. Was it not the undergoing this suffering, that the person intended to be benefitted might be released therefrom? But from what are believers in Christ released by his death? Not from bodily death; for that they all do and must endure. The evil, from which the deliverance could be effected only in this astonishing manner, must be more dreadful than natural death. There is no evil, to which the argument can be applied, except that which the apostle actually affirms, sin, and wrath, the punishment of sin, determined by the unerring justice of God. And if, by Divine grace, they were thus brought to repent, and to believe in Christ, and thus were justified by the price of his bloodshedding, and by faith in that atonement, much more through Him who died for them and rose again, would they be kept from falling under the power of sin and Satan, or departing finally from him. The living Lord of all, will complete the purpose of his dying love, by saving all true believers to the uttermost. Having such a pledge of salvation in the love of God through Christ, the apostle declared that believers not only rejoiced in the hope of heaven, and even in their tribulations for Christ's sake, but they gloried in God also, as their unchangeable Friend and all-sufficient Portion, through Christ only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For scarcely ... - The design of this verse and the following is, to illustrate the great love of God by comparing it with what man was willing to do. "It is an unusual occurrence, an event which is all that we can hope for from the highest human benevolence and the purest friendship, that one would be willing to die for a good man. There are none who would be willing to die for a man who was seeking to do us injury, to calumniate our character, to destroy our happiness or our property. But Christ was willing to die for bitter foes."<p>Scarcely - With difficulty. It is an event which cannot be expected to occur often. There would scarcely be found an instance in which it would happen.<p>A righteous man - A just man; a man distinguished simply for integrity of conduct; one who has no remarkable claims for amiableness of character, for benevolence, or for personal friendship. Much as we may admire such a man, and applaud him, yet he has not the characteristics which would appeal to our hearts to induce us to lay down our lives for him. Accordingly, it is not known that any instance has occurred where for such a man one would be willing to die.<p>For a righteous man - That is, in his place, or in his stead. A man would scarcely lay down his own life to save that of a righteous man.<p>Will one die - Would one be will. ing to die.<p>Yet peradventure - Perhaps; implying that this was an event which might be expected to occur.<p>For a good man - That is, not merely a man who is coldly just; but a man whose characteristic is that of kindness, amiableness, tenderness. It is evident that the case of such a man would be much more likely to appeal to our feelings, than that of one who is merely a man of integrity. Such a man is susceptible of tender friendship; and probably the apostle intended to refer to such a case - a case where we would be willing to expose life for a kind, tender, faithful friend.<p>Some would even dare to die - Some would have courage to give his life. Instances of this kind, though not many, have occurred. The affecting case of Damon and Pythias is one. Damon had been condemned to death by the tyrant Dionysius of Sicily, and obtained leave to go and settle his domestic affairs on promise of returning at a stated hour to the place of execution. Pythias pledged himself to undergo the punishment if Damon should not return in time, and deliver himself into the hands of the tyrant. Damon returned at the appointed moment, just as the sentence was about to be executed on Pythias; and Dionysius was so struck with the fidelity of the two friends, that he remitted their punishment, and entreated them to permit him to share their friendship; (Val. Max. 4. 7.) This case stands almost alone. Our Saviour says that it is the highest expression of love among people. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;" <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>. The friendship of David and Jonathan seems also to have been of this character, that one would have been willing to lay down his life for the other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

(To make the "righteous" and the "good" man here to mean the same person, and the whole sense to be that "though rare, the case may occur, of one making a sacrifice of life for a worthy character" [as Calvin, Beza, Fritzsche, Jowett], is extremely flat.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He amplifies the love of Christ in dying for the ungodly, and shows that it is unparalleled and without example. By <span class="bld">a good man</span> you must understand one that is very kind and bountiful, or one that is very useful and profitable; that is, a public and common good. Instances may be given of those that have sacrificed their lives for such. Lilloe stepped between the murderer and king Edward his master. Nicholas Ribische lost his life to preserve Prince Maurice at the siege of Pista. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die,.... The design of this, and the following verse, is to show that Christ's dying for ungodly persons is an instance of kindness that is matchless and unparalleled. By "a righteous man", is not meant a truly gracious, holy man; nor one that is made righteous by the obedience of Christ; but one that is so in his own eyes, and in the esteem of others, being outwardly moral and righteous before men; who keeps to the letter of the law, and does, as he imagines, what that externally requires: such were the Pharisees among the Jews, who, though they were had in much outward esteem and veneration among the people, yet were rather feared than loved; and it would have been a difficult thing to have found a person that would cheerfully venture, and lay down his life for any of that complexion and cast: <p>yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. By "a good man", is not meant a man made so by the grace of God, and who is indeed truly and properly the only good man; but a liberal and beneficent man, who was very bountiful in his charitable distributions to the poor, and very liberal in contributing towards the charge of sacrifices, repairs of the temple, &amp;c. and did more this way than what the law obliged to. Now for such a man perhaps there might be some found so daring and hardy, as to venture and lay down their lives, when there was any danger of his, or any necessity for so doing; so great an interest such men had in the affections of the people. And so the Jews (z) distinguish between  "a righteous man", and  "a good man". They say (a), <p>"there is a righteous man that is good, and there is a righteous man that is not good; but he that is good for heaven, and the creatures, i.e. for God and men, this is , "a righteous good man"; but he that is good to God, and evil to men, this is  , "a righteous man that is not good".'' <p>The whole body of the people of the Jews were divided into three sorts: take a short sentence out of their Talmud (b), not to support the justness of the characters, but for the sake of this threefold division of the people: <p>"three things are said concerning the paring of the nails,  "a righteous man" buries them,  "a good man" burns them,  "a wicked man" casts them away.'' <p>Now to this division of the people the apostle alludes; and there is in the words a beautiful gradation, scarcely for one of the  "righteous men", who does just what he is obliged to do by the law, and no more, will any die; perhaps it may be, that for one of  "the good men", who are very liberal to the poor, and towards defraying all the expenses of the temple service, in which they exceed the strict demands of the law, some may be found willing to die; but who will die for the  "the wicked and ungodly", the profligate and abandoned part of the people? not one, but Christ died for the ungodly: wherefore if instances could be produced of men's dying either for righteous men, or good men, these would not come up to the instance of Christ's dying for men, who were neither righteous nor good. <p>(z) Maimon in Misn Pirke Abot, c. 5. sect. 10, 13.

Luther). On account of the same contrast, consequently because of the parallel between <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΔΙΚΑΊΟΥ</span></span></span>, and because the context generally has to do only with the dying for <span class="ital">persons</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> also is to be taken not as neuter,[1198] but as masculine; and the article denotes <span class="ital">the definite</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span> <span class="ital">who is in question</span> in the case concerned. Since, moreover, an essential distinction between <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΘΌς</span></span></span> (comp on the contrary <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>; further, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝῊΡ ἈΓΑΘῸς Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> in <a href="/luke/23-50.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:">Luke 23:50</a>; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἘΝΤΟΛῊ ἉΓΊΑ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΔΙΚΑΊΑ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓΑΘΉ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΔΊΚΑΙΟς ἩΜῖΝ ἈΝΑΠΈΦΑΝΤΑΙ ὬΝ ἈΓΑΘΌς ΤΕ ΚΑῚ ΣΟΦΌς</span></span></span>, Aesch. <span class="ital">Sept.</span> 576; Eur. <span class="ital">Hipp.</span> 427; <span class="ital">Thes.</span> fr. viii. 2) is neither implied in the context, where on the contrary the contrast to both is <span class="greekheb">ἀσεβῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΩΛῶΝ</span></span></span>, nor is in the least hinted at by Paul, no explanation is admissible that is based on an essential difference of idea in the two words; such as that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἈΓΑΘΟῦ</span></span></span> should be held to express something <span class="ital">different from</span> or <span class="ital">higher</span> than <span class="greekheb">δικαίου</span>. Therefore the following is the only explanation that presents itself as conformable to the words and context: After Paul has said that one will hardly die for a righteous man, he wishes to add, by way of confirmation (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΆΡ</span></span></span>), <span class="ital">that cases of the undertaking such a death might possibly occur</span>, and expresses this in the form: <span class="ital">for perhaps for the good man one even takes it upon him to die</span>. Thus the previously asserted <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ δικαίου τις ἀποθανεῖται</span>, although one assents to it <span class="ital">vix et aegre</span>, is yet said <span class="ital">with reason</span>,—<span class="ital">it may perhaps occur</span>. Paul has not however written <span class="greekheb">τοῦ δικαίου</span> in the second clause of the verse, as he might have done, but introduces <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἈΓΑΘΟῦ</span></span></span>, and prefixes it, in order now to make still more apparent, in the interest of the contrast, the category of the <span class="ital">quality</span> of the person for whom one may perhaps venture this self-sacrifice. This is substantially the view arrived at by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Erasmus, in the <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>., Beza, Calvin (“rarissimum sane inter homines exemplum exstat, ut pro justo mori quis sustineat, <span class="ital">quamquam illud nonnunquam accidere possit</span>”), Castalio, Calovius, and others; recently again by Fritzsche (also Oltramare and Reithmayr); formerly also by Hofmann (in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 348). It has been wrongly alleged that it makes the second half of the verse superfluous (de Wette) and weakening (Köllner and Rückert); on the contrary, in granting what may certainly now and again occur, it the more emphatically paves the way for the contrast which is to follow, that God has caused Christ to die for quite other persons than the <span class="greekheb">δικαίους</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΘΟῦς</span></span></span>—for us <span class="ital">sinners</span>. Groundless also is the objection (of van Hengel), that in Paul’s writings the repeated <span class="greekheb">τίς</span> always denotes <span class="ital">different</span> subjects; the indefinite <span class="greekheb">τίς</span>, <span class="ital">one, any one</span>, may indeed even here represent in the concrete application <span class="ital">different</span> subjects or the <span class="ital">same</span>. Comp <a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>. And, even if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΊΟΥ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἈΓΑΘΟῦ</span></span></span> be regarded as two distinct conceptions, may not the second <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊς</span></span></span> be <span class="ital">the same</span> with the first? But the perfect accordance with the words and context, which is only found in the exposition offered, shuts out every other. Among the explanations thus excluded are: (1) Those which take <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> as <span class="ital">neuter</span>, like the rendering of Jerome, Erasmus, <span class="ital">Annot.</span> (“bonitatem”), Luther, Melancthon (“pro bona et suavi re, i. e. incitati cupiditate aut opinione magnae utilitatis”), and more recently Rückert (“for the good, <span class="ital">i.e. for what he calls his highest good</span>”), Mehring (“<span class="ital">for for his own advantage some one perhaps risks even life</span>”); now also Hofmann (“what is <span class="ital">in itself</span> and <span class="ital">really</span> good.… <span class="ital">a moral value</span>, for which, when it is endangered, one sacrifices life, in order not to let it perish”).—(2) Those explanations which indeed take <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> properly as <span class="ital">masculine</span>, but yet give self-invented <span class="ital">distinctions of idea</span> in reference to <span class="greekheb">δικαίου</span>; namely (<span class="ital">a</span>), the exposition, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀγαθός</span> means <span class="ital">the benefactor: hardly does any one die for a righteous man</span> (who stands in no closer relation to him); <span class="ital">for for his benefactor one dares perchance</span> (out of gratitude) <span class="ital">to die</span>. So Flacius,[1201] Knatchbull, Estius, Hammond, Clericus, Heumann, Wolf, and others; including Koppe, Tholuck, Winer, Benecke, Reiche, Glöckler, Krehl, Maier, Umbreit, Bisping, Lechler and Jatho. They take the article with <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοῦ</span> as: the benefactor <span class="ital">whom he has</span>, against which nothing can be objected (Bernhardy, p. 315). But we may object that we cannot at all see why Paul should not have expressed <span class="ital">benefactor</span> by the very current and definite term <span class="greekheb">εὐεργέτης</span>; and that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΘΌς</span></span></span> must have obtained the specific sense of <span class="ital">beneficence</span> (as in <a href="/matthew/20-15.htm" title="Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?

Hence, in order to gain for <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span> the sense <span class="ital">beneficent</span> in keeping with the context, <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> would have to be taken in the narrower sense as <span class="ital">just</span> (with Wetstein and Olshausen), so as to yield a climax from the <span class="ital">just</span> man to the <span class="ital">benevolent</span> (who renders more than the mere obligation of right binds him to do). An apt illustration of this would be Cicero, <span class="ital">de off.</span> iii Romans 15 : “Si vir bonus is est, qui prodest quibus potest, nocet nemini, recte <span class="ital">justum</span> virum, <span class="ital">bonum</span> non facile reperiemus.” But in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a> there is no reference to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span> in the sense assumed; and the <span class="ital">narrower</span> sense of <span class="greekheb">δικαίος</span> is at variance with the contrasting <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΩΛῶΝ</span></span></span> in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>, which demands for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚ</span></span></span>, precisely the <span class="ital">wider</span> meaning (righteous). Besides the prominence which Paul intends to give to the love of God, which caused Christ to die for <span class="ital">sinners</span>, while a man hardly dies for a <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, is weakened just in proportion as the sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> is narrowed.

Christ’s death for the ungodly assures us of God’s love; for the utmost that human love will do is far less. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ δικαίου</span>: for a righteous man. Some make both <span class="greekheb">δικαίου</span> and <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> neuter: some who take <span class="greekheb">δικαίου</span> as masculine take <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> as neuter (so Weiss and Godet—“pour un juste, pour le bien”): but as Jowett says, the notion of dying for an abstract idea is entirely unlike the N.T., or the age in which the N.T. was written, while the opposition to Christ’s dying for sinful persons requires that persons should be in question here also. The absence of the article with <span class="greekheb">δικαίου</span> corresponds to the virtually negative character of the clause: it is inserted before <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοῦ</span> because the exceptional case is definitely conceived as happening. <span class="greekheb">ἀποθανεῖται</span>, gnomic; see Burton, § 69. Unless <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὸς</span> is meant to suggest a certain advance upon <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, it is impossible to see in what respect the second clause adds anything to the first. Of course the words are broadly synonymous, so that often they are both applied to the same person or thing (<a href="/luke/23-50.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:">Luke 23:50</a>, <a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>); still there is a difference, and it answers to their application here; it is <span class="ital">difficult</span> to die for a just man, it has been found <span class="ital">possible</span> (one may venture to affirm) to die for a good man. The difference is like that between “just” and “good” in English: the latter is the more generous and inspiring type of character. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the Gnostic contrast between the “just” God of the O.T. and the “good” God of the N.T., and the passages quoted in Cremer, <span class="ital">s.v</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τολμᾷ</span>: even prevails upon himself, wins it from himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>, &c.] The connexion is somewhat thus: “He died for the godless: a proof of unequalled love; for hardly will you find any one die for a just, a good, man; you may find such a case, but it will be rare.”—No marked distinction is meant between “<span class="ital">just</span>” and “<span class="ital">good</span>.” Justice and goodness are equally contrasted with godlessness and sinfulness here. As regards the wording of the verse, it is lit. <span class="bld">For hardly for a just man will one die; for for the good man, perhaps, one actually dares to die</span>. The first “<span class="ital">for</span>” in the second clause may be explained by a paraphrase: “Death for even a just person is hardly known. I say, <span class="ital">hardly</span> known; not quite <span class="ital">unknown;</span> for cases of death for one who is good do occur.” The whole point of the verse is that such acts of even such love among men are very rare and very limited indeed. (The translation “for a just <span class="ital">cause</span>,” “for <span class="ital">that</span> which is good,” is precluded, as Meyer points out, by the <span class="ital">personal</span> words in contrast; “the godless,” “sinners.”)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/5-7.htm" title="For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.">Romans 5:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δικαίου</span>. το͂<span class="greekheb">υ</span> ἀγαθο͂<span class="greekheb">υ</span>) Masculines; with which comp. <a href="/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a>; <a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>, as <span class="ital">Th.

When there is any doubt respecting the peculiar force of an expression, and a difference between words, it will be of much advantage if you either suppose something in the meanwhile, or transpose the words. Accordingly, by transposing the words in this passage, we shall read: <span class="greekheb">μόλις γὰρ ὑπὲρ ἀγαθοῦ τις</span> ἀποθανε͂<span class="greekheb">ιται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ γὰρ δικαίου τάχα τὶς καὶ τολμᾷ</span> ἀποθανε͂<span class="greekheb">ιν</span>, <span class="ital">for scarcely for a good man will one die, for peradventure for a righteous man, some one would even dare to die</span>) suppose, to wit, also, that ἀγαθο͂<span class="greekheb">υ</span> is put without the article. You will immediately perceive the disadvantage to the sense, with which this change would be attended, and it will appear evident, that there is both some difference between <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὸν</span>, and a great one between <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀγαθὸν</span>, wheresoever that difference in the consecutive words may be found hereafter. In fact, the article so placed, makes a climax. Every good man is righteous; but every righteous man is not good. <span class="ital">Gregory Thaumaturgus</span>; <span class="greekheb">περὶ</span> πολλο͂<span class="greekheb">υ καὶ ΤΟΥ παντός</span>. Chrysostom; <span class="greekheb">μικρὰ ταῦτα καὶ ΤΟ μηδεν</span>, <span class="ital">those things of little importance, and that which is of no importance whatever</span>. The Hebrews call a man <span class="greekheb">צדיק</span>, who performs his lawful duties; <span class="greekheb">חסיד</span>, who performs acts of kindness. The Greeks call the former <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>; the latter, <span class="greekheb">ὃσιος</span>; comp. <span class="greekheb">צדק </span>and <span class="greekheb">ענוה</span>, <a href="/zephaniah/2-3.htm" title="Seek you the LORD, all you meek of the earth, which have worked his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be you shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.">Zephaniah 2:3</a>, but in this passage we have not <span class="greekheb">ὁσίου</span>, but το͂<span class="greekheb">υ ἀγαθοῦ</span>. Wherefore the distinction between the Hebrew words does not determine the point. But this much is certain, that just as <span class="greekheb">ὅσιος</span>, so also <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὸς</span> expresses more than <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>.

And so Paul, in this passage, judges <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀγαθὸν</span>, the good man to be more worthy, that one should die for him, than <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>, a righteous man. <span class="greekheb">Ἀσεβεῖς</span> [<a href="/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a>] and <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀγαθὸς</span>, the ungodly and the good man, also <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοὶ</span> [<a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>], a righteous man and sinners, are respectively opposed to each other.

Bengel says: "&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, indefinitely, implies an innocent man; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; one perfect in all that piety demands; excellent, honorable, princely, blessed; for example, the father of his country."<p>Therefore, according to Paul, though one would hardly die for the merely upright or strictly just man who commands respect, he might possibly die for the noble, beneficent man, who calls out affection. The article is omitted with righteous, and supplied with good - the good man, pointing to such a case as a rare and special exception. </body></html>
