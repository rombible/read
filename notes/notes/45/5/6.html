That love was evidenced in the death of Christ. And consider what that death was. It is rare enough for one man to die for another—even for a good man. Christ died not for good men, but for sinners, and while they were sinners. If then His death had the power to save us from punishment, it is an easy thing to believe that His life will lead us to glory.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">For when we were yet . . .</span>—The reading at the beginning of this verse is doubtful. The reading of the Vatican MS. is very attractive, “If at least,” “If, as we know to be the fact, Christ died,” &c. But, unfortunately, this has not much further external support. If we keep the common reading we must either translate “For, moreover,” or we may suppose that there is some confusion between two constructions, and the word translated “yet” came to be repeated.<p><span class= "bld">Without strength.</span>—Powerless to work out our own salvation.<p><span class= "bld">In due time.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">in due season.</span> So the Authorised version, rightly.

Observe, reader, Christ not only died to set us an example, or to procure us power to follow it, but to atone for our sins; for it does not appear that this expression, of dying for any one, has any other signification than that of rescuing his life by laying down our own. “By the <span class="ital">ungodly </span>here, Mr. Locke understands <span class="ital">Gentiles, </span>as also by <span class="ital">weak, sinners, enemies, </span>&c. They are undoubtedly included; but it seems very inconsistent with the whole strain of the apostle’s argument in the preceding chapters, to confine it to them.

I therefore,” says Dr. Doddridge, “all along explain such passages in the most extensive sense; and think nothing in the whole New Testament plainer, than that the gospel supposes every human creature, to whom it is addressed, to be in a state of guilt and condemnation, and incapable of being accepted with God, any otherwise than through the grace and mercy which it proclaims.

Christ died to save us, not in our sins, but from our sins; and we were yet sinners when he died for us. Nay, the carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself, chap. 8:7; Col 1:21. But God designed to deliver from sin, and to work a great change. While the sinful state continues, God loathes the sinner, and the sinner loathes God, Zec 11:8. And that for such as these Christ should die, is a mystery; no other such an instance of love is known, so that it may well be the employment of eternity to adore and wonder at it. Again; what idea had the apostle when he supposed the case of some one dying for a righteous man? And yet he only put it as a thing that might be. Was it not the undergoing this suffering, that the person intended to be benefitted might be released therefrom? But from what are believers in Christ released by his death? Not from bodily death; for that they all do and must endure. The evil, from which the deliverance could be effected only in this astonishing manner, must be more dreadful than natural death. There is no evil, to which the argument can be applied, except that which the apostle actually affirms, sin, and wrath, the punishment of sin, determined by the unerring justice of God. And if, by Divine grace, they were thus brought to repent, and to believe in Christ, and thus were justified by the price of his bloodshedding, and by faith in that atonement, much more through Him who died for them and rose again, would they be kept from falling under the power of sin and Satan, or departing finally from him. The living Lord of all, will complete the purpose of his dying love, by saving all true believers to the uttermost. Having such a pledge of salvation in the love of God through Christ, the apostle declared that believers not only rejoiced in the hope of heaven, and even in their tribulations for Christ's sake, but they gloried in God also, as their unchangeable Friend and all-sufficient Portion, through Christ only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when ... - This opens a new view of the subject, or it is a new argument to show that our hope will not make ashamed, or will not disappoint us. The first argument he had stated in the previous verse, that the Holy Spirit was given to us. The next, which he now states, is, that God had given the most ample proof that he would save us by giving his Son when we were sinners; and that he who had done so much for us when we were enemies, would not now fail us when we are his friends; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-10</a>. He has performed the more difficult part of the work by reconciling us when we were enemies; and he will not now forsake us, but will carry forward and complete what he has begun.<p>We were yet without strength - The word used here &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  astheno&#772;n is usually applied to those who are sick and feeble, deprived of strength by disease; <a href="/matthew/25-38.htm">Matthew 25:38</a>; <a href="/luke/10-9.htm">Luke 10:9</a>; <a href="/acts/4-9.htm">Acts 4:9</a>; <a href="/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a>. But it is also used in a moral sense, to denote inability or feebleness with regard to any undertaking or duty. Here it means that we were without strength "in regard to the case which the apostle was considering;" that is, we had no power to devise a scheme of justification, to make an atonement, or to put away the wrath of God, etc. While all hope of man's being saved by any plan of his own was thus taken away; while he was thus lying exposed to divine justice, and dependent on the mere mercy of God; God provided a plan which met the case, and secured his salvation. The remark of the apostle here has reference only to the condition of the race before an atonement is made. It does not pertain to the question whether man has strength to repent and to believe after an atonement is made, which is a very different inquiry.<p>In due time - Margin "According to the time" &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  kata kairon.

All experiments had failed to save people. For four thousand years the trial had been made under the Law among the Jews: and by the aid of the most enlightened reason in Greece and Rome; and still it was in vain. No scheme had been devised to meet the maladies of the world, and to save people from death. It was then time that a better plan should be presented to people.<p>(2) it was the time fixed and appointed by God for the Messiah to come; the time which had been designated by the prophets; <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>; see <a href="/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>.<p>(3) it was a most favorable time for the spread of the gospel.

The apostle having mentioned the love of God proceeds to give an instance, and which is a full proof and demonstration of it, which is, that <p>in due time Christ died for the ungodly. That Christ died is certain; the death of Christ was foretold in prophecy, typified by the sacrifices of slain beasts, was spoken of by himself, both before and since his death; his enemies have never denied it; and this was the sum of the ministry of the apostles, and is the great article of faith: and that the death of Christ is a singular instance of the love of God, is evident by considering the person that died, the Son of God in human nature, his own, his only begotten Son, his beloved Son; the concern which God had in it, by willing, ordering, and appointing it, awaking the sword of justice against him, not sparing him, but delivering him up for us all; also the nature, kind, and manner of his death, and particularly the persons for whom he died, here described: he "died for the ungodly"; not for himself, he had no sins of his own to die for, nor did he want any happiness to procure; nor for angels, but for men; and these not holy, just, and good men, but ungodly; and not as a mere martyr, or only by way of example to them, and so for their good; but as the Syriac version reads it, , "in the room", or "stead of the ungodly", as their surety to make satisfaction for their sins. The Jews have a notion of the Messiah's being a substitute, and standing in the place and stead of sinners; and they say (x), <p>"that Aaron filled up the place of the first Adam, and was brought near in the room of him;'' <p>which is true of Christ, the antitype of Aaron. On those words, "I will give a man for thee", <a href="/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>; the doctors (y) say, <p>"do not read Adam, but Edom; for when God removes the decree (or punishment) from a particular man, he provides for the attribute of justice in the room of the man that sinned,   , "another man that comes from Edom";'' <p>referring, as I think, to <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>. And this their character of ungodly shows, that not goodness in man, but love in God, was the moving cause of Christ's dying for them; and that the end of his dying was to atone for their ungodliness: and to illustrate the love of God the more towards them in this instance, they are said to be "without strength" at that time; being so enfeebled by sin, that they were not capable of fulfilling the law, of atoning for the transgressions of it, of redeeming themselves from slavery, of beginning and carrying on a work of holiness their hearts, nor indeed of doing one good thing. Add to all this, that Christ died for these persons in due time; in the most fit, proper, and convenient season to illustrate the love and grace of God; when man appeared both weak and wicked; when the weakness of the legal dispensation had been sufficiently evinced, and the wickedness of man, both among Jews and Gentiles, was at a very great height: or rather by "due time" is meant the "fulness of time", <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; the time appointed in council by God, agreed to by Christ, and fixed in prophecy; before the departure of the sceptre from Judah, the destruction of the second temple, and at the close of Daniel's weeks. <p>(x) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 96. 1. &amp; 97. 4. &amp; 98. 3.((y) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 93. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For when we were yet without strength, in due <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> time Christ died for the ungodly.</span><p>(7) A sure comfort in adversity, so that our peace and quietness of conscience are not troubled: for he that so loved them that were of no strength and while they were yet sinners, that he died for them, how can he neglect them, having now been sanctified and living in him?<p>(f) At an appropriate and proper time which the Father had appointed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a>.

When our powerlessness had reached its highest point, then Christ died, at the time which God had previously determined, and in such a manner, that He died neither too soon nor too late (comp. the expression in the time that now is [at this time] ch. 4:26), and was not held too long [longer than was needful] under the power of death.

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet</span> (<span class="accented">literally,for</span>) <span class="cmt_word">peradventure for the good man some would even dare to die</span>. The general purport of ver. 7 is obvious, viz. to show how Christ's death for the ungodly transcends all human instances of self-sacrifice for others. But the exact import of the language used is not equally plain. That of the first clause, indeed, and its connection with what precedes, presents no difficulty. The meaning is that Christ's dying for the <span class="accented">ungodly</span> is a proof of love beyond what is common among men. The second clause seems to be added as a concession of what some men may perhaps sometimes be capable cf. It is introduced by a second <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> (this being the reading of all the manuscripts), which may be meant <span class="accented">as exceptive</span>, "I do not press this without exception," being understood. So Alford; and in this case the "yet" of the Authorized Version, or <span class="accented">though</span>, may give its meaning. Or it may be connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, thus: "Scarcely, I say, for there may possibly be cases," etc. But what is the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the first clause and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the second? Some interpreters say that there is none, the intention being simply to express the possibility of human self-sacrifice for one that is good or righteous in some rare cases. But the change of the word, which would, according to this view, be purposeless, and still more the insertion of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, forbids this interpretation. One view is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is neuter, meaning that, though for a righteous individual one can hardly be found to be willing to die, yet for the cause of good, for what a man regards as the highest good, or <span class="accented">pro bone publico</span> (it might be), such self-sacrifice may be possible; This view is tenable, though against it is the fact that death in behalf of <span class="accented">persons</span> is being spoken of all along. The remaining and most commonly accepted view is that by "the good man" (the article pointing him out generally as a well-known type of character) is meant the beneficent - one who inspires attachment and devotion - as opposed to one who is merely just. Cicero ('De Off.,' 3:15) is quoted in support of this distinction between the words: "Si vir bonus is est qui prodest quibus potest, nemini nocet, recte <span class="accented">justum</span> virum, <span class="accented">bonum</span> non facile reperiemus." Tholuck quotes, as a Greek instance, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (AElian, 'Var. Histor.,' 3:17). Possibly the term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> would have a well-understood meaning to the readers of the Epistle, which is not equally obvious to us. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For the ungodly (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>It is much disputed whether &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1; on behalf of, is ever equivalent to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; instead of. The classical writers furnish instances where the meanings seem to be interchanged. Thus Xenophon: "Seuthes asked, Wouldst thou, Episthenes, die for this one (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)?" Seuthes asked the boy if he should smite him (Episthenes) instead of him (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;' &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) So Irenaeus: "Christ gave His life for (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;) our lives, and His flesh for (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;) our flesh." Plato, "Gorgias," 515, "If you will not answer for yourself, I must answer for you (&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)." In the New Testament Plm 1:13 is cited; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, A.V., in thy stead; Rev., in thy behalf. So <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>, "baptized for the dead (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)." The meaning of this passage, however, is so uncertain that it cannot fairly be cited in evidence. The preposition may have a local meaning, over the dead. None of these passages can be regarded as decisive. The most that can be said is that &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1; borders on the meaning of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;. Instead of is urged largely on dogmatic grounds. In the great majority of passages the sense is clearly for the sake of, on behalf of. The true explanation seems to be that, in the passages principally in question, those, namely, relating to Christ's death, as here, <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1; characterizes the more indefinite and general proposition - Christ died on behalf of - leaving the peculiar sense of in behalf of undetermined, and to be settled by other passages. The meaning instead of may be included in it, but only inferentially. Godet says: "The preposition can signify only in behalf of. It refers to the end, not at all to the mode of the work of redemption."<p>Ungodly<p>The radical idea of the word is, want of reverence or of piety. </body></html>
