But the grace and mercy of God, and the free gift of righteousness and salvation, are through Jesus Christ, as man: yet the Lord from heaven has brought the multitude of believers into a more safe and exalted state than that from which they fell in Adam. This free gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed them in a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had he stood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity. As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnation of all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to the justification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace of God, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yet multitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, rather than to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace. But Christ will in nowise cast out any who are willing to come to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if - This verse contains the same idea as before presented, but in a varied form. It is condensing the whole subject, and presenting it in a single view.<p>By one man's offence - Or, by one offence. Margin. The reading of the text is the more correct. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."<p>Death reigned - Note, <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>.<p>By one - By means of one man.<p>Much more - We have much more reason to expect it. It evidently accords much more with the administration of a Being of infinite goodness.<p>They which receive abundance of grace - The abundant favor; the mercy that shall counterbalance and surpass the evils introduced by the sin of Adam. That favor shall be more than sufficient to counterbalance all those evils. This is particularly true of the redeemed, of whom the apostle in this verse is speaking. The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour.<p>The gift of righteousness - This stands opposed to the evils introduced by Adam. As the effect of his sin was to produce condemnation, so here the gift of righteousness refers to the opposite, to pardon, to justification, to acceptance with God. To show that people were thus justified by the gospel, was the leading design of the apostle; and the argument here is, that if by one man's sin, death reigned over those who were under condemnation in consequence of it, we have much more reason to suppose that they who are delivered from sin by the death of Christ, and accepted of God, shall reign with him in life.<p>Shall reign - The word "reign" is often applied to the condition of saints in heaven, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him;" <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>. It means that they shall be exalted to a glorious state of happiness in heaven; that they shall be triumphant over all their enemies; shall gain an ultimate victory; and shall partake with the Captain of their salvation in the splendors of his dominion above, <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>.<p>In life - This stands opposed to the death that reigned as the consequence of the sin of Adam. It denotes complete freedom from condemnation; from temporal death; from sickness, pain, and sin. It is the usual expression to denote the complete bliss of the saints in glory; Note, <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>By one, Jesus Christ - As the consequence of his work. The apostle here does not state the mode or manner in which this was done; nor does he say that it was perfectly parallel in the mode with the effects of the sin of Adam. He is comparing the results or consequences of the sin of the one and of the work of the other. There is a similarity in the consequences. The way in which the work of Christ had contributed to this he had stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>, <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. For if by&#8212;"the"<p>one man's offence death reigned by one&#8212;"through the one."<p>much more shall they which receive&#8212;"the"<p>abundance of grace and of the gift of&#8212;justifying<p>righteousness &#8230; reign in life by one Jesus Christ&#8212;"through the one." We have here the two ideas of Ro 5:15 and Ro 5:16 sublimely combined into one, as if the subject had grown upon the apostle as he advanced in his comparison of the two cases. Here, for the first time in this section, he speaks of that LIFE which springs out of justification, in contrast with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation. The proper idea of it therefore is, "Right to live"&#8212;"Righteous life"&#8212;life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of "Him that sitteth on the Throne"; life therefore in its widest sense&#8212;life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever. It is worthy of note, too, that while he says death "reigned over" us through Adam, he does not say Life "reigns over us" through Christ; lest he should seem to invest this new life with the very attribute of death&#8212;that of fell and malignant tyranny, of which we were the hapless victims. Nor does he say Life reigns in us, which would have been a scriptural enough idea; but, which is much more pregnant, "We shall reign in life." While freedom and might are implied in the figure of "reigning," "life" is represented as the glorious territory or atmosphere of that reign. And by recurring to the idea of Ro 5:16, as to the "many offenses" whose complete pardon shows "the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness," the whole statement is to this effect: "If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!" (On the import of the future tense in this last clause, see on [2198]Ro 5:19, and [2199]Ro 6:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he shows the difference in respect of the effects and consequents of their acts. If by means of one man and his one offence death had power over all mankind, then much more shall the grace and gift of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ alone, obtain eternal life for all that have received abundant grace and mercy from him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one,.... It may be rendered, "by one offence death reigned by one"; for it was the single sin of Adam, the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning power over the sons of men: <p>"Adam, say (f) the Jewish doctors, transgressed,   , one commandment of the law,'' <p>and was the cause of death to himself, and to all the world. These words are a repetition, with a further explanation, of <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>; there it is said, "through the offence of one many be dead"; here "by one man's offence", or "by one offence, death reigned by one"; in which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and faculty of the soul of man; and likewise an eternal one, which will have power over all those, who have no part in the first resurrection: in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, "the grace of God, and the gift by grace", are said to "abound unto many"; here they are said to <p>receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness: by abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the justifying righteousness of Christ; such as the abundant grace and mercy of God, in regeneration and conversion; the various graces of the Spirit then implanted; the many things then wrought in the heart; the large discoveries! of pardoning grace, and the abundance of the love of God shed abroad in the soul by the Spirit: or rather the same with "the gift of righteousness", because of the large display of the grace of God in it; by which "righteousness" is meant, not righteousness or holiness infused into us; but the righteousness of Christ, which is a free grace gift, and is enjoyed in a way of receiving; which denotes the act of faith, and supposes giving; and hence there is no room for boasting, but great reason for thankfulness: now such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift, <p>shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life; they reign now in spiritual life over sin, Satan, and the world; and they will reign in eternal life, they will sit on thrones, wear crowns, and possess a kingdom of glory for ever and ever; and all by and through one, Jesus Christ, and not on account of any works, or merits of theirs. <p>(f) Zohar in Num. fol. 52. 1.

Observe, further, that in the apodosis Paul does not say <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΖΩΉ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΎΣΕΙ ἘΠῚ ΤΟῪς</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ΛΑΜΒΆΝΟΝΤΑς</span></span></span> in accordance with the protasis, but appropriately, and in harmony with the active nature of the relation, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the future glorious liberty of the children of God, places the subjects actively in the foreground, and affirms of <span class="ital">them</span> the reigning <span class="ital">in</span> life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> is added <span class="ital">as if in triumph</span>, in contradistinction to the unnamed but well-known <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span>, who occasioned the dominion of death. Finally, we should not fail to notice how in this passage the glance proceeds from the status <span class="ital">gratiae</span> (<span class="greekheb">λαμβάνοντες</span>) backward to the status <span class="ital">irae</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσε</span>), and forward to the status <span class="ital">gloriae</span> (<span class="greekheb">βασιλεύσουσι</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>. This verse confirms the preceding. The argument is the same in kind as in <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>. The effects of the Fall are indubitable: still less open to doubt are the effects of the work of Christ. With <span class="greekheb">οἱ τὴν περισσείαν τῆς χάριτος καὶ</span> [<span class="greekheb">τῆς δωρεᾶς</span>] <span class="greekheb">τῆς δικαιοσύνης λαμβάνοντες</span> we again touch experience, and an empirical condition is attached to the abstract universality suggested by <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>. The abundance of the grace and of (the gift which consists in) righteousness has to be received by faith. But when by faith a connection is formed with Christ, the consequences of that connection, as more agreeable to what we know of God’s nature, can be more surely counted upon than the consequences of our natural connection with Adam. Part of the contrast is marked by the change from “death reigned” to “<span class="ital">we</span> shall reign <span class="ital">in life</span>,” not “life shall reign in or over us”. The future in <span class="greekheb">βασιλεύσουσιν</span> is no doubt logical, but it refers nevertheless to the consummation of redemption in the Messianic kingdom in the world to come. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a> f., <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2 Timothy 2:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>, &c.] “For” refers mainly to the last clause of <a href="/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>. The contrast of “one” and “many” is now dropped, but we find another contrast; that between the legal results of evil and the overflowing results of Divine goodness, the goodness which grants acquittal to the “ungodly.” Q. d., “The free gift is a gift indeed, liberal and glorious: <span class="ital">for</span> if the result of Adam’s one sin was the reign of death, far more amply shall the result of God’s grace be the reign of the justified in life!”—In this verse the “glory to be revealed,” as a <span class="ital">necessary sequel</span> of justification, first distinctly appears.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by one man’s offence</span>] A better reading gives <span class="bld">in one offence</span>. The First Sin was the occasion “<span class="ital">in</span>” (or <span class="ital">on</span>) <span class="ital">which</span> death acquired its tyranny over man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by one</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">through,</span> or <span class="bld">by, the one</span>. So just below. See on <a href="/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they which receive</span>] From time to time; a continuous process, as regards successive generations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">abundance</span>] The word implies the <span class="ital">necessary</span> fulness of a gift of Divine love.

What is “given” is a <span class="ital">standing of acceptance in the eye of the Law</span>. And the Law, as such, accepts <span class="ital">only</span> on the ground of “righteousness,” freedom from guilt. How such freedom from guilt is attained is another question: in the present case, it is attained as “a gift,” given by “the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall reign in life</span>] Amply reversing the “reign” of death over them. Probably the chief idea is of a <span class="ital">triumph</span>, full and lasting, <span class="ital">over death</span>. Cp. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-55.htm" title="O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?...">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>, an instructive parallel. But no doubt the words refer beyond this to all the <span class="ital">majesty</span> of the coming “glory” of the justified, figured elsewhere by the “crown” of life, righteousness, or glory; and by the “throne.” See the marvellous union of <span class="ital">service and royalty</span>, <a href="/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>.—“<span class="ital">Life</span>” is here the future, heavenly life; life in its full sense. Cp. <a href="/context/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire....">Matthew 18:8-9</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by one</span>, &c.] Lit. <span class="bld">through the One, Jesus Christ</span>.
