Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them. Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observances without being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail. Attempts for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians would be useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes of words. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdain and blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare I disown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise his weak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulous believer find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, without regarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when we take upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, which are out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much the same. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ's coming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is not enough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary that it be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against a doubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standard of truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. Thus Christians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful matters of no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all our mercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For one believeth - This was the case with the Gentiles in general, who had none of the scruples of the Jew about the propriety of eating certain kinds of meat. Many of the converts who had been Jews might also have had the same view as the apostle Paul evidently had while the great mass of Jewish converts might have cherished these scruples.<p>May eat all things - That is, he will not be restrained by any scruples about the lawfulness of certain meats, etc.<p>Another who is weak - There is reference here, doubt less, to the Jewish convert. The apostle admits that he was "weak," that is, not fully established in the views of Christian liberty. The question with the Jew doubtless was, whether it was lawful to eat the meat which was offered in sacrifice to idols. In those sacrifices a part only of the animal was offered, and the remainder was eaten by the worshippers, or offered for sale in the market like other meat. It became an inquiry whether it was lawful to eat this meat; and the question in the mind of a Jew would arise from the express command of his Law; <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>. This question the apostle discussed and settled in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20-32</a>, which see. In that place the general principle is laid down, that it was lawful to partake of that meat as a man would of any other, "unless it was expressly pointed out to him as having been sacrificed to idols, and unless his partaking of it would be considered as countenancing the idolators in their worship;" <a href="/romans/14-28.htm">Romans 14:28</a>. But with this principle many Jewish converts might not have been acquainted; or what is quite as probable, they might not have been disposed to admit its propriety.<p>Eateth herbs - Herbs or "vegetables" only; does not partake of meat at all, for "fear" of eating that, inadvertently, which had been offered to idols. The Romans abounded in sacrifices to idols; and it would not be easy to be certain that meat which was offered in the market, or on the table of a friend, had not been offered in this manner. To avoid the possibility of partaking of it, even "ignorantly," they chose to eat no meat at all. The scruples of the Jews on the subject might have arisen in part from the fact that sins of "ignorance" among them subjected them to certain penalties; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2-3</a>, etc.; <a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-29</a>. Josephus says (Life, Section 3) that in his time there were certain priests of his acquaintance who "supported themselves with figs and nuts." These priests had been sent to Rome to be tried on some charge before Caesar: and it is probable that they abstained from meat because it might have been offered to idols. It is expressly declared of Daniel when in Babylon, that he lived on pulse and water, that he might not "defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. one believeth that he may eat all things&#8212;See Ac 10:16.<p>another, who is weak, eateth herbs&#8212;restricting himself probably to a vegetable diet, for fear of eating what might have been offered to idols, and so would be unclean.

This use of <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> shows that <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> to Paul was essentially an ethical principle; the man who was strong in it had moral independence, courage, and originality. <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ ἀσθενῶν λάχανα ἐσθίει</span>: it is impossible to suppose that Paul here is “writing quite generally”; he must have had a motive for saying what he does, and it can only be found in the fact that he knew there were Christians in Rome who abstained from the use of flesh.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>2. This difference may be explained by the different quality and aspect of the controversies. In Galatia the question was of primary principle; at Rome and Corinth it was, on the whole, of secondary practice. <span class="ital">How to be justified before God</span> was the Galatian problem. <span class="ital">How the justified should live</span> was, at least in the main, the problem at Rome and Corinth. For there is no proof that the “weak brethren” differed from the “strong” on the great principle of Justification by Faith. Their error was that the path of duty, laid before the justified, included a moral obligation on the obedient children of God to abstain from certain sorts of food and to keep the Mosaic feasts. <span class="ital">All</span> the Roman Christians agreed that the justified <span class="ital">must not</span> lie nor steal; but the “weak brethren” held that, in the same way, they <span class="ital">must not</span> taste “unclean” food, nor neglect the festivals. The error in Galatia affected the very principle of the work and grace of Christ; the error at Rome did not, at all necessarily, do so. St Paul was thus perfectly consistent in writing <a href="/context/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:...">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, and <a href="/context/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations....">Romans 14:1-10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">believeth that he may eat</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">believeth to eat;</span> i.e. <span class="ital">has faith which leads him to</span> see that sorts of food are no longer a matter of religious scruple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who is weak</span>] i.e. in his faith.
