These are crowned in the confirmed Christian by that feeling of subdued and chastened exultation which is wrought in Him by the presence in his heart or constant influence of the Holy Spirit.<p>It is remarkable how, with all the wide difference in terminology between the writings of St. Paul and the Gospels, they yet come round to the very same point. The “kingdom of God,” as here described, is exactly what we should gather from the fuller and more detailed sayings of our Lord. “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;” “The kingdom of God is within you;” “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation;” “If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light;” “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness;” “Blessed are the peacemakers;” “Rejoice and be exceeding glad.”<p>It has not been beyond the power of heathen or even Christian philosophers, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as Marcus Aurelius, to arrive at the conception of righteousness and peaceableness as duties to be observed and striven after. The peculiarity of Christianity consists in the unity which it gives to these attributes as naturally flowing from a spring of deep religious emotion, and from the finish and perfection which it adds to them by the introduction of that third term, “joy in the Holy Ghost.” Many individuals have shown, and still show, with greater or less approximation, what the Christian type should be, but the great and only perfect Exemplar is Jesus Himself, and that less, perhaps, in the later portion of His career, when He was fulfilling that other side of His mission, to “bear the sins of many” as the Saviour of mankind, than in the earlier untroubled phase which finds expression in the Sermon on the Mount. This is in closest contact with the normal life of men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/romans/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost....">Romans 14:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the kingdom of God </span>— Into which we enter by believing in Christ, and becoming his subjects, or which thereby enters into us, and is set up in our hearts, namely, true religion; <span class="ital">is not </span>— Does not consist in; <span class="ital">meat and drink </span>— Or in any ceremonial observances whatever; <span class="ital">but righteousness </span>— The righteousness of faith, love, and obedience; or justification, sanctification, and a holy conduct; see notes on <a href="/romans/5-21.htm" title="That as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 5:21</a>; <a href="/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>; <span class="ital">peace </span>— With God, peace of conscience, and tranquillity of mind, the consequence of these three branches of righteousness; <span class="ital">and joy in the Holy Ghost </span>— Joy arising from a sense of the forgiveness of our sins; (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a>;) and of the favour of God; (<a href="/context/psalms/4-6.htm" title="There be many that say, Who will show us any good?

Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing a soul to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ deny himself for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we deny ourselves for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinder ungoverned tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them any occasion. We must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do, when our doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to be evil spoken of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable and selfish manner. As we value the reputation of the good we profess and practise, let us seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness, peace, and joy, are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our great concern is to appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit of his grace; for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our brethren, it is to live in peace, and love, and charity with them; following peace with all men. As to ourselves, it is joy in the Holy Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father, and heaven as their expected home. Regard to Christ in doing our duties, alone can make them acceptable. Those are most pleasing to God that are best pleased with him; and they abound most in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. They are approved by wise and good men; and the opinion of others is not to be regarded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the kingdom of God - For an explanation of this phrase, see the note at <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>. Here it means that the uniquenesses of the kingdom of God, or of the Church of Christ on earth, do not consist in observing the distinctions between meats and drinks, it was true that by these things the Jews had been particularly characterized, but the Christian church was to be distinguished in a different manner.<p>Is not - Does not consist in, or is not distinguished by.<p>Meat and drink - In observing distinctions between different kinds of food, or making such observances a matter of conscience as the Jews did. Moses did not prescribe any particular drink or prohibit any, but the Nazarites abstained from wine and all kinds of strong liquors; and it is not improbable that the Jews had invented some distinctions on this subject which they judged to be of importance. Hence, it is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "Let no man judge you in meat or in drink;" compare <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>.<p>But righteousness - This word here means "virtue, integrity," a faithful discharge of all the duties which we owe to God or to our fellow-men. It means that the Christian must so live as to be appropriately denominated a righteous man, and not a man whose whole attention is absorbed by the mere ceremonies and outward forms of religion. To produce this, we are told, was the main design, and the principal teaching of the gospel; <a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>; Compare <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>. Thus, it is said <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a>, "Everyone that doeth righteousness is born of God;" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>, "Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God;" compare <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-34.htm">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>. He that is a righteous man, whose characteristic it is to lead a holy life, is a Christian. If his great aim is to do the will of God, and if he seeks to discharge with fidelity all his duties to God and man, he is renewed. On that righteousness he will not "depend" for salvation <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8-9</a>, but he will regard this character and this disposition as evidence that he is a Christian, and that the Lord Jesus is made unto him" wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption;" <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>.<p>And peace - This word, in this place, does not refer to the internal "peace" and happiness which the Christian has in his own mind (compare the notes at <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>); but to peace or concord in opposition to "contention" among brethren. The tendency and design of the kingdom of God is to produce concord and love, and to put an end to alienation and strife. Even though, therefore, there might be ground for the opinions which some cherished in regard to rites, yet it was of more importance to maintain peace than obstinately to press those matters at the expense of strife and contention. That the tendency of the gospel is to promote peace, and to induce people to lay aside all causes of contention and bitter strife, is apparent from the following passages of the New Testament; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>; <a href="/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31-32</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>. This is the second evidence of piety on which Christians should examine their hearts - a disposition to promote the peace of Jerusalem; <a href="/psalms/122-6.htm">Psalm 122:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11</a>. A contentious, quarrelsome spirit; a disposition to magnify trifles; to make the Shibboleth of party an occasion of alienation, and heart-burning, and discord; to sow dissensions on account of unimportant points of doctrine or of discipline, is full proof that there is no attachment to Him who is the Prince of peace. Such a disposition does infinite dishonor to the cause of religion, and perhaps has done more to retard its progress than all other causes put together. Contentions commonly arise from some small matter in doctrine, in dress, in ceremonies; and often the smaller the matter the more fierce the controversy, until he spirit of religion disappears, and desolation comes over the face of Zion:<p>"The Spirit, like a peaceful dove,<p>Flies from the realms of noise and strife."<p>And joy - This refers, doubtless, to the "personal" happiness produced in the mind by the influence of the gospel; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>.<p>In the Holy Ghost - Produced "by" the Holy Spirit; <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. For the kingdom of God&#8212;or, as we should say, Religion; that is, the proper business and blessedness for which Christians are formed into a community of renewed men in thorough subjection to God (compare 1Co 4:20).<p>is not meat and drink&#8212;"eating and drinking"<p>but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost&#8212;a beautiful and comprehensive division of living Christianity. The first&#8212;"righteousness"&#8212;has respect to God, denoting here "rectitude," in its widest sense (as in Mt 6:33); the second&#8212;"peace"&#8212;has respect to our neighbors, denoting "concord" among brethren (as is plain from Ro 14:19; compare Eph 4:3; Col 3:14, 15); the third&#8212;"joy in the Holy Ghost"&#8212;has respect to ourselves. This phrase, "joy in the Holy Ghost," represents Christians as so thinking and feeling under the workings of the Holy Ghost, that their joy may be viewed rather as that of the blessed Agent who inspires it than their own (compare 1Th 1:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse contains a new argument to persuade Christians not to strive about meats, or such like things; and that is, that the <span class="ital">kingdom of God</span> doth not consist in these, but in weightier matters.

By <span class="ital">peace, </span> some think, he means peace with God, or peace of conscience; others, that he rather means peace with men; or, if you will, peaceableness, or Christian concord and unity. This suits best with what follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/14-19.htm" title="Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.">Romans 14:19</a></span>, and it is often commended to us in Scripture.

Neither the kingdom of glory, nor the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints in the other world, is attained to by any such things; for neither eating and drinking, nor not eating and drinking, can recommend to the divine favour, or give a meetness for heaven, or a right unto it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>, nor does the kingdom of grace, the principle of grace, lie in such things, nor in anything that is external; nor does the Gospel, or Gospel church state, which frequently go under this name of the kingdom of God, consist of such things as the ceremonial and the legal dispensation did, but the Gospel and the dispensation of grace are opposed unto them; see <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>. <p>But righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The kingdom of glory, which is the kingdom of God, because of his preparing, giving, calling to, and putting into the possession of, is attained unto by righteousness; not the righteousness of men, but the righteousness of Christ imputed by God, and received by faith; and through peace made by the blood of Christ, and rejoicing in him, without having any confidence in the flesh, which is a branch of the Spirit's grace in regeneration. The kingdom of grace, or the governing principle of grace in the soul, and which is of God's implanting there, lies in righteousness and true holiness, in which the new man is created; in truth and uprightness in the inward parts, where the laws of God are put and written; and in peace of conscience, arising from the blood and righteousness of Christ; and in that spiritual joy and comfort the Holy Ghost produces, by leading to a sight of Christ, and an interest in him and his atonement. The Gospel, which gives an account both of the kingdom of grace and of glory, reveals the righteousness of Christ, and teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present evil world: it is a publication of peace by the blood of Christ; it calls men to peace, to cultivate peace one among another, and to seek those things which make for it; and when it comes in power, is attended with joy in the Holy Ghost, and is the means of increasing it; and this is another reason, persuading to Christian forbearance, in the use of things indifferent. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{17}</span> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span><p>(17) A general reason, and the foundation of the entire argument: the kingdom of heaven consists not in these outward things, but in the study of righteousness, and peace, and comfort of the Holy Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>.

This use of the expression, however, does not exclude another, which is more akin to what we find in the Gospels, and regards the Kingdom of God as in some sense also present: we have examples of this here, and in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1 Corinthians 4:20</a> : perhaps also in <a href="/acts/20-25.htm" title="And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.">Acts 20:25</a>. No doubt for Paul the transcendent associations would always cling to the name, so that we should lose a great deal of what it meant for him if we translated it by “the Christian religion” or any such form of words.

The true answer must be that Paul did not thus distinguish ethical and religious: the words are religious primarily, but the ethical meaning is so far from being excluded by the religious that it is secured by it, and by it alone. That the religious import ought to be put in the forefront is shown by <span class="greekheb">χαρὰ ἐν πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. which is a grace, not a virtue.

This radical meaning branches into different references; and thus the Kingdom may mean (according to the varying contexts) (1) the state of grace in this life; (2) the state of glory in the life to come; (3) the revealed truths which are the laws and charter of the kingdom; (4) the dignity and privilege (here or hereafter) of the subjects of the kingdom.
