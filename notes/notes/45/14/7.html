No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For none of us ... - Whether by nature Jews or Gentiles. In the great principles of religion we are now united. Where there was evidence of a sincere desire to do the will of God there should be charitable feeling, through there was difference of opinion and judgment in many smaller matters. The meaning of the expression is, that no Christian lives to gratify his own inclinations or appetites. He makes it his great aim to do the will of God; to subordinate all his desires to his Law and gospel; and though, therefore, one should eat flesh, and should feel at liberty to devote to common employments time that another deemed sacred, yet it should not be uncharitably set down as a desire to indulge his sensual appetites, or to become rich. Another motive "may be" supposed, and where there is not positive "proof" to the contrary, "should be" supposed; see the beautiful illustration of this in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a>. To live "to ourselves" is to make it the great object to become rich or honored, or to indulge in the ease, comfort, and pleasures of life. These are the aim of all people but Christians; and in nothing else do Christians more differ from the world than in this; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>; <a href="/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>; <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>. On no point does it become Christians more to examine themselves than on this. To "live to ourselves" is an evidence that we are strangers to piety. And if it be the great motive of our lives to live at ease <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> - to gratify the flesh, to gain property, or to be distinguished in places of fashion and amusement - it is evidence that we know nothing of the power of that gospel which teaches us "to deny ourselves, and take up our cross daily.<p>No man - No "one," the same Greek word &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;  oudeis which is used in the former part of the verse. The word is used only in reference to "Christians" here, and makes no affirmation about other people.<p>Dieth to himself - See <a href="/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8</a>. This expression is used to denote the "universality" or the "totality" with which Christians belong to God. Every thing is done and suffered with reference to his will. In our conduct, in our property, in our trials, in our death, we are "his;" to be disposed of as he shall please. In the grave, and in the future world, we shall be equally his. As this is the great principle on which "all" Christians live and act, we should be kind and tender toward them, though in some respects they differ from us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.

That is, none of us believers; others may, but these do not, at least they ought not, nor do they when under the influence of the grace of God: they do not live, neither to righteous, nor to sinful self; they do not live upon their duties and services; nor do they ascribe their life, righteousness, and salvation to them; nor do they live to their own lusts, or make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof, and much less to the lusts and wills of others: <p>and no man dieth to himself; every man dies, and must, or undergo a change equivalent to death; believers die as well as others, not eternally, or the second death, but corporeally, or a temporal death, but not to themselves; as they do not seek their own will and pleasure, and profit in life, so neither in death; they do not die to their own advantage only; death is gain unto them, it frees thema from all their sorrows, toil, and labours, and introduces them into the presence of Christ, and the enjoyment of everlasting happiness; but this is not all their death issues in, but also in the glory of Christ: moreover, no man has the power over life or death; as his life is not from himself, he has no power to lengthen or shorten it, nor to hinder or hasten death; this belongs to another Lord and master, whom life and death are both to subserve.

The truth which has been affirmed in regard to the Christian’s use of food, and observance or non-observance of days, is here based on a larger truth of which it is a part. His whole life belongs not to himself, but to his Lord. “No one of us liveth to himself,” does not mean, “every man’s conduct affects others for better or worse, whether he will or not”; it means, “no Christian is his own end in life; what is always present to his mind, as the rule of his conduct, is the will and the interest of his Lord”. The same holds of his dying. He does not choose either the time or the mode of it, like a Roman Stoic, to please himself. He dies when the Lord will, as the Lord will, and even by his death glorifies God. In <a href="/romans/14-14.htm" title="I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.">Romans 14:14</a> ff.

This (ideally) determines everything, alike in life and death; and all that is determined by it is right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">For none of us</span>] Us the justified, the “sons of God.”—Here (and in <a href="/context/romans/14-8.htm" title="For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's....">Romans 14:8-9</a>,) St Paul states the great principle on which the practice in question is, or should be, based.

To “live to himself” is here, manifestly, not so much to live a “<span class="ital">selfish</span>” life as to live a life in which the mere dictates of conscience and will are the supreme rule, irrespective of Christ.
