Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them. Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observances without being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail. Attempts for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians would be useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes of words. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdain and blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare I disown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise his weak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulous believer find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, without regarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when we take upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, which are out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much the same. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ's coming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is not enough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary that it be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against a doubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standard of truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. Thus Christians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful matters of no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all our mercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that regardeth - Greek, "Thinketh of;" or pays attention to; that is, he that "observes" it as a festival, or as holy time.<p>The day - Any of the days under discussion; the days that the Jews kept as religious occasions.<p>Regardeth unto the Lord - Regards it as "holy," or as set apart to the service of God.

From this passage about the observance of days, Alford unhappily infers that such language could not have been used if the sabbath law had been in force under the Gospel in any form. Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely because it was observed under the Mosaic economy. And certainly, if the sabbath was more ancient than Judaism; if, even under Judaism, it was enshrined among the eternal sanctities of the Decalogue, uttered, as no other parts of Judaism were, amidst the terrors of Sinai; and if the Lawgiver Himself said of it when on earth, "The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day" (see Mr 2:28)&#8212;it will be hard to show that the apostle must have meant it to be ranked by his readers among those vanished Jewish festival days, which only "weakness" could imagine to be still in force&#8212;a weakness which those who had more light ought, out of love, merely to bear with.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse you have a reason why Christians should not censure one another, upon an account of different opinions and practices, because they have all the same end and scope, which is the pleasing and glorifying of God.

The apostle strengthens the above advice with this reason, because what is done both by one and the other, is done unto the Lord. The weak brother that esteems one day above another, and regards the passover, pentecost, and feast of tabernacles, a new moon, or a seventh day sabbath, does it in obedience to the commands of the Lord, which he thinks are still binding, not knowing that they are disannulled by Christ; and the worship performed by him on any of those days is done in the name and strength of the Lord, with a view to his glory, and as believing it was pleasing in his sight; and whether he is right or wrong, it is to the Lord he does it, and to his own master he stands or falls. The following clause is omitted in the Alexandrian copy and some others, and in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, but is in most Greek copies, and retained in the Syriac and Arabic versions. <p>And he that regardeth not the day, the Lord he doth not regard it; believing it is the will of the Lord, that all distinction of days should cease; and that the law of commandments contained in ordinances, respecting such Jewish days, is abolished by the Lord Jesus Christ; and that it is to the honour the Lord not to observe them: for to regard the days of the feast of tabernacles, is tacitly to say, that the Word has not tabernacled among us; and to observe he days of the passover, is virtually to deny that our passover is sacrificed for us; and to keep the day of Pentecost, is all one as to affirm, that the firstfruits of the Spirit have not been given; and to regard a new moon, is in effect to say, that the church has not received evangelical light from Christ, the sun of righteousness; and to keep a seventh day sabbath, is a strong insinuation, as if Christ the true sabbath, in whom we have our spiritual and eternal rest, is not come; however, it is to the Lord that the stronger brother and more confirmed believer disregards any of those days; and it is to his own master he stands or falls, nor is he to be judged of man's judgment: and the same is the case of the eater, or non-eater of meats forbidden by the law: <p>he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks. The man that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any difference; and when he eats or drinks at any time, it is all to the glory of God; which is a clear case, by his giving God thanks, as becomes him, for the food he eats: he acknowledges that these are the creatures of God, and his gifts to him; he gives him thanks for the right he has given him to eat of them, and for taking away the distinction of meats, and giving him the free use of his creatures; and the more thankful he is when he considers how unworthy he is of the least of these mercies: and <p>he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth, or, and giveth God thanks. The man that is weak in faith, that eateth not food forbidden by the law, abstains from such food, purely on account of the Lord, in obedience to his will, and with a view to his glory, supposing such a law to be in full force; and is thankful to God for the herbs he allows him to eat, or for other food not forbidden by the law: and therefore since each party shows such a religious concern for the glory of the Lord, the apostle argues they ought to be easy one with another. The Alexandrian copy reads, "and giveth the Lord thanks". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/romans/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> He that <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> regardeth the day, regardeth <i>it</i> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Lord he doth not regard <i>it</i>. He that <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> eateth, eateth to the Lord, <span class="cverse3">{9}</span> for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span><p>(8) A reason taken from the nature of indifferent things, which a man may do with good conscience, and omit: for seeing that the difference of days and meats was appointed by God, how could those who as yet did not understand the abrogation of the law, and yet otherwise acknowledge Christ as their Saviour, with good conscience neglect that which they knew was commanded by God? And on the other hand, those who knew the benefit of Christ in this behalf, did with good conscience neither observe days nor meats: therefore, says the apostle in verse ten, Let not the strong condemn the weak for these things, seeing that the weak brethren are brethren nonetheless. Ro 14:10 Now if any man would apply this doctrine to our times and ages, let him know that the apostle speaks of indifferent things, and that those who thought them not to be indifferent, had a basis in the law, and were deceived by simple ignorance, and not from malice (for to such the apostle does not yield, no not for a moment) nor superstition, but by a religious fear of God.<p>(e) Precisely observes.<p>(f) God will judge whether he does well or not: and therefore you should rather strive about this, how every one of you will be considered by God, than to think upon other men's doings.<p>(g) He that makes no difference between meats.<p>(9) So the apostle shows that he speaks of the faithful, both strong and weak: but what if we have to deal with the unfaithful? Then we must take heed of two things, as also is declared in the epistle to the Corinthians. The first is that we do not consider their superstition as something indifferent, as they did who sat down to eat meat in idol's temples: the second is that then also when the matter is indifferent (as to buy a thing offered to idols, in the butcher's store, and to eat it at home or at a private meal) we do not wound the conscience of our weak brother.<p>(h) He that does not touch meats which he considers to be unclean by the law.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/romans/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/romans/14-6.htm" title="He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it.

The clause <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ μὴ φρονῶν</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐ φρονεῖ</span> is omitted by most editors, but its absence from most MSS. might still be due to <span class="ital">homœoteleuton</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖ</span>: thanksgiving to God consecrates <span class="ital">every</span> meal, whether it be the ascetic one of him who abstains from wine and flesh (<span class="greekheb">ὁ μὴ ἐσθίων</span>), or the more generous one of him who uses both (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐσθίων</span>): <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/27-35.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.">Acts 27:35</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm" title="For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>, <a href="/context/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth....">1 Timothy 4:3-5</a>. The thanksgiving shows that in either case the Christian is acting <span class="greekheb">εἰς δόξαν θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>), and therefore that the Lord’s interest is safe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">regardeth</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">thinketh, mindeth</span>. Same word as e. g. <a href="/romans/8-5.htm" title="For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.">Romans 8:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the Lord</span>] i.e. the Lord <span class="ital">Christ</span>, “the Lord of the dead and living” (<a href="/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>). The word thus used is a good implicit proof of St Paul’s view of the supreme dignity of Messiah; especially when we find him just below writing, in the same connexion, “he giveth God thanks.” It would indeed be unsafe to say that in that clause “<span class="ital">God</span>” means specially or exclusively “<span class="ital">Christ</span>.” But the two words are so used that no such gulf as that between Creator and Creature can possibly divide them.—“<span class="ital">Unto the Lord:</span>”—i.e., as one who not only <span class="ital">is</span> responsible to Him, but <span class="ital">owns</span> that he is. This seems to be required by the use made of the fact of <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span> just below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he that regardeth not—not regard it</span>] Documentary evidence appears to exclude this part of the verse.

He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.">Romans 14:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐχαριστεῖ γὰρ</span>—<span class="greekheb">καὶ εὐχαριστεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">for he gives thanks—and gives thanks</span>) Thanksgiving sanctifies all actions, however outwardly different, which do not weaken it, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm" title="For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm" title=" Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a>. The, <span class="ital">For</span>, however, has greater force than <span class="ital">and</span>, as thanksgiving is more connected with eating, than with abstinence from eating; and in him, who <span class="ital">eats</span>, there are both the fruits and the criterion, and in some respects the ground of faith, even of that faith, of which we have an account at <a href="/romans/14-22.htm" title="Have you faith? have it to yourself before God.

Both parties are supposed to be equally desirous of serving God. The eater of whatsoever is set before him is so, as is shown by his thanking God for it - observe "for he giveth," etc. - and no creature of God can be polluting "if received with thanksgiving" (<a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>); the abstainer gives thanks too; and so his dinner of herbs is also hallowed to him. (Though it is not necessary to confine the thought to the practice of saying grace before meat, this is doubtless in view as expressing the asserted thankfulness. For proof of the custom, cf. <a href="/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4, 5</a>.) The general principle on which, in eating and drinking, as in all beside, Christians are of necessity supposed to act, and which both parties are to be credited with desiring to carry out, is set forth in vers. 7, 8, 9, which follow. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that regardeth not - doth not regard it<p>Omit. </body></html>
