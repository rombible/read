When to awake; Now; and to awake out of the sleep of carnal security, sloth, and negligence; out of the sleep of spiritual death, and out of the sleep of spiritual deadness. Considering the time; a busy time; a perilous time. Also the salvation nigh at hand. Let us mind our way, and mend our pace, we are nearer our journey's end. Also to make ourselves ready. The night is far spent, the day is at hand; therefore it is time to dress ourselves. Observe what we must put off; clothes worn in the night. Cast off the sinful works of darkness. Observe what we must put on; how we should dress our souls. Put on the armour of light. A Christian must reckon himself undressed, if unarmed. The graces of the Spirit are this armour, to secure the soul from Satan's temptations, and the assaults of this present evil world. Put on Christ; that includes all. Put on righteousness of Christ, for justification. Put on the Spirit and grace of Christ, for sanctification. The Lord Jesus Christ must be put on as Lord to rule you as Jesus to save you; and in both, as Christ anointed and appointed by the Father to this ruling, saving work. And how to walk. When we are up and ready, we are not to sit still, but to appear abroad; let us walk. Christianity teaches us how to walk so as to please God, who ever sees us. Walk honestly as in the day; avoiding the works of darkness. Where there are riot and drunkenness, there usually are chambering and wantonness, and strife and envy. Solomon puts these all together, Pr 23:29-35. See what provision to make. Our great care must be to provide for our souls: but must we take no care about our bodies? Yes; but two things are forbidden. Perplexing ourselves with anxious, encumbering care; and indulging ourselves in irregular desires. Natural wants are to be answered, but evil appetites must be checked and denied. To ask meat for our necessities, is our duty, we are taught to pray for daily bread; but to ask meat for our lusts, is provoking God, Ps 78:18.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But put ye on - Compare <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>. The word rendered "put ye on" is the same used in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>, and is commonly employed in reference to "clothing" or "apparel." The phrase to "put on" a person, which seems a harsh expression in our language, was one not infrequently used by Greek writers, and means to imbibe his principles, to imitate his example, to copy his spirit, to become like him. Thus, in Dionysius Halicarnassus the expression occurs, "having put on or clothed themselves with Tarquin;" i. e., they imitated the example and morals of Tarquin. So Lucian says, "having put on Pythagoras;" having received him as a teacher and guide. So the Greek writers speak of putting on Plato, Socrates, etc. meaning to take them as instructors, to follow them as disciples. (See Schleusner.) Thus, to put on the Lord Jesus means to take him as a pattern and guide, to imitate his example, to obey his precepts, to become like him, etc. In "all" respects the Lord Jesus was unlike what had been specified in the previous verse. He was temperate, chaste, pure, peaceable, and meek; and to "put him on" was to imitate him in these respects; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>.<p>And make not provision - The word "provision" here is what is used to denote "provident care," or preparation for future needs. It means that we should not make it an object to gratify our lusts, or study to do this by laying up anything beforehand with reference to this design.<p>For the flesh - The word "flesh" is used here evidently to denote the corrupt propensities of the body, or those which he had specified in <a href="/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>.<p>To fulfil the lusts thereof - With reference to its corrupt desires. The gratification of the flesh was the main object among the Romans. Living in luxury and licentiousness, they made it their great object of study to multiply and prolong the means of licentious indulgence. In respect to this, Christians were to be a separate people, and to show that they were influenced by a higher and purer desire than this grovelling propensity to minister to sensual gratification. It is right, it is a Christian duty, to labor to make provision for all the real needs of life. But the real wants are few; and with a heart disposed to be pure and temperate, the necessary wants of life are easily satisfied; and the mind may be devoted to higher and purer purposes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

As it makes war directly against no specific forms of government, so it directly recommends none. While its holy and benign principles secure the ultimate abolition of all iniquitous government, the reverence which it teaches for magistracy, under whatever form, as a divine institution, secures the loyalty and peaceableness of its disciples, amid all the turbulence and distractions of civil society, and makes it the highest interest of all states to welcome it within their pale, as in this as well as every other sense&#8212;"the salt of the earth, the light of the world" (Ro 13:1-5). (2) Christianity is the grand specific for the purification and elevation of all the social relations; inspiring a readiness to discharge all obligations, and most of all, implanting in its disciples that love which secures all men against injury from them, inasmuch as it is the fulfilling of the law (Ro 13:6-10). (3) The rapid march of the kingdom of God, the advanced stage of it at which we have arrived, and the ever-nearing approach of the perfect day&#8212;nearer to every believer the longer he lives&#8212;should quicken all the children of light to redeem the time, and, seeing that they look for such things, to be diligent, that they may be found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless (2Pe 3:14). (4) In virtue of "the expulsive power of a new and more powerful affection," the great secret of persevering holiness in all manner of conversation will be found to be "Christ IN US, the hope of glory" (Col 1:27), and Christ ON US, as the character in which alone we shall be able to shine before men (2Co 3:8) (Ro 13:14).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ; </span> he exhorted, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a></span>, to <span class="ital">put on the armour of light; </span> now, to <span class="ital">put on Jesus Christ.</span> This is necessary, for though grace may help to defend, yet it is Christ and his righteousness only that can cover us (as a garment doth our nakedness) in the sight of God.

As a man puts on his clothes when he rises in the morning: the righteousness of Christ is compared to a garment, it is the best robe, it is fine linen, clean and white, and change of raiment; which being put on by the Father's gracious act of imputation, covers the sins and deformities of his people, defends them from divine justice, secures them from wrath to come, and renders them beautiful and acceptable in his sight: which righteousness being revealed from faith to faith, is received by faith, and made use of as a proper dress to appear in before God; and may be daily said to be put on by the believer, as often as he makes use of it, and pleads it with God as his justifying righteousness, which should be continually: moreover, to put on Christ, and which indeed seems to be the true sense of the phrase here, is not only to exercise faith on him as the Lord our righteousness, and to make a profession of his name, but to imitate him in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; to walk as he walked, and as we have him for an example, in love, meekness, patience, humility, and holiness: <p>and make not provision for the flesh; the body: not but that due care is to be taken of it, both for food and clothing; and for its health, and the continuance and preservation of it by all lawful methods; but not so as <p>to fulfil the lusts thereof; to indulge and gratify them, by luxury and uncleanness: it is a saying of Hillell (k),    "he that increases flesh, increases worms"; the sense his commentators (l) give of it is, that <p>"he that increases by eating and drinking, until he becomes fat and fleshy, increases for himself worms in the grave:'' <p>the design of the sentence is, that voluptuous men, who care for nothing else but the flesh, should consider, that ere long they will be a repast for worms: we should not provide, or be caterers for the flesh; and, by pampering it, stir up and satisfy its corrupt inclinations and desires. <p>(k) Pirke Abot, c. 2. sect. 7.

The <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> is here not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> (as is frequently assumed; see on the other hand Calovius and Reiche), but is that which composes the material substance of man, as the source and seat of sensuous and sinful desires, in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of man with the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>. Paul <span class="ital">purposely chose</span> the expression, because in respect of care for the <span class="ital">body</span> he wishes to present the point of view that this care nourishes and attends to the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, and one must therefore be on one’s guard against caring for the latter <span class="ital">in such measure</span> that the lusts, which have their seat in the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, are excited and strengthened.

In substance and in moral principle, the <span class="greekheb">ἀφειδία σώματος</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>) is different from this. Chrysostom aptly observes: <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ γὰρ οὐ τὸ πίνειν ἐκώλυσεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τὸ μεθύειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ τὸ γαμεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀσελγεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὕτως οὐδὲ τὸ προνοεῖν τῆς σαρκὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τὸ εἰς ἐπιθυμίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἷον τὸ τὴν χρείαν ὑπερβαίνειν</span>. Moreover it is clear in itself, that Paul has added the second half of <a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a> in view of what is to be handled in chap. 14, and has thereby prepared the way for a transition to the latter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἐνδύσασθε τὸν Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ</span> emphasises the contrast between the true Christian life and that which has just been described. The Christian puts on the Lord Jesus Christ, according to Paul’s teaching, in baptism (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>), as the solemn deliberate act in which he identifies himself, by faith, with Christ in His death and resurrection (chap. <a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a>). But the Christian life is not exhausted in this act, which is rather the starting-point for a putting on of Christ in the ethical sense, a “clothing of the soul in the moral disposition and habits of Christ” (Gifford); or as the Apostle himself puts it in <a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>, a <span class="ital">reckoning</span> of ourselves to be dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Every time we perform an ethical act of this kind we put on the Lord Jesus Christ more fully. But the principle of all such acts is the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us (chaps. 6–8), and it is the essential antagonism of the spirit to the flesh which determines the form of the last words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τῆς σαρκὸς πρόνοιαν μὴ ποιεῖσθε εἰς ἐπιθυμίας</span>. It is to inquire too curiously if we inquire whether <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> here is used in the physiological sense = the body, or in the moral sense = <span class="ital">libidinosa caro</span> (as Fritzsche argues): the significance of the word in Paul depends on the fact that in experience these two meanings are indubitably if not inseparably related. Taking the flesh as it is, forethought or provision for it—an interest in it which consults for it, and makes it an object—can only have one end, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, its <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίαι</span>. All such interest therefore is forbidden as inconsistent with putting on the Lord Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/romans/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">But put ye on</span>, &c.] For similar language see <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>; (where Baptism is to be viewed in its ideal, as involving and sealing the acceptance and confession of Christ.)

In his <span class="ital">Confessions</span> (VIII. 12) he records how, at a time of great moral conflict, he was strangely impelled by a voice, perhaps the cry of children at play, (“<span class="ital">Take and read, take and read</span>,”) to open again the Epistles of St Paul (<span class="ital">codicem Apostoli</span>) which he had recently been reading. “I read in silence the first place on which my eyes fell; <span class="ital">Not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in its lusts</span>. I neither cared, nor needed, to read further. At the close of the sentence, as if a ray of certainty were poured into my heart, the clouds of hesitation all fled at once.”—The following words, <span class="ital">But him that is weak in faith receive ye</span>, were pointed out to him just after by his friend Alypius, to whom Augustine shewed the present verse. Augustine was at the time so slightly read in the Scriptures that he was not aware (he says) of this context till Alypius, with an application to himself, drew his attention to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/romans/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν</span>) Here is summarily contained <span class="ital">all the light and power</span> of the New Testament, as it is the whole of salvation [<span class="ital">everything that is wrong being excluded</span>.—V. g.] <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν</span>, <span class="ital">Jesus Christ</span>) ch. <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?...">Romans 6:3-4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σαρκὸς</span>, <span class="ital">of the flesh</span>) This has respect to ch. 7 and 8.—<span class="greekheb">πρόνοιαν</span>, <span class="ital">care</span>) <span class="ital">The care of the flesh</span> is neither forbidden in this passage as bad, nor praised as good, but it is reduced to order and fortified against the dangers to which it is liable, as something of a middle character [between bad and good], and yet in some respects the object of suspicion. <span class="greekheb">Πρόνοια</span>, <span class="ital">previous</span> [anticipatory] <span class="ital">care</span> of the flesh is opposed to holy <span class="ital">hope</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίας</span>, <span class="ital">lusts</span>) of pleasure and passion: with this comp. <a href="/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a> [and ch. <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a>.]<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/romans/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Provision (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Etymologically akin to take thought for, in 13:17.<p>Flesh<p>In the moral sense: the depraved nature. </body></html>
