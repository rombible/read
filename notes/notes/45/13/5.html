Of this respect conscience is the natural guardian.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/romans/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 The grace of the gospel teaches us submission and quiet, where pride and the carnal mind only see causes for murmuring and discontent. Whatever the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet the just power they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the general course of human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, and good subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin and corruption, that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear of punishment. Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do what thou canst to preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directs private persons to behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them, 1Ti 2:1,2. Christians must not use any trick or fraud. All smuggling, dealing in contraband goods, withholding or evading duties, is rebellion against the express command of God. Thus honest neighbours are robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the crimes of smugglers, and others who join with them, are abetted. It is painful that some professors of the gospel should countenance such dishonest practices. The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to learn and practise, that the godly in the land will always be found the quiet and the peaceable in the land, whatever others are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/romans/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;  dio. The "reasons" why we should be subject, which the apostle had given, were two,<p>(1) That government was appointed by God.<p>(2) that violation of the laws would necessarily expose to punishment.<p>Ye must needs be - It is "necessary" &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;  anagke&#772; to be. This is a word stronger than what implies mere "fitness" or propriety. It means that it is a matter of high obligation and of "necessity" to be subject to the civil ruler.<p>Not only for wrath - Not only on account of the "fear of punishment;" or the fact that wrath will be executed on evil doers.<p>For conscience' sake - As a matter of conscience, or of "duty to God," because "he" has appointed it, and made it necessary and proper. A good citizen yields obedience because it is the will of God; and a Christian makes it a part of his religion to maintain and obey the just laws of the land; see <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>, "I counsel them to keep the king's commandments, and "that in regard of the oath of God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/romans/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath&#8212;for fear of the magistrate's vengeance.<p>but also for conscience' sake&#8212;from reverence for God's authority. It is of Magistracy in general, considered as a divine ordinance, that this is spoken: and the statement applies equally to all forms of government, from an unchecked despotism&#8212;such as flourished when this was written, under the Emperor Nero&#8212;to a pure democracy. The inalienable right of all subjects to endeavor to alter or improve the form of government under which they live is left untouched here. But since Christians were constantly charged with turning the world upside down, and since there certainly were elements enough in Christianity of moral and social revolution to give plausibility to the charge, and tempt noble spirits, crushed under misgovernment, to take redress into their own hands, it was of special importance that the pacific, submissive, loyal spirit of those Christians who resided at the great seat of political power, should furnish a visible refutation of this charge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/romans/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> q.d. Seeing things are so as I have said; that magistracy is of God, that it is his ordinance, that it is for the benefit of mankind, and that it is armed with the sword; therefore there is a necessity of subjection, and that for a double reason: first, from fear of wrath, or punishment from the magistrate. Secondly, and more especially, from the obligation of conscience, because God hath so commanded; and to err in this particular, is to offend God, and to wound our own consciences: see <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/24-5.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.">1 Samuel 24:5</a> <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm" title="I counsel you to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a> <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1 Peter 2:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/romans/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore ye must needs be subject,....

The <span class="ital">necessity</span> of obedience is of such a character, that it is not merely <span class="ital">externally</span> suggested (by reason of the punishment to be avoided), but is based also on <span class="ital">moral</span> grounds; and these two considerations are exhibited by <span class="greekheb">διό</span> as the result of all that has been hitherto said (<a href="/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.

It is clear, accordingly, that <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκη</span> is not specially the <span class="ital">moral</span> necessity, but is to be taken generally, as it is only with the second <span class="greekheb">διά</span> that the <span class="ital">moral</span> side of the notion is brought forward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν ὀργήν</span>] <span class="ital">on account of the</span> magistrate’s <span class="ital">wrath</span>, <a href="/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.

Hence <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1 Peter 2:13</a> : <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν κύριον</span>. Aptly Melanchthon: “Nulla potentia humana, nulli exercitus magis muniunt imperia, quam haec severissima lex Dei: necesse est obedire propter conscientiam.” Both definitions given with <span class="greekheb">διά</span> belong, however, to <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκη</span> (<span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>), which bears the emphasis, like <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/romans/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a> f. <span class="greekheb">διὸ ἀνάγκη ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span>: there is a twofold necessity for submission—an external one, in the wrath of God which comes on resistance; an internal one, in conscience. Even apart from the consequences of disobedience conscience recognises the Divine right and function of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> and freely submits to it. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ φόρους τελεῖτε</span>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> seems to refer to the moral necessity to which appeal has been already made in <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν συνείδησιν</span>. It is because conscience recognises the moral value of the State as an ordinance of God that we pay taxes. <span class="greekheb">φόρος</span> is often used of the tribute paid by a subject nation: <a href="/nehemiah/5-4.htm" title="There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that on our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:4</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/8-4.htm" title="And that by their policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very far from them; and the kings also that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:">1Ma 8:4</a>, <a href="/luke/20-22.htm" title="Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?">Luke 20:22</a>; but here is probably used indefinitely of any imposts made for the support of the Government. <span class="greekheb">λειτουργοὶ γὰρ θεοῦ εἰσίν</span>: the use of <span class="greekheb">λειτουργοί</span> here instead of <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι</span> emphasises <span class="ital">the official character</span> of the service which they render. In the LXX <span class="greekheb">λειτουργεῖν</span> is the regular rendering of <span class="greekheb">שֵׁרֵת</span>, and therefore refers frequently to the service of the priests and Levites, a usage the influence of which is seen in chap. <a href="/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>; but this was by no means exclusively the case in the O.T.

For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Php 2:25</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a>). It is not a priestly character that the word assigns to the magistracy, but only an official character; they are in their place by God’s appointment for the public good. <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> means “to this very end”—the end described in <a href="/context/romans/13-3.htm" title="For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.

As regards the special question of <span class="ital">despotism</span>, it is treated here not by explicit condemnation, but by the statement of principles which will peacefully undermine its own <span class="ital">distinctive</span> principles. It is dealt with precisely as elsewhere the ownership of slaves is dealt with.

I do not mention this for the sake of contention, but because I am well assured of the advantage conferred on the Greek New Testament by him, who lessens the authority of the bilingual copies in any passage.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν ὀργὴν</span>, <span class="ital">for</span> [on account of, through fear of] <span class="ital">wrath</span>) which hangs over the evil-doer, <a href="/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.
