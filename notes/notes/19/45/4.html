This psalm is touching the King Jesus, his kingdom and government. It is a shame that this good matter is not more the subject of our discourse. There is more in Christ to engage our love, than there is or can be in any creature. This world and its charms are ready to draw away our hearts from Christ; therefore we are concerned to understand how much more worthy he is of our love. By his word, his promise, his gospel, the good will of God is made known to us, and the good work of God is begun and carried on in us. The psalmist, ver. 3-5, joyfully foretells the progress and success of the Messiah. The arrows of conviction are very terrible in the hearts of sinners, till they are humbled and reconciled; but the arrows of vengeance will be more so to his enemies who refuse to submit. All who have seen his glory and tasted his grace, rejoice to see him, by his word and Spirit, bring enemies and strangers under his dominion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in thy majesty ride prosperously - Margin, "Prosper thou, ride thou." The majesty here referred to is the glory or magnificence which became a prince of such rank, and going forth to such deeds. The prayer is, that he would go forth with the pomp and glory becoming one in that station. The word used here, rendered in the margin, "prosper thou," means properly to go over or through, to pass over, and may be correctly rendered here, pass on; that is, move forward to conquest. The word "ride" refers to the way in which warriors usually went forth to conquest in a chariot of war. The idea is that of one caparisoned for war, and with the glory appropriate to his rank as king, going forth to victory. This language is such as is often employed in the Scriptures to describe the Messiah as a conquering king.<p>Because of truth - On account of truth; or in the cause of truth. That is, the great purpose of his conquests would be to establish a kingdom based on truth, in contradistinction from the existing kingdom of darkness as based on error and falsehood. The "object" of his conquests was to secure the reign of truth over the minds of people. Compare <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>.<p>And meekness and righteousness - literally, "humility-righteousness;" or, humble right. It would be a kingdom or a conquest of righteousness," not" established, as most kingdoms are, by pride and arrogance and mere power, but a dominion where humility, meekness, gentleness would be at the foundation - that on which the whole superstructure would be reared. Its characteristic would be righteousness or justice - a righteousness and justice, however, not asserted and established by mere power, or by the pride of conquest, but which would be established and maintained by meekness or gentleness: a kingdom not of outward pomp and power, but the reign of the gentle virtues in the heart.<p>And thy right hand - The instrument of martial power and success; that which, in war, wields the sword and the spear. "Shall teach thee." Shall guide thee, or lead thee to the performance of terrible things.<p>Terrible things - Fearful deeds; things that are suited to excite astonishment or wonder. They were such things as would be regarded as distinguished achievements in war, indicating extraordinary valor; such conquests as would strike the world with amazement. We have here, therefore, a description of the Messiah as going forth to the great conquest of the world; and at the same time we have this intimation of the nature of his kingdom, that however great the "power" which would be exerted in securing its conquests, it would be founded on "truth:" it would be a kingdom where righteousness would prevail, and whose essential characteristic would be gentleness and peace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. ride prosperously&#8212;or conduct a successful war.<p>because of&#8212;for the interests of truth, &c.<p>meekness &#8230; righteousness&#8212;without any connection&#8212;that is, a righteousness or equity of government, distinguished by meekness or condescension (Ps 18:35).<p>right hand&#8212;or power, as its organ.<p>shall teach thee&#8212;point the way to terrible things; that is, in conquest of enemies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In thy majesty; </span> being thus gloriously or magnificently girt and armed. <span class="ital">Ride prosperously</span>; march on speedily (which is signified by riding) and successfully against thine enemies, i.e. thou shalt do so, as it is in the last clause, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall teach thee.</span> So imperatives are oft put for futures, and predictions are expressed in the form of commands or exhortations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; </span> or, <span class="ital">because of thy truth</span>, &c., i.e. because thou art worthy of this dominion and success; for thou neither didst obtain nor wilt manage thy kingdom by deceit or violence and unrighteousness, as the princes of the earth frequently do, but with truth and faithfulness, with meekness and gentleness towards thy people, and to all that shall submit to thee; with impartial justice and equity, whereby thy throne will be established, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm" title="It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.">Proverbs 16:12</a> 20:28</span>.
