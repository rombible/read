We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. He must be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away, that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement, thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ, of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanship of the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking of the Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor any comes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corrupt nature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thing is glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wrought out for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her. None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. This notes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her. Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart, are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoy the same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, every one, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Instead of the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, a Gentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name may endure for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations - The psalmist here evidently speaks as an inspired man, and the idea is that his thus singing the praises of the "king" - the Messiah - would be among the means of causing His name to be celebrated in all future ages. This song would go down to future times, and would serve to keep up the true knowledge of the Messiah in the far distant ages of the world. No one can doubt that this has been thus far accomplished; no one has any reason to doubt that this psalm "will be" among the means of keeping up the true knowledge of the Messiah, and of securing the remembrance of him upon the earth in all future periods of the world's history. This psalm has been on million of lips, in praise of the Messiah; it will be on hundreds of million more in future times, as expressive of tender love for the Redeemer.<p>Therefore shall the people praise thee forever and ever - Thy praise will never cease to be celebrated. The time will never come on earth when that praise will die away; and in all the eternity beyond the termination of this world's history there never will arrive a period when thy name will not be honored, and when thy praises shall cease to be sung.

The glories of this empire shall be as wide as the world and lasting as eternity.<p>therefore&#8212;Because thus glorious, the praise shall be universal and perpetual. Some writers have taxed their ingenuity to find in the history and fortunes of Christ and His Church exact parallels for every part of this splendid allegory, not excepting its gorgeous Oriental imagery. Thus, by the dresses of the king and queen, are thought to be meant the eminent endowments and graces of Christ and His people. The attendant women, supposed (though inconsistently it might seem with the inspired character of the work) to be concubines, are thought to represent the Gentile churches, and the bride the Jewish, &c. But it is evident that we cannot pursue such a mode of interpretation. For, following the allegory, we must suspend to the distant future the results of a union whose consummation as a marriage is still distant (compare Re 21:9). In fact, the imagery here and elsewhere sets before us the Church in two aspects. As a body, it is yet incomplete, the whole is yet ungathered. As a moral institution, it is yet imperfect. In the final catastrophe it will be complete and perfect. Thus, as a bride adorned, &c., it will be united with its Lord. Thus the union of Christ and the Church triumphant is set forth. On the other hand, in regard to its component parts, the relation of Christ as head, as husband, &c., already exists, and as these parts form an institution in this world, it is by His union with it, and the gifts and graces with which He endows it, that a spiritual seed arises and spreads in the world. Hence we must fix our minds only on the one simple but grand truth, that Christ loves the Church, is head over all things for it, raises it in His exaltation to the highest moral dignity&#8212;a dignity of which every, even the meanest, sincere disciple will partake. As to the time, then, in which this allegorical prophecy is to fulfilled, it may be said that no periods of time are specially designated. The characteristics of the relation of Christ and His Church are indicated, and we may suppose that the whole process of His exaltation from the declaration of His Sonship, by His resurrection, to the grand catastrophe of the final judgment, with all the collateral blessings to the Church and the world, lay before the vision of the inspired prophet.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As he began the Psalm with the celebration of the king’s praises, so now he endeth with it, and adds this important circumstance, that this nuptial song should not only serve for the present solemnity, as others of that kind do, but that it should be remembered and sung in all successive generations; which plainly showeth that it was not composed upon such a slight and transitory occasion as that of Solomon’s marriage with Pharaoh’s daughter, which was soon forgotten, and the Israelites had little cause to remember it with any satisfaction; but upon that great and glorious and everlasting marriage between Christ and his church, of which this is most properly and literally verified. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations,....

With &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497; he implores for himself a hearing; by &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; yb ;gni he directs her eye towards the new relationship into which she is just entering; by &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1498; he bespeaks her attention to the exhortation that follows; by &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; he puts himself in a position in relation to her similar to that which the teacher and preacher occupies who addresses the bridal pair at the altar. She is to forget her people and her father's house, to sever her natural, inherited, and customary relationships of life, both as regards outward form and inward affections; and should the king desire her beauty, to which he has a right, - for he, as being her husband (<a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>), and more especially as being king, is her lord, - she is to show towards him her profoundest, reverent devotion. &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; is a hypothetical protasis according to Ges. 128, 2, c. The reward of this willing submission is the universal homage of the nations. It cannot be denied on the ground of syntax that &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1512; admits of being rendered "and O daughter of Tyre" (Hitzig), - a rendering which would also give additional support to our historical interpretation of the Psalm, - although, apart from the one insecure passage, <a href="/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a> (Ew. 340, c), there is no instance to be found in which a vocative with &#1493; occurs (<a href="/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-21.htm">Isaiah 44:21</a>), when another vocative has not already preceded it. But to what purpose would be, in this particular instance, this apostrophe with the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1512;, from which it looks as though she were indebted to her ancestral house, and not to the king whose own she is become, for the acts of homage which are prospectively set before her? Such, however, is not the case; "daughter of Tyre" is a subject-notion, which can all the more readily be followed by the predicate in the plural, since it stands first almost like a nomin. absol. The daughter, i.e., the population of Tyre - approaching with presents shall they court (lit., stroke) thy face, i.e., meeting thee bringing love, they shall seek to propitiate thy love towards themselves. (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; corresponds to the Latin mulcere in the sense of delenire; for &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, Arab. h&#803;la&#770; (root &#1495;&#1500;, whence &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, Arab. h&#803;ll, solvit, laxavit), means properly to be soft and tender, of taste to be sweet (in another direction: to be lax, weak, sick); the Piel consequently means to soften, conciliate, to make gentle that which is austere. Tyre, however, is named only by way of example; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; is not an apposition, but a continuation of the subject: not only Tyre, but in general those who are the richest among each separate people or nation. Just as &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (<a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>) are the poorest of mankind, so &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; are the richest among the peoples of the earth.<p>As regards the meaning which the congregation or church has to assign to the whole passage, the correct paraphrase of the words "and forget thy people" is to be found even in the Targum: "Forget the evil deeds of the ungodly among thy people, and the house of the idols which thou hast served in the house of thy father." It is not indeed the hardened mass of Israel which enters into such a loving relationship to God and to His Christ, but, as prophecy from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a> onward declares, a remnant thoroughly purged by desolating and sifting judgments and rescued, which, in order to belong wholly to Christ, and to become the holy seed of a better future (<a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>), must cut asunder all bonds of connection with the stiff-neckedly unbelieving people and paternal house, and in like manner to Abram secede from them. This church of the future is fair; for she is expiated (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>), washed (<a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>), and adorned (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>) by her God. And if she does homage to Him, without looking back, He not only remains her own, but in Him everything that is glorious belonging to the world also becomes her own. Highly honoured by the King of kings, she is the queen among the daughters of kings, to whom Tyre and the richest among peoples of every order are zealous to express their loving and joyful recognition. Very similar language to that used here of the favoured church of the Messiah is used in <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>. of the Messiah Himself. </body></html>
