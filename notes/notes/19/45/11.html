We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. He must be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away, that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement, thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ, of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanship of the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking of the Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor any comes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corrupt nature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thing is glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wrought out for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her. None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. This notes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her. Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart, are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoy the same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, every one, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Instead of the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, a Gentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name may endure for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty - That is, in consequence of your love to him, and your entire devotion of yourself to him. The word "desire" here is equivalent to having pleasure in; as meaning that his affliction would thus be fixed on her. In this way - by forgetting her own home, and devoting herself to him - she would secure his affection. In the married life, mere "beauty" will not secure permanently the love of a husband. The heart, as given to him, and as faithful to him, will alone secure his love. In like manner, it is nothing but sincere affection - true love on the part of the professed friends of the Saviour - the forgetting and forsaking of all else - that will secure his love, or make the church to him an object of desire.<p>For he is thy Lord - That is, as a husband he sustains this relation to thee; or, this appellation may be given to him. In what sense this is true in respect to a husband, see the notes at <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>; notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.

The relation of subjection to her spouse at once accords with the law of marriage, as given in Ge 3:16; 18:12; Eph 5:22; 1Pe 3:5, 6, and the relation of the Church to Christ (Eph 5:24).

He is a hero. The praise of his heroic strength takes the form of a summons to exert it and aid the good in obtaining the victory over evil. Brightness and majesty, as the objects to &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, alternating with the sword, are not in apposition to this which is their instrument and symbol (Hengstenberg), but permutatives, inasmuch as &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; is zeugmatically referable to both objects: the king is (1) to gird himself with his sword, and (2) to surround himself with his kingly, God-like doxa. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512; is the brilliancy of the divine glory (<a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>), of which the glory of the Davidic kingship is a reflection (<a href="/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>); mentioned side by side with the sword, it is, as it were, the panoply that surrounds the king as bright armour. In <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, written accidentally a second time, is probably to be struck out, as Olshausen and Hupfeld are of opinion. Hitzig points it &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, "and step forth;" but this is not Hebrew. As the text runs, wa-hada&#772;rcha (with Legarme preceded by Illuj, vid., Accentsystem xiii. 8c, 9) looks as though it were repeated out of <a href="/psalms/45-4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a> in the echo-like and interlinked style that we frequently find in the songs of degrees, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>; and in fact repeated as an accusative of more exact definition (in the same bold manner as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13-14</a>) to &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, which, like Arab. s&#803;lh&#803;, starting from the primary notion of cleaving, breaking through, pressing forward, comes to have the notion of carrying anything through prosperously, of being successful, pervadere et bene procedere (cf. the corresponding development of signification in Arab. flh&#803;, 'flh&#803;), and, according to Ges. 142, rem. 1, gives to &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; the adverbial notion of that which is effectual (victorious) or effective and successful. We cannot determine whether &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; is here intended to say vehi curru or vehi equo; but certainly not upon a mule or an ass (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), which are the beasts ridden in a time of peace. The king going forth to battle either rides in a war-chariot (like Ahab and Jehoshaphat, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>), or upon a war-horse, as in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a> the Logos of God is borne upon a white horse. That which he is to accomplish as he rides forth in majesty is introduced by &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (for the sake of, on account of), which is used just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>. The combination &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;-is very similar to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a> (nakedness - ignominy  equals  ignominious nakedness), if &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; is to be taken as the name of a virtue. The two words are then the names of virtues, like &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (truth  equals  veracity, which loves and practises that which is true and which is hostile to lying, falseness, and dissimulation); and whereas &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; would signify meek righteousness, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, righteousness meekness, this conjunction standing in the middle between an addition and an asyndeton denotes meekness and righteousness as twin-sisters and reciprocally pervasive. The virtues named, however, stand for those who exemplify them and who are in need of help, on whose behalf the king is called upon to enter the strife: the righteous, if they are at the same time &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), are doubly worthy and in need of his help. Nevertheless another explanation of &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; presents itself, and one that is all the more probable as occurring just in this Psalm which has such a North-Palestinian colouring. The observation, that North-Palestinian writers do not always point the construct state with ath, in favour of which Hitzig, on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, wrongly appeals to <a href="/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a>, but rightly to <a href="/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>; <a href="/judges/8-32.htm">Judges 8:32</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>), is perfectly correct. Accordingly &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; may possibly be equivalent to &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, but not in the signification business, affair  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, parallel with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, but in the signification afflictio (after the form &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a>); so that it may be rendered: in order to put a stop to the oppression of righteousness or the suffering of innocence. The jussive &#1493;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, like &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, begins the apodosis of a hypothetical protasis that is virtually there (Ew. 347, b): so shall thy right hand teach thee, i.e., lead thee forth and cause thee to see terrible things, i.e., awe-inspiring deeds.<p>But in <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a> both summons and desire pass over into the expression of a sure and hopeful prospect and a vision, in which that which is to be is present to the mind: thine arrows are sharpened, and therefore deadly to those whom they hit; peoples shall fall (&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;)<p>(Note: It is not &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;; for the pause falls upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, and the Athnach of &#1497;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493; stands merely in the place of Zekaph (<a href="/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>). The Athnach after Olewejored does not produce any pausal effect; vid., <a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm">Psalm 129:1</a>, and cf. supra, p. 56, note 2.)<p>under thee, i.e., so that thou passest over them as they lie upon the ground; in the heart of the enemies of the king, viz., they (i.e., the arrows) will stick. The harsh ellipse is explained by the fact of the poet having the scene of battle before his mind as though he were an eye-witness of it. The words "in the heart of the king's enemies" are an exclamation accompanied by a pointing with the finger. Thither, he means to say, those sharp arrows fly and smite. Crusius' explanation is similar, but it goes further than is required: apostrophe per prosopopaeiam directa ad sagittas quasi jubens, quo tendere debeant. We are here reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>, where a similar &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; occurs in a prophetico-messianic connection. Moreover, even according to its reference to contemporary history the whole of this strophe sounds Messianic. The poet desires that the king whom he celebrates may rule and triumph after the manner of the Messiah; that he may succour truth and that which is truly good, and overcome the enmity of the world, or, as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> expresses it, that the God-anointed King of Zion may shatter everything that rises up in opposition with an iron sceptre. This anointed One, however, is not only the Son of David, but also of God. He is called absolutely &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;. Isaiah calls Him, even in the cradle, &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>. We shall not, therefore, find it to be altogether intolerable, if the poet now addresses him as &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, although the picture thus far sketched is thoroughly human in all its ideality. </body></html>
