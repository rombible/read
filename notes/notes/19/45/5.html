This psalm is touching the King Jesus, his kingdom and government. It is a shame that this good matter is not more the subject of our discourse. There is more in Christ to engage our love, than there is or can be in any creature. This world and its charms are ready to draw away our hearts from Christ; therefore we are concerned to understand how much more worthy he is of our love. By his word, his promise, his gospel, the good will of God is made known to us, and the good work of God is begun and carried on in us. The psalmist, ver. 3-5, joyfully foretells the progress and success of the Messiah. The arrows of conviction are very terrible in the hearts of sinners, till they are humbled and reconciled; but the arrows of vengeance will be more so to his enemies who refuse to submit. All who have seen his glory and tasted his grace, rejoice to see him, by his word and Spirit, bring enemies and strangers under his dominion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thine arrows are sharp in the heart ... - literally, "Thine arrows are sharp - the people under thee shall fall - in the heart of the enemies of the king." The process of "thought" in the verse seems to be this: First. The "arrows" are seen as sharp or penetrating. Second. The "people" are seen falling as those arrows are shot forth. Third. It is seen that those who fall are the "enemies of the king," and that the arrows have pierced the "heart." The word "sharp" is applied to the arrows as denoting that they were adapted to "pierce." Sometimes arrows are blunted, or with a thick head, rather adapted to smite with force than to wound by penetrating. The bow and the arrow were common instruments in ancient wars, and were mainly used by those who went forth to battle in a chariot. Compare <a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-21.htm">2 Kings 9:21-24</a>. As pertaining to the Messiah, the reference here is, of course, to the "truth," and to the power of that truth in penetrating the hearts of people. Compare the notes at <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>.<p>In the heart of the king's enemies - That is, the "truths" stated by the Messiah, the conquering king, would penetrate deep into the soul, and slay the sinner, the enemy of the king, that is, of the Messiah. The idea is, that truth would produce an effect in regard to the hopes of the sinner - his self-confidence - his life "as" a sinner - like that which the arrow does when it penetrates the heart. Compare <a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a> : "For I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died." See also the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10-11</a>.<p>Whereby the people fall under thee - As the effect of the arrows; as the effect of truth. The representation is that of victory. As here represented, it is the victory of truth; a conquest by subjecting people to the authority and reign of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Meaning either the Jews, who were the implacable enemies of Christ, and who would not have him to reign over them; in the midst of whom were sent his arrows, of the sword, famine, and pestilence, and which were very sharp, and made sad havoc among them, and caused such a time of tribulation as was not before, or has been since, <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>; or else the doctrines of the Gospel. The Scriptures are the quiver out of which they are taken; the Gospel is the bow into which they are put, and out of which they are shot; and ministers are the archers that draw the bow at a venture, and shoot them; and which are compared to "arrows" for their swift, sudden, and secret motion, and for their piercing and penetrating power and efficacy: and these are Christ's, which he is the author of, and which he makes use of to good purpose, by striking the hearts of his people with them, who in their state of unregeneracy are enemies to him; which appears by their wicked works, and as they were when he died for them, and reconciled them to God; by means of which arrows fixed in them, and with which their hearts are pricked and wounded, they submit unto him, signified by the next clause: <p>whereby the people fall under thee: acknowledge themselves sinners; fall down at his feet; humbly implore his grace and mercy; submit to his righteousness; depend on him alone for salvation; adore him, and give him the glory of it, as well as become subject to his laws and ordinances. This is to be understood of those who are God's covenant people, whom he has given to Christ, and he has redeemed by his blood; and particularly the Gentiles, who were not a people, but now openly are, in distinction from the Jews, the enemies of the King Messiah. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/45.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.
