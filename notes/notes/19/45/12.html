We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. He must be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away, that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement, thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ, of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanship of the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking of the Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor any comes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corrupt nature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thing is glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wrought out for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her. None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. This notes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her. Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart, are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoy the same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, every one, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Instead of the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, a Gentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name may endure for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift - On the situation of Tyre, and its ancient splendor, see the notes at <a href="/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; the introduction to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>; and the notes at that chapter. In the time of the psalmist it was probably the most wealthy and luxurious commercial town then existing; and it is referred to here as meaning that persons of highest rank, and of the greatest riches, and those who were surrounded most by affluence and luxury, would come to honor the king. Even the daughter of the magnificent prince of Tyre would deem it an honor to be present with a gift becoming her exalted station, and properly representing the wealth of a king of so much magnificence. This is the imagery. As applied to the Messiah, it is a description of the honor which would be shown to "him" by those of highest rank and largest wealth. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-7</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>, note; <a href="/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a> note.<p>Even the rich among the people - Rich men scattered among the people.

The word rendered "entreat" - &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;  cha&#770;la&#770;h - means properly to be rubbed; then, to be polished; and then, in the form used here (Piel) to rub, or stroke the face of anyone; to soothe or caress; to flatter, to court; and the idea is literally that of one who caresses or soothes, or seeks to conciliate. The sense here is, "the richest of the nations shall make court to thee with gifts." Gesenius, Lexicon. Ultimately, this will be true in regard to the Messiah. Compare as above, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>. The wealth of the world will yet be laid at his feet, and, placed at his disposal. The effect of true conversion is always to make people willing to consecrate to the Saviour all that they possess. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. daughter of Tyre&#8212;(Ps 9:14); denotes the people. Tyre, celebrated for its great wealth, is selected to represent the richest nations, an idea confirmed by the next clause. These gifts are brought as means to conciliate the royal parties, representing the admitted subjection of the offerers. This well sets forth the exalted position of the Church and her head, whose moral qualities receive the homage of the world. The contribution of material wealth to sustain the institutions of the Church may be included (compare "riches of the Gentiles," Ps 72:10; Isa 60:5-10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The daughter of Tyre, </span> i.e. the people or citizens of Tyre; as <span class="ital">the daughter of Zion</span>, or Jerusalem, or Babel, &c., are put for their inhabitants, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/19-21.htm" title="This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.">2 Kings 19:21</a> <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8</a> <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a></span>.

Ges. 110, 2, b. Accordingly one might adopt the first mode of interpretation, which is also commended by the fact that the earthly throne of the theocratic king is actually called &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>. But the sentence "thy throne of God is an everlasting one" sounds tautological, inasmuch as that which the predicate asserts is already implied in the subject; and we have still first of all to try whether &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; cannot, with the lxx &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, be taken as a vocative. Now, since before everything else God's throne is eternal (<a href="/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19</a>), and a love of righteousness and a hatred of evil is also found elsewhere as a description of divine holiness (<a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>), &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; would be obliged to be regarded as addressed to God, if language addressed to the king did not follow with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. But might &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; by any possibility be even addressed to the king who is here celebrated? It is certainly true that the custom with the Elohim-Psalms of using Elohim as of equal dignity with Jahve is not favourable to this supposition; but the following surpassing of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; renders it possible.

He calls him &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, just as Isaiah calls the exalted royal child whom he exultingly salutes in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-1.htm">Psalm 9:1-6</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;. He gives him this name, because in the transparent exterior of his fair humanity he sees the glory and holiness of God as having attained a salutary of merciful conspicuousness among men. At the same time, however, he guards this calling of the king by the name Elohim against being misapprehended by immediately distinguishing the God, who stands above him, from the divine king by the words "Elohim, thy God," which, in the Korahitic Psalms, and in the Elohimic Psalms in general, is equivalent to Jahve, thy God" (<a href="/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-15.htm">Psalm 48:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>); and the two words are accordingly united by Munach.<p>(Note: The view that the Munach is here vicarius Tiphchae anterioris (Dachselt in his Biblia Accentuata) is erroneous, vid., Accentuationssystem, xviii. 4. It is the conjunctive to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498;, which, in Heidenheim and Baer, on the authority of the Codices, has Tiphcha anterior, not Athnach as in the editions heretofore published. The proper place for the Athnach would at first be by &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; but according to Accentuationssystem, xix. 6, it cannot stand there.)<p>Because the king's sceptre is a "sceptre of uprightness" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>), because he loves righteousness and consequently (fut. consec.) hates iniquity, therefore God, his God, has anointed him with the oil of joy (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>; cf. on the construction <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) above his fellows. What is intended is not the anointing to his office (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a> with <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>) as a dedication to a happy and prosperous reign, but that God has poured forth upon him, more especially on this his nuptial day, a superabundant joy, both outwardly and in his spirit, such as He has bestowed upon no other king upon the face of the earth. That he rises high above all those round about him is self-evident; but even among his fellows of royal station, kings like himself, he has no equal. It is a matter of question whether the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>) has taken the first &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; of the expression &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; as a vocative. Apollinaris does not seem so to have understood him; for he renders it &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;, and the Greek expositors also take &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; here as a nominative. </body></html>
