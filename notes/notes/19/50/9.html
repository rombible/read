We are here warned not to rest in these performances. And let us beware of resting in any form. God demands the heart, and how can human inventions please him, when repentance, faith, and holiness are neglected? In the day of distress we must apply to the Lord by fervent prayer. Our troubles, though we see them coming from God's hand, must drive us to him, not drive us from him. We must acknowledge him in all our ways, depend upon his wisdom, power, and goodness, and refer ourselves wholly to him, and so give him glory. Thus must we keep up communion with God; meeting him with prayers under trials, and with praises in deliverances. A believing supplicant shall not only be graciously answered as to his petition, and so have cause for praising God, but shall also have grace to praise him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will take no bullock out of thy house - Bullocks were offered regularly in the Hebrew service and sacrifice <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-11.htm">Exodus 29:11</a>, <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-23.htm">1 Kings 18:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33</a>; and it is with reference to this that the language is used here. In obedience to the law it was right and proper to offer such sacrifices; and the design here is not to express disapprobation of these offerings in themselves considered. On this subject - on the external compliance with the law in this respect - God says <a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8</a> that he had no cause to complain against them. It was only with respect to the design and the spirit with which they did this, that the language in this verse and the following verses is used. The idea which it is the purpose of these verses to suggest is, that God did not "need" such offerings; that they were not to be made "as if" he needed them; and that if he needed such he was not "dependent" on them, for all the beasts of the earth and all the fowls of the mountains were his, and could be taken for that purpose; and that if he took what was claimed to be theirs - the bullocks and the goats - he did not wrong them, for all were his, and he claimed only his own.<p>Nor he-goats out of thy folds - Goats were also offered in sacrifice. <a href="/leviticus/3-12.htm">Leviticus 3:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a> : <a href="/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-15. However scrupulous in external worship, it was offered as if they conferred an obligation in giving God His own, and with a degrading view of Him as needing it [Ps 50:9-13]. Reproving them for such foolish and blasphemous notions, He teaches them to offer, or literally, "sacrifice," thanksgiving, and pay, or perform, their vows&#8212;that is, to bring, with the external symbolical service, the homage of the heart, and faith, penitence, and love.

The names of God are heaped up in <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> in order to gain a thoroughly full-toned exordium for the description of God as the Judge of the world. Hupfeld considers this heaping up cold and stiff; but it is exactly in accordance with the taste of the Elohimic style. The three names are co-ordinate with one another; for &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean "God of gods," which would rather be expressed by &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1488;&#1500; is the name for God as the Almighty; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; as the Revered One; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; as the Being, absolute in His existence, and who accordingly freely influences and moulds history after His own plan - this His peculiar proper-name is the third in the triad. Perfects alternate in <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> with futures, at one time the idea of that which is actually taking place, and at another of that which is future, predominating. Jahve summons the earth to be a witness of the divine judgment upon the people of the covenant. The addition "from the rising of the sun to its going down," shows that the poet means the earth in respect of its inhabitants. He speaks, and because what He speaks is of universal significance He makes the earth in all its compass His audience. This summons precedes His self-manifestation. It is to be construed, with Aquila, the Syriac, Jerome, Tremellius, and Montanus, "out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, Elohim shineth." Zion, the perfect in beauty (cf. the dependent passage <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>, and 1 Macc. 2:12, where the temple is called &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), because the place of the presence of God the glorious One, is the bright spot whence the brightness of the divine manifestation spreads forth like the rising sun. In itself certainly it is not inappropriate, with the lxx, Vulgate, and Luther, to take &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497; as a designation of the manifestation of Elohim in His glory, which is the non pius ultra of beauty, and consequently to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>, and not according to <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a> (more particularly since Jeremiah so readily gives a new turn to the language of older writers). But, taking the fact into consideration that nowhere in Scripture is beauty (&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;) thus directly predicated of God, to whom peculiarly belongs a glory that transcends all beauty, we must follow the guidance of the accentuation, which marks &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497; by Mercha as in apposition with &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. Psychol. S. 49; tr. p. 60). The poet beholds the appearing of God, an appearing that resembles the rising of the sun (&#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;, as in the Asaph <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>, after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, with a transition of the primary notion of rising, Arab. yf&#8219;, wf&#8219;, to that of beaming forth and lighting up far and wide, as in Arab. st&#803;&#8219;); for "our God will come and by no means keep silence." It is not to be rendered: Let our God come (Hupfeld) and not keep silence (Olshausen). The former wish comes too late after the preceding &#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488; is consequently veniet, and written as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>), and the latter is superfluous. &#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>, and frequently, implies in the negative a lively interest on the part of the writer: He cannot, He dare not keep silence, His glory will not allow it. He who gave the Law, will enter into judgment with those who have it and do not keep it; He cannot long look on and keep silence. He must punish, and first of all by word in order to warn them against the punishment by deeds. Fire and storm are the harbingers of the Lawgiver of Sinai who now appears as Judge. The fire threatens to consume the sinners, and the storm (viz., a tempest accompanied with lightning and thunder, as in <a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>) threatens to drive them away like chaff. The expression in <a href="/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a> is like <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>. The fem. Niph. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; does not refer to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, but is used as neuter: it is stormed, i.e., a storm rages (Apollinaris, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;). The fire is His wrath; and the storm the power or force of His wrath. </body></html>
