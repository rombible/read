We are here warned not to rest in these performances. And let us beware of resting in any form. God demands the heart, and how can human inventions please him, when repentance, faith, and holiness are neglected? In the day of distress we must apply to the Lord by fervent prayer. Our troubles, though we see them coming from God's hand, must drive us to him, not drive us from him. We must acknowledge him in all our ways, depend upon his wisdom, power, and goodness, and refer ourselves wholly to him, and so give him glory. Thus must we keep up communion with God; meeting him with prayers under trials, and with praises in deliverances. A believing supplicant shall not only be graciously answered as to his petition, and so have cause for praising God, but shall also have grace to praise him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, O my people, and I will speak - God himself is now introduced as speaking, and as stating the principles on which the judgment will proceed. The previous verses are introductory, or are designed to bring the scene of the judgment before the mind. The solemn scene now opens, and God himself speaks, especially as rebuking the disposition to rely on the mere forms of religion, while its spirituality and its power are denied. The purpose of the whole is, by asking how these things will appear in the judgment, to imply the vanity of "mere" forms of religion now. The particular address is made to the "people" of God, or to "Israel," because the purpose of the psalmist was to rebuke the prevailing tendency to rely on outward forms.<p>O Israel, and I will testify against thee - In the judgment. In view of those scenes, and as "at" that time, I will "now" bear this solemn testimony against the views which you entertain on the subject of religion, and the practices which prevail in your worship.<p>I am God, even thy God - I am the true God, and therefore I have a right to speak; I am "thy" God - the God who has been the Protector of thy people - acknowledged as the God of the nation - and therefore I claim the right to declare the great principles which pertain to true worship, and which constitute true religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

It is clearly, in the first place, meant for Israel; but is equally applicable to the visible church of God in every age. It declares the futility of external worship when spiritual faith is absent and the mere outward ceremonial is rested in.<p><a href="/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a><p>"Hear, O my people, and I will speak." Because Jehovah speaks, and they are avowedly his own people, they are bound to give earnest heed. "Let me speak," saith the great I am. The heavens and earth are but listeners, the Lord is about both to testify and to judge. "O Israel, and I will testify against thee." Their covenant name is mentioned to give point to the address; it was a double evil that the chosen nation should become so carnal, so unspiritual, so false, so heartless to their God. God himself, whose eyes sleep not, who is not misled by rumour, but sees for himself, enters on the scene as witness against his favoured nation. Alas! for us when God, even our fathers' God, testifies to the hypocrisy of the visible church. "I am God, even thy God." He had taken them to be his peculiar people above all other nations, and they had in the most solemn manner avowed that he was their God. Hence the special reason for calling them to account. The law began with, "I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt," and now the session of their judgment opens with the same reminder of their singular position, privilege, and responsibility. It is not only that Jehovah is God, but thy God, O Israel; this it is that makes thee so amenable to his searching reproofs.<p><a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8</a><p>"I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifice or thy burnt offerings, to have been ever before me." Though they had not failed in maintaining his outward worship, or even if they had, he was not about to call them to account for this: a more weighty matter was now under consideration. They thought the daily sacrifices and the abounding burnt offerings to be everything: he counted them nothing if the inner sacrifice of heart devotion had been neglected. What was greatest with them was least with God. It is even so today. Sacraments (so called) and sacred rites are the main concern with unconverted but religious men, but with the Most High the spiritual worship which they forget is the sole matter. Let the external be maintained by all means according to the divine command, but if the secret and spiritual be not in them, they are a vain oblation, a dead ritual, and even an abomination before the Lord.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having brought in God as coming to judgment with them, he now gives an account of the process and of the sentence of the Judge, whose words are contained in this and the following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will testify against thee; </span> I will plead with thee, and declare my charge or indictment against thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Even thy God; </span> not only in general, as thou art my creature, but in a special manner, by many singular favours and obligations, and by that solemn covenant made at Sinai; whereby I avouched thee to be my peculiar people, and thou didst avouch me to be thy God, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/26-17.htm" title="You have avouched the LORD this day to be your God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to listen to his voice:">Deu 26:17</a>,18</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/50.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear, O my people,....

The trial begins. God is the accuser as well as the judge. Israel’s sacrifices are unexceptionable, but it is not slain beasts which the Lord of all the earth desires, but the devotion of the heart, exhibited in thanksgiving and trust. The people as a whole are addressed. The duty which is enforced is their duty towards God, corresponding to the first Table of the Decalogue.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> - "The continuance of this dramatic scene," as Professor Cheyne remarks, "scarcely answers to the commencement. The judgment seems to be adjourned, or to be left to the conscience of the defendants." The faithful are summoned, and appear, but not to receive unqualified commendation (see <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-40</a>). Rather they receive a warning. The strong and prolonged depreciation of sacrifice (vers. 8-13) necessarily implies that in the religion of the time too much stress was laid upon it. We know that, in the heathen world, men sought to buy God's favour by their sacrifices, some] believing that, physically, the gods were nourished by the steam of the victims, others regarding them as laid under obligations which they could not disregard (Plato, 'Rep.,' it. &sect; 6; Rawlinson, 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 124, 125). We know, too, that, in the later monarchy, sacrifice to so great an extent superseded true spiritual worship among the Israelites themselves, that it became an offence to God, and was spoken of in terms of reprobation (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>).

The names of God are heaped up in <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> in order to gain a thoroughly full-toned exordium for the description of God as the Judge of the world. Hupfeld considers this heaping up cold and stiff; but it is exactly in accordance with the taste of the Elohimic style. The three names are co-ordinate with one another; for &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean "God of gods," which would rather be expressed by &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1488;&#1500; is the name for God as the Almighty; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; as the Revered One; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; as the Being, absolute in His existence, and who accordingly freely influences and moulds history after His own plan - this His peculiar proper-name is the third in the triad. Perfects alternate in <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> with futures, at one time the idea of that which is actually taking place, and at another of that which is future, predominating. Jahve summons the earth to be a witness of the divine judgment upon the people of the covenant. The addition "from the rising of the sun to its going down," shows that the poet means the earth in respect of its inhabitants. He speaks, and because what He speaks is of universal significance He makes the earth in all its compass His audience. This summons precedes His self-manifestation. It is to be construed, with Aquila, the Syriac, Jerome, Tremellius, and Montanus, "out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, Elohim shineth." Zion, the perfect in beauty (cf. the dependent passage <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>, and 1 Macc. 2:12, where the temple is called &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), because the place of the presence of God the glorious One, is the bright spot whence the brightness of the divine manifestation spreads forth like the rising sun. In itself certainly it is not inappropriate, with the lxx, Vulgate, and Luther, to take &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497; as a designation of the manifestation of Elohim in His glory, which is the non pius ultra of beauty, and consequently to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>, and not according to <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a> (more particularly since Jeremiah so readily gives a new turn to the language of older writers). But, taking the fact into consideration that nowhere in Scripture is beauty (&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;) thus directly predicated of God, to whom peculiarly belongs a glory that transcends all beauty, we must follow the guidance of the accentuation, which marks &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497; by Mercha as in apposition with &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. Psychol. S. 49; tr. p. 60). The poet beholds the appearing of God, an appearing that resembles the rising of the sun (&#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;, as in the Asaph <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>, after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, with a transition of the primary notion of rising, Arab. yf&#8219;, wf&#8219;, to that of beaming forth and lighting up far and wide, as in Arab. st&#803;&#8219;); for "our God will come and by no means keep silence." It is not to be rendered: Let our God come (Hupfeld) and not keep silence (Olshausen). The former wish comes too late after the preceding &#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488; is consequently veniet, and written as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>), and the latter is superfluous. &#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>, and frequently, implies in the negative a lively interest on the part of the writer: He cannot, He dare not keep silence, His glory will not allow it. He who gave the Law, will enter into judgment with those who have it and do not keep it; He cannot long look on and keep silence. He must punish, and first of all by word in order to warn them against the punishment by deeds. Fire and storm are the harbingers of the Lawgiver of Sinai who now appears as Judge. The fire threatens to consume the sinners, and the storm (viz., a tempest accompanied with lightning and thunder, as in <a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>) threatens to drive them away like chaff. The expression in <a href="/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a> is like <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>. The fem. Niph. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; does not refer to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, but is used as neuter: it is stormed, i.e., a storm rages (Apollinaris, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;). The fire is His wrath; and the storm the power or force of His wrath. </body></html>
