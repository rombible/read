This is no more out of keeping with the figure of the <span class= "ital">vine </span>than the table is with that of olive plants. Though the Hebrews had not yet developed the fatal habit of secluding their women, as later Orientals have done, still there was a strict custom which allotted a more private tent (<a href="/genesis/18-9.htm" title="And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.">Genesis 18:9</a>) or part of a house to them. And doubtless we are here also to think of the good housewife who is engaged within at the household duties, and is not like the idle gossip, sitting “at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city” (<a href="/proverbs/9-14.htm" title="For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,">Proverbs 9:14</a>). The <span class= "ital">vine </span>and <span class= "ital">olive </span>are in Hebrew poetry frequent symbols of fruitfulness and of a happy, flourishing state. (See <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm" title="But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>.) The comparison of children to the healthy young shoots of a tree is, of course, common to all poetry, being indeed latent in such expressions as “scion of a noble house.” (Comp. Euripides, <span class= "ital">Medea </span>1,098: “a sweet young shoot of children.”)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/128.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/128-3.htm" title="Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house: your children like olive plants round about your table.">Psalm 128:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine — </span>“He will bless thee also in thy wife, and make her as fruitful as the vine, which spreads itself, laden with full clusters, over all the sides of thy house; and in thy hopeful children too, who shall grow up and flourish like the young <span class="ital">olive-plants </span>that are set in thy arbour, round about thy table.” Thus Bishop Patrick interprets the verse, and certainly the text, in its most obvious and literal sense, seems to countenance his interpretation. Mr. Harmer, however, in his <span class="ital">Observations on Divers Passages of Scripture, </span>questions the propriety of it, remarking that it does not appear, from the accounts of any travellers, that it was ever the custom of the Jews to conduct vines along the sides of their houses, and that we find no such arbours in the Levant as the bishop supposes, composed of young olive-plants, in the midst of which tables were set. He therefore understands the words thus: “Thy wife shall be in the sides, or private apartments of thy house, fruitful as a thriving vine:” considering the sides of the house as referring to the wife, not to the vine; and the table, in the other clause, to the children only, not to the olives. Cocceius, however, and Rabbi Kimchi, agree with Bishop Patrick, as does Dr. Hammond also, whose words are, “Vines, it seems, were then planted on the sides of houses, as now they are among us, and not only in vineyards, and to that the psalmist here refers. So likewise of olive-plants it is observable, not only that tables were dressed up with the boughs of them, <span class="ital">ramis felicis olivæ, </span>but that, in the eastern countries, they were usually planted, as in arbours, to shade the table, entertainments being made without doors, in gardens, under that umbrage, which gave all the liberty of the cool winds and refreshing blasts. An image whereof we have <a href="/genesis/18-4.htm" title="Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:">Genesis 18:4</a>, <span class="ital">Wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; </span>and a full expression <a href="/esther/1-5.htm" title="And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both to great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;">Esther 1:5</a>, <span class="ital">The king made a feast in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.” </span>Dr. Horne also, after weighing what Mr. Harmer had advanced against it, adopts this interpretation, observing that Mr. Merrick, in his <span class="ital">Annotations, </span>produces some very good arguments in favour of it. The doctor’s comment is, “The vine, a lowly plant, raised with tender care, becoming, by its luxuriance, its beauty, its fragrance, and its clusters, the ornament and glory of the house to which it is joined, and by which it is supported, forms the finest imaginable emblem of a fair, virtuous, and fruitful wife. The olive-trees planted by the inhabitants of the eastern countries around their tables, or banqueting-places in their gardens, to cheer the eye by their verdure, and to refresh the body by their cooling shade, do no less aptly and significantly set forth the pleasure which parents feel at the side of a numerous and flourishing offspring.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/128.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>128:1-6 The blessings of those who fear God. - Only those who are truly holy, are truly happy. In vain do we pretend to be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping stedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord; whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear him and walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest, better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing of God, the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a double promise; they shall have something to do, for an idle life is a miserable, uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, and power of mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon the labours of other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, with quietness to work and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoy what they get. Such as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the only happy persons, whatever their station in life may be. They shall have abundant comfort in their family relations. And they shall have all the good things God has promised, and which they pray for. A good man can have little comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he sees peace upon Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity of the church. Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlasting peace and rest that remain for the Israel of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/128.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house - It is not uncommon in the East, as elsewhere, to train a vine along the sides of a house - partly to save ground; partly because it is a good exposure for fruit; partly as an ornament; and partly to protect it from thieves. Such a vine, in its beauty, and in the abundant clusters upon it, becomes a beautiful emblem of the mother of a numerous household. One of the blessings most desired and most valued in the East was a numerous posterity, and this, in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, was among the chief blessings which God promised to them - a posterity that should resemble in number the sands of the sea or the stars of heaven. Compare <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>.

Beautiful; producing abundance; sending up young plants to take the place of the old when they decay and die. The following extract and preceding cut from "The land and Book," vol. i., pp. 76, 77, will furnish a good illustration of this passage: "To what particular circumstance does David refer in the 128th Psalm, where he says, Thy children shall be like oliveplants round about thy table? Follow me into the grove, and I will show you what may have suggested the comparison. Here we have lilt upon a beautiful illustration. This aged and decayed tree is surrounded, as you see, by several young and thrifty shoots, which spring from the root of the venerable parent. They seem to uphold, protect, and embrace it. We may even fancy that they now bear that lead of fruit which would otherwise be demanded of the feeble parent. Thus do good and affectionate children gather round the table of the righteous. Each contributes something to the common wealth and welfare of the whole - a beautiful sight, with which may God refresh the eyes of every friend of mine." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/128.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. by the sides&#8212;or, "within" (Ps 48:2).<p>olive plants&#8212;are peculiarly luxuriant (Ps 52:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/128.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As a fruitful vine; </span> like the vine for fruitfulness; or like that sort of vines known by this name for its eminent fruitfulness, as some trees amongst us are for the same reason called <span class="ital">the great bearers.

The vine being a weak and tender tree, which needs propping and supporting; and often is fastened to the sides of a house, to which the allusion here is; whereunto it cleaves, and on which it runs up, and bears very agreeable fruit; it is properly used to express the weakness and tenderness of the female sex, their fruitfulness in bearing children, and their care of domestic affairs, being keepers at home; see <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>. Kimchi observes, that the vine is the only tree men plant within doors; which, when it is grown up, they bring out at a hole or window of the house without, to have the sun and air; and so its root is within the house, and the branches without: and he observes, that a modest woman is within the house, and does not go without, and is only seen by her husband; but her children, like the branches of the vine, go out to work. This may be applied to Christ and his church; to him the other characters agree: he, as man, is one that feared the Lord; the grace of fear was in him; the spirit of fear rested on him; and he was in the exercise of it, and walked in all the ways of the Lord, <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; he now sees and enjoys the travail or labour of his soul to satisfaction, and is made most blessed for evermore, <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>. The church is the bride, the Lamb's wife, the spouse of Christ; and may be compared to a vine for her weakness in herself, her fruitfulness in grace and good works, and in bringing forth souls to Christ, through the ministry of the word; all which is pleasant and grateful to him; see <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <p>thy children like olive plants round about thy table; a numerous offspring was always accounted a very great blessing; and it must be very pleasant to a parent to see his children round about his table, placed in their proper order according to their age, partaking of what it is furnished with: Job, in his time of prosperity, had many children; and, next to the presence of the Almighty with him, he mentions this of his children being about him; see <a href="/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2</a>. This may be applied to the spiritual seed and offspring of Christ, which are like to olive trees or olive plants; to which David is compared, <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; the two anointed ones in <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm">Zechariah 4:11</a>; the two witnesses in <a href="/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a>; and all true believers in Christ may; because of their excellency, these being choice plants; because of their fruitfulness and beauty; because of their fatness, and having oil in them; and because of their perpetuity, being ever green; see <a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>. Now Christ has a table, which he has well furnished, at which he himself sits, and places these his children all around; and whom he welcomes to the entertainment he makes, and takes delight and pleasure in them, Sol 1:12. Kimchi observes, the olive trees do not admit of a graft from other trees; see <a href="/romans/11-24.htm">Romans 11:24</a>; and so this denotes the legitimacy of those children, being free from all suspicion of being spurious, being born of such a wife as before described; and being green and moist all the year long, denotes their continuance in good works. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/128.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy wife <i>shall be</i> as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> children like olive plants round about thy table.</span><p>(c) Because God's favour appears in no outward thing more than in the increase of children, he promises to enrich the faithful with this gift.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/128.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">as a fruitful vine</span>] The fruitfulness, gracefulness, and preciousness of the vine are obvious points of comparison: its dependence and need of support may also be alluded to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the sides of thine house</span>] Rather, in the innermost chambers of thy house (Jer. <span class="ital">in penetralibus domus tuae</span>), to be connected with <span class="ital">thy wife</span>, as in the next line <span class="ital">round about thy table</span> obviously belongs to <span class="ital">thy children</span>.

The rearing of the house which affords us protection, and the stability of the city in which we securely and peaceably dwell, the acquisition of possessions that maintain and adorn life, the begetting and rearing of sons that may contribute substantial support to the father as he grows old - all these are things which depend upon the blessing of God without natural preliminary conditions being able to guarantee them, well-devised arrangements to ensure them, unwearied labours to obtain them by force, or impatient care and murmuring to get them by defiance. Many a man builds himself a house, but he is not able to carry out the building of it, or he dies before he is able to take possession of it, or the building fails through unforeseen misfortunes, or, if it succeeds, becomes a prey to violent destruction: if God Himself do not build it, they labour thereon (&#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="/jonah/4-10.htm">Jonah 4:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:21</a>) in vain who build it. Many a city is well-ordered, and seems to be secured by wise precautions against every misfortune, against fire and sudden attack; but if God Himself do not guard it, it is in vain that those to whom its protection is entrusted give themselves no sleep and perform (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, a word that has only come into frequent use since the literature of the Salomonic age) the duties of their office with the utmost devotion. The perfect in the apodosis affirms what has been done on the part of man to be ineffectual if the former is not done on God's part; cf. <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>. Many rise up early in order to get to their work, and delay the sitting down as along as possible; i.e., not: the lying down (Hupfeld), for that is &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;; but to take a seat in order to rest a little, and, as what follows shows, to eat (Hitzig). &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; stand opposed to one another: the latter cannot therefore mean to remain sitting at one's work, in favour of which <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a> (where &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; form an antithesis) cannot be properly compared. <a href="/1_samuel/20-24.htm">1 Samuel 20:24</a> shows that prior to the incursion of the Grecian custom they did not take their meals lying or reclining (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;- or &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), but sitting. It is vain for you - the poet exclaims to them - it will not after all bring hat you think to be able to acquire; in so doing you eat only the bread of sorrow, i.e., bread that is procured with toil and trouble (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;): &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, in like manner, i.e., the same as you are able to procure only by toilsome and anxious efforts, God gives to His beloved (<a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>)   &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488; ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;), in sleep (an adverbial accusative like &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;), i.e., without restless self-activity, in a state of self-forgetful renunciation, and modest, calm surrender to Him: "God bestows His gifts during the night," says a German proverb, and a Greek proverb even says: &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;.
