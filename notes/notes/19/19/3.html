(2) “It is not speech, it is not words <span class= "ital">whose </span>voice is inaudible,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>unintelligible, but, on the contrary, it is a manifestation to all the world.

They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God.

Hebrew, "without their voice heard." The idea in the margin, which is adopted by Prof. Alexander, is, that when the heavens give expression to the majesty and glory of God, it is not by words - by the use of language such as is employed among men. That is, there is a silent but real testimony to the power and glory of their great Author. The same idea is adopted substantially by DeWette. So Rosenmuller renders it, "There is no speech to them, and no words, neither is their voice heard." High as these authorities are, yet it seems to me that the idea conveyed by our common version is probably the correct one. This is the idea in the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. According to this interpretation the meaning is, "There is no nation, there are no men, whatever may be their language, to whom the heavens do not speak, declaring the greatness and glory of God. The language which they speak is universal; and however various the languages spoken by men, however impossible it may be for them to understand each other, yet all can understand the language of the heavens, proclaiming the perfections of the Great Creator. That is a universal language which does not need to be expressed in the forms of human speech, but which conveys great truths alike to all mankind."<p>That the passage cannot mean that there is no speech, that there are no words, or that there is no language in the lessons conveyed by the heavens, seems to me to be clear from the fact that alike in the previous verse <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>, and in the following verse <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a>, the psalmist says that they do use speech or language, "Day unto day uttereth speech;" "their words unto the end of the world." The phrase "their voice" refers to the heavens <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>. They utter a clear and distinct voice to mankind; that is, they convey to people true and just notions of the greatness of the Creator. The meaning, then, it seems to me, is that the same great lessons about God are conveyed by the heavens, in their glory and their revolutions, to all nations; that these lessons are conveyed to them day by day, and night by night; that however great may be the diversities of Speech among men, these convey lessons in a universal language understood by all mankind; and that thus God is making himself constantly known to all the dwellers on the earth. All people can understand the language of the heavens, though they may not be able to understand the language of each other. Of the truth of this no one can doubt; and its beauty is equal to its truth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Not the voice of the day and night; as if the sense was, that there is no people, of any speech or language under the sun, but there is something said every day and night of the weather, what it is, or will be, as the face of the heavens appears morning and evening: but of the heavens and firmament; the meaning of which some take to be this; either that though they have no proper speech nor language, yet there is a voice in them which is heard, declaring the glory of God and his handiworks; and the words may very well be rendered, "they have no speech nor words, without these their voice is heard"; or that there is no people, nation, or language under the heavens; see <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>; though they are ever so different one from another, so as not to be able to understand each other; yet the voice of the heavens, uttering and proclaiming the glory of their Maker, is heard and understood by them all: but rather this is to be interpreted of the extent of the Gospel ministry by the apostles; who, according to their commission, went everywhere preaching the word, to men of all nations, of every speech and language; for which they were qualified, by having the gift of various tongues bestowed upon them; so that there were no nations, of ever so barbarous a speech and language, but they were capable of speaking to and of being understood by them; and though they could not understand one another, they all heard the apostles speak in their own tongues the wonderful works of God, <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>. Their voice, in the ministration of the Gospel, was heard in every nation externally, and by many internally: faith came by hearing; and they received the word with gladness and readiness. This gives the Gospel revelation a superiority to the legal one; that was only made to one nation, to the nation of the Jews; the voice of that was not heard elsewhere; but the voice of the Gospel is heard in all nations; this revelation is published throughout the world: and this shows that these words belong to the times of the apostles, after they had received a commission from Christ, to go into, all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; which was done before the destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; and which is further confirmed by what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>There is</i> no speech nor <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> language, <i>where</i> their voice is not heard.</span><p>(c) The heavens are a schoolmaster to all nations, no matter how barbarous.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

Like the (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;) &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; which is always doxological, &#1495;&#1497; &#1492; (vivus Jahve) is meant as a predicate clause, but is read with the accent of an exclamation just as in the formula of an oath, which is the same expression; and in the present instance it has a doxological meaning. Accordingly &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; also signifies "exalted be," in which sense it is written &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;) in the other text. There are three doxological utterances drawn from the events which have just been celebrated in song. That which follows, from &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; onwards, describes Jahve once more as the living, blessed (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;), and exalted One, which He has shown Himself to be. From &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; we see that &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503; is to be resolved as an imperfect. The proofs of vengeance, &#1504;&#1511;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, are called God's gift, insofar as He has rendered it possible to him to punish the attacks upon his own dignity and the dignity of his people, or to witness the punishment of such insults (e.g., in the case of Nabal); for divine vengeance is a securing by punishment (vindicatio) of the inviolability of the right. It is questionable whether &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; (synonym &#1512;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>) here and in <a href="/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> means "to bring to reason" as an intensive of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to drive (Ges.); the more natural meaning is "to turn the back" according to the Arabic adbara (Hitzig), cf. dabar, dabre, flight, retreat; debira to be wounded behind; medbu&#770;r, wounded in the back. The idea from which &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; gains the meaning "to subdue" is that of flight, in which hostile nations, overtaken from behind, sank down under him (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>); but the idea that is fully worked out in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>, is by no means remote. With &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; the assertion takes the form of an address. &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; does not differ from <a href="/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a> : Thou liftest me up away from mine enemies, so that I hover above them and triumph over them. The climactic &#1488;&#1507;, of which poetry is fond, here unites two thoughts of a like import to give intensity of expression to the one idea. The participle is followed by futures: his manifold experience is concentrated in one general ideal expression. </body></html>
