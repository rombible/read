There is a reward, not only after keeping, but in keeping God's commandments. Religion makes our comforts sweet, and our crosses easy, life truly valuable, and death itself truly desirable. David not only desired to be pardoned and cleansed from the sins he had discovered and confessed, but from those he had forgotten or overlooked. All discoveries of sin made to us by the law, should drive us to the throne of grace, there to pray. His dependence was the same with that of every Christian who says, Surely in the Lord Jesus have I righteousness and strength. No prayer can be acceptable before God which is not offered in the strength of our Redeemer or Divine Kinsman, through Him who took our nature upon him, that he might redeem us unto God, and restore the long-lost inheritance. May our hearts be much affected with the excellence of the word of God; and much affected with the evil of sin, and the danger we are in of it, and the danger we are in by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the words of my mouth - The words that I speak; all the words that Ispeak.<p>And the meditation of my heart - The thoughts of my heart.<p>Be acceptable in thy sight - Be such as thou wilt approve; or, be such as will be pleasing to thee; such as will give thee delight or satisfaction; such as will be agreeable to thee.

The psalm, therefore, which begins with a contemplation of God in his works, appropriately closes with a contemplation of God in redemption; or brings before us the great thought that it is not by the knowledge of God as we can gain it from his works of creation that we are to be saved, but that the most endearing character in which he can be manifested to us is in the work of redemption, and that wherever we begin in our contemplation of God, it becomes us to end in the contemplation of his character as our Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14. The clearer our view of the law, the more manifest are our sins.

The word of nature declares &#1488;&#1500; (God) to us, the word of Scripture &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (Jahve); the former God's power and glory, the latter also His counsel and will. Now follow twelve encomiums of the Law, of which every two are related as antecedent and consequent, rising and falling according to the caesural schema, after the manner of waves. One can discern how now the heart of the poet begins to beat with redoubled joy as he comes to speak of God's word, the revelation of His will. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; does not in itself mean the law, but a pointing out, instruction, doctrine or teaching, and more particularly such as is divine, and therefore positive; whence it is also used of prophecy, <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>, and prophetically of the New Testament gospel, <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>. But here no other divine revelation is meant than that given by the mediation of Moses, which is become the law, i.e., the rule of life (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), of Israel; and this law, too, as a whole not merely as to its hortatory and disciplinary character, but also including the promises contained in it. The praises which the poet pronounces upon the Law, are accurate even from the standpoint of the New Testament. Even Paul says, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>, "The Law is holy and spiritual, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." The Law merits these praises in itself; and to him who is in a state of favour, it is indeed no longer a law bringing a curse with it, but a mirror of the God merciful in holiness, into which he can look without slavish fear, and is a rule for the direction of his free and willing obedience. And how totally different is the affection of the psalmists and prophets for the Law, - an affection based upon the essence and universal morality of the commandments, and upon a spiritual realisation of the letter, and the consolation of the promises, - from the pharisaical rabbinical service of the letter and the ceremonial in the period after the Exile!<p>The divine Law is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, "perfect," i.e., spotless and harmless, as being absolutely well-meaning, and altogether directed towards the well-being of man. And &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; restoring, bringing back, i.e., imparting newness of life, quickening the soul (cf. Pil. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>), to him, viz., who obeys the will of God graciously declared therein, and enters upon the divine way or rule of salvation. Then in the place of the word &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; we find &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, - as the tables of the Ten Commandments (&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) are called, - from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;), which signifies not merely a corroborative, but also a warning and instructive testimony or attestation.  The testimony of Jahve is &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, made firm, sure, faithful, i.e., raised above all doubt in its declarations, and verifying itself in its threatenings and promises; and hence &#1502;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, making wise simplicity, or the simple, lit., openness, the open (root &#1508;&#1514; to spread out, open, Indo-Germ. prat, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;, pat, pad), i.e., easily led astray; to such an one it gives a solid basis and stability, &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>.  The Law divides into &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, precepts or declarations concerning man's obligation; these are &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, straight or upright, as a norma normata, because they proceed from the upright, absolutely good will of God, and as a norma normans they lead along a straight way in the right track. They are therefore &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;, their educative guidance, taking one as it were by the hand, frees one from all tottering, satisfies a moral want, and preserves a joyous consciousness of being in the right way towards the right goal. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, Jahve's statute (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; statuere), is the tenour of His commandments. The statute is a lamp - it is said in <a href="/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> -and the law a light. So here: it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, clear, like the light of the sun (Sol 6:10), and its light is imparted to other objects: &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, enlightening the eyes, which refers not merely to the enlightening of the understanding, but of one's whole condition; it makes the mind clear, and body as well as mind healthy and fresh, for the darkness of the eyes is sorrow, melancholy, and bewilderment. In this chain of names for the Law, &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; is not the fear of God as an act performed, but as a precept, it is what God's revelation demands, effects, and maintains; so that it is the revealed way in which God is to be feared (<a href="/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a>) - in short, it is the religion of Jahve (cf. <a href="/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a> with <a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>). This is &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, clean, pure, as the word which is like to pure gold, by which it is taught, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>, cf. <a href="/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>; and therefore &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, enduring for ever in opposition to all false forms of reverencing God, which carry their own condemnation in themselves. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497; &#1492; are the jura of the Law as a corpus juris divini, everything that is right and constitutes right according to the decision of Jahve. These judgments are &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, truth, which endures and verifies itself; because, in distinction from most others and those outside Israel, they have an unchangeable moral foundation: &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, i.e., they are &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, in accordance with right and appropriate (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-8.htm">Deuteronomy 4:8</a>), altogether, because no reproach of inappositeness and sanctioned injustice or wrong clings to them. The eternal will of God has attained a relatively perfect form and development in the Law of Jahve according to the standard set up as the law of the nation. </body></html>
