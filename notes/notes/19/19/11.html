There is a reward, not only after keeping, but in keeping God's commandments. Religion makes our comforts sweet, and our crosses easy, life truly valuable, and death itself truly desirable. David not only desired to be pardoned and cleansed from the sins he had discovered and confessed, but from those he had forgotten or overlooked. All discoveries of sin made to us by the law, should drive us to the throne of grace, there to pray. His dependence was the same with that of every Christian who says, Surely in the Lord Jesus have I righteousness and strength. No prayer can be acceptable before God which is not offered in the strength of our Redeemer or Divine Kinsman, through Him who took our nature upon him, that he might redeem us unto God, and restore the long-lost inheritance. May our hearts be much affected with the excellence of the word of God; and much affected with the evil of sin, and the danger we are in of it, and the danger we are in by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover by them is thy servant warned - The word used here - &#1494;&#1492;&#1512;  za&#770;har - means, properly, to be bright, to shine; then, to cause to shine, to make light; and then, to admonish, to instruct, to warn. The essential idea here is, to throw light on a subject, so as to show it clearly; that is, to make the duty plain, and the consequences plain.

It does not occur elsewhere.<p>And in keeping of them there is great reward - Either as the result of keeping them, or in the act of keeping them. In the former sense it would mean that a careful observance of the laws of God will be followed by rewards hereafter; in the other sense, that the act of keeping them will be attended with so much peace and happiness as to constitute of itself an ample reward. In both these senses is the assertion here made a correct one. Both will be found to be true. It is not easy to determine which is the true sense. Perhaps the language implies both. The phrase "thy servant" refers to the author of the psalm, and shows that in this part of the psalm, in speaking of the "sweetness" of the law of God, and of its value as perceived by the soul, and of the effect of keeping that law, he is referring to his own experience. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9.

Hence it revives those depressed by doubts, makes wise the unskilled (2Ti 3:15), rejoices the lover of truth, strengthens the desponding (Ps 13:4; 34:6), provides permanent principles of conduct, and by God's grace brings a rich reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy servant; </span> I thy servant, though a king and a prophet, and of some repute for wisdom and knowledge, yet I am daily taught by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Warned, </span> or, <span class="ital">enlightened</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a></span>; or clearly admonished, as this word signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/18-20.htm" title="And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.">Exodus 18:20</a> <a href="/2_kings/6-10.htm" title="And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.">2 Kings 6:10</a> <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm" title="Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a> <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm" title="Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.">Ezekiel 3:17</a></span>, &c.; <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/33-3.htm" title="If when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;">Ezekiel 33:3</a>,9</span>.

This verse is a sort of connecting link between the second and the third parts of the psalm.

The measuring line of the heavens is gone forth into all the earth, i.e., has taken entire possession of the earth. <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> tells us what kind of measuring line is intended, viz., that of their heraldship: their words (from &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which is more Aramaic than Hebrew, and consequently more poetic) reach to the end of the world, they fill it completely, from its extreme boundary inwards. Isaiah's &#1511;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1-9</a> :10, is inapplicable here, because it does not mean commandment, but rule, and is there used as a word of derision, rhyming with &#1510;&#1493;. The &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; of the lxx (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; Symm.) might more readily be justified, inasmuch as &#1511;&#1493; might mean a harpstring, as being a cord in tension, and then, like &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (cf. &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), a tone or sound (Gesenius in his Lex., and Ewald), if the reading &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; does not perhaps lie at the foundation of that rendering. But the usage of the language presents with signification of a measuring line for &#1511;&#1493; when used with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; (Aq. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>); and this gives a new thought, whereas in the other case we should merely have a repetition of what has been already expressed in <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a>. Paul makes use of these first two lines of the strophe in order, with its very words, to testify to the spread of the apostolic message over the whole earth. Hence most of the older expositors have taken the first half of the Psalm to be an allegorical prediction, the heavens being a figure of the church and the sun a figure of the gospel. The apostle does not, however, make a formal citation in the passage referred to, he merely gives a New Testament application to Old Testament language, by taking the all-penetrating praeconium coelorum as figure of the all-penetrating praeconium evangelii; and he is fully justified in so doing by the parallel which the psalmist himself draws between the revelation of God in nature and in the written word.<p>The reference of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is at once opposed by the tameness of the thought so obtained. The tent, viz., the retreat (&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;, according to its radical meaning a dwelling, from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;, cogn. &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, to retire from the open country) of the sun is indeed in the sky, but it is more naturally at the spot where the sky and the &#1511;&#1510;&#1492; &#1514;&#1489;&#1500; meet. Accordingly &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; has the neuter signification "there" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>); and there is so little ground for reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, as Ewald does, that the poet on the contrary has written &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; and not &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, because he has just used &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; (Hitzig). The name of the sun, which is always feminine in Arabic, is predominantly masculine in Hebrew and Aramaic (cf. on the other hand <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>, <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>); just as the Sabians and heathen Arabs had a sun-god (masc.). Accordingly in <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a> the sun is compared to a bridegroom, who comes forth in the morning out of his &#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;. <a href="/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16</a> shows that this word means a bride-chamber; properly (from &#1495;&#1508;&#1507; to cover) it means a canopy (<a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>), whence in later Hebrew the bridal or portable canopy (Talmud. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1488;), which is supported by four poles and borne by four boys, at the consecration of the bridal pair, and then also the marriage itself, is called chuppa. The morning light has in it a freshness and cheerfulness, as it were a renewed youth. Therefore the morning sun is compared to a bridegroom, the desire of whose heart is satisfied, who stands as it were at the beginning of a new life, and in whose youthful countenance the joy of the wedding-day still shines. And as at its rising it is like a bridegroom, so in its rapid course (Sir. 43:5) it is like a hero (vid., on <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>), inasmuch as it marches on its way ever anew, light-giving and triumphant, as often as it comes forth, with &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>). From one end of heaven, the extreme east of the horizon, is its going forth, i.e., rising (cf. <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>; the opposite is &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; going in  equals  setting), and its circuit (&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  equals  &#1504;&#1511;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, to revolve) &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, to their (the heavens') end ( equals  &#1506;&#1491; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>), cf. 1 Esdr. 4:34: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837;. On this open way there is not &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, anything hidden, i.e., anything that remains hidden, before its heat. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is the enlightening and warming influence of the sun, which is also itself called &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in poetry. </body></html>
