To recover man out of his fallen state, there is need of the word of God. The word translated law, may be rendered doctrine, and be understood as meaning all that teaches us true religion. The whole is perfect; its tendency is to convert or turn the soul from sin and the world, to God and holiness. It shows our sinfulness and misery in departing from God, and the necessity of our return to him. This testimony is sure, to be fully depended on: the ignorant and unlearned believing what God saith, become wise unto salvation. It is a sure direction in the way of duty. It is a sure fountain of living comforts, and a sure foundation of lasting hopes. The statues of the Lord are right, just as they should be; and, because they are right, they rejoice the heart. The commandments of the Lord are pure, holy, just, and good. By them we discover our need of a Saviour; and then learn how to adorn his gospel. They are the means which the Holy Spirit uses in enlightening the eyes; they bring us to a sight and sense of our sin and misery, and direct us in the way of duty. The fear of the Lord, that is, true religion and godliness, is clean, it will cleanse our way; and it endureth for ever. The ceremonial law is long since done away, but the law concerning the fear of God is ever the same. The judgments of the Lord, his precepts, are true; they are righteous, and they are so altogether; there is no unrighteousness in any of them. Gold is only for the body, and the concerns of time; but grace is for the soul, and the concerns of eternity. The word of God, received by faith, is more precious than gold; it is sweet to the soul, sweeter than honey. The pleasure of sense soon surfeit, yet never satisfy; but those of religion are substantial and satisfying; there is no danger of excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fear of the Lord - The word rendered fear in this place - &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  yir'a&#770;h - means properly fear, terror, <a href="/jonah/1-10.htm">Jonah 1:10</a>; then, reverence, or holy fear, <a href="/psalms/2-11.htm">Psalm 2:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; and hence, reverence toward God, piety, religion - in which sense it is often used. Compare <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>. Hence, by metonymy, it means the precepts of piety or religion. It is used evidently in this sense here, as referring to revelation, or to revealed truth, in the sense that it promotes proper reverence for God, or secures a proper regard for his name and worship.<p>Is clean - The word used here - &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;  t&#803;a&#770;ho&#770;r - means properly clear, pure, in a physical sense, as opposed to filthy, soiled; then, in a ceremonial sense, as opposed to that which is profane or common <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-17.htm">Leviticus 13:17</a>, and then, in a moral sense, as a clean heart, etc., <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>. It is also applied to pure gold, <a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>. The sense here is, that there is nothing in it that tends to corrupt the morals, or defile the soul. Everything connected with it is of a pure or holy tendency, adapted to cleanse the soul and to make it holy.<p>Enduring for ever - Standing to all eternity. Not temporary; not decaying; not destined to pass away. It stands firm now, and it will stand firm for ever. That is, the law of God, considered as adapted to make the heart holy and pure, is eternal. What it is now it will always be. What its teaching is now it will continue to be forever.<p>The judgments of the Lord - The word here rendered judgments refers also to the revealed truth of God, with the idea that that has been judged or determined by him to be right and to be best. It is the result of the divine adjudication as to what is true, and what is best for man. The word is often used in this sense. Compare <a href="/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>.<p>Are true - Margin, truth. So the Hebrew. That is, they accord entirely with the truth, or are a correct representation of the reality of things. They are not arbitrary, but are in accordance with what is right. This supposes that there is such a thing as truth in itself, and the divine law conforms to that; not that God determines a thing by mere will, and that it is, therefore, right. God is infinitely perfect, and what he does will be always right, for that is in, accordance with his nature; but still his judgments are right, not because he makes that to be right which is determined by his will, but because his will is always in accordance with what is right.<p>And righteous altogether - That is, they are, without exception, just; or, they are altogether or wholly righteous. There is no one of them which is not just and proper. All that God determines, whether in giving or in executing his laws - all in his requirements, and all in the administration of his government - is always and wholly righteous. It is precisely what it should be in the case, and is, therefore, worthy of universal confidence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. The law is described by six names, epithets, and effects. It is a rule, God's testimony for the truth, His special and general prescription of duty, fear (as its cause) and judicial decision. It is distinct and certain, reliable, right, pure, holy, and true. Hence it revives those depressed by doubts, makes wise the unskilled (2Ti 3:15), rejoices the lover of truth, strengthens the desponding (Ps 13:4; 34:6), provides permanent principles of conduct, and by God's grace brings a rich reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The fear of the Lord; </span> by which he understands not the grace of God’s fear, as this phrase is commonly taken; nor the whole worship of God, as it is taken <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/34-9.htm" title="O fear the LORD, you his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.">Psalm 34:9</a>,11 Mt 15:9</span>; but the law and word of God, which is the only thing that is here commended, and which is meant by all the other parallel titles of his <span class="ital">testimony</span>, and <span class="ital">statutes</span>, and <span class="ital">commandments</span>, and <span class="ital">judgments</span>, and consequently by this of his <span class="ital">fear</span>, which is as it were hemmed in within them.

Hengstenberg explains "the fear of the Lord" in this place as "the instruction afforded by God for fearing him." And certainly, unless we adopt some such explanation, we shall find it difficult to account for the intrusion of the clause into its present position. The Law, the testimony, the statutes (or precepts), the commandment (vers. 7, 8), and the judgments (ver. 9), are external to man, objective; the fear of the Lord. as commonly understood, is internal, subjective, a "settled habit of his soul." It is not a thing of the same kind with the other five nominatives, and appears out of place among them. Hence it seems best, with Professor Alexander, to adopt Hengstenberg's explanation. The Law, viewed as teaching the fear of God, is undoubtedly "clean " - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pure, perfect - and "endures for ever," or is of perpetual obligation. <span class="cmt_word">The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether</span>. In "judgments" we have another of the recognized synonyms for the entire Law (<a href="/psalms/119-7.htm">Psalm 119:7, 13, 43, 52, 62</a>), which is from first to last "exceeding righteous and true" (<a href="/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a>, Prayer-book Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 19:2-4) The heavens, i.e., the superterrestrial spheres, which, so far as human vision is concerned, are lost in infinite space, declare how glorious is God, and indeed &#1488;&#1500;, as the Almighty; and what His hands have made, i.e., what He has produced with a superior power to which everything is possible, the firmament, i.e., vault of heaven stretched out far and wide and as a transparency above the earth (Graeco-Veneta &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, from &#1512;&#1511;&#1506;, root &#1512;&#1511;, to stretch, &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), distinctly expresses. The sky and firmament are not conceived of as conscious beings which the middle ages, in dependence upon Aristotle (vid., Maimonides, More Nebuchim ii. 5), believed could be proved fro this passage, cf. <a href="/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>; <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>. Moreover, Scripture knows nothing of the "music of the spheres" of the Pythagoreans. What is meant is, as the old expositors correctly say, objectivum vocis non articulatae praeconium. The doxa, which God has conferred upon the creature as the reflection of His own, is reflected back from it, and given back to God as it were in acknowledgment of its origin. The idea of perpetuity, which lies even in the participle, is expanded in <a href="/psalms/19-3.htm">Psalm 19:3</a>. The words of this discourse of praise are carried forward in an uninterrupted line of transmission. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; (fr. &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. nb&#8219;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to gush forth, nearly allied to which, however, is also the root &#1489;&#1506;, to spring up) points to the rich fulness with which, as from an inexhaustible spring, the testimony passes on from one day to the next. The parallel word &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is an unpictorial, but poetic, word that is more Aramaic than Hebrew ( equals  &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;). &#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; also belongs to the more elevated style; the &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; deposited in the creature, although not reflected, is here called &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;. The poet does not say that the tidings proclaimed by the day, if they gradually die away as the day declines, are taken up by the night, and the tidings of the night by the day; but (since the knowledge proclaimed by the day concerns the visible works of God by day, and that proclaimed by the night, His works by night), that each dawning day continues the speech of that which has declined, and each approaching night takes up the tale of that which has passed away (Psychol. S. 347, tr. p. 408). If <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> were to be rendered "there is no speech and there are no words, their voice is inaudible," i.e., they are silent, speechless witnesses, uttering no sound, but yet speaking aloud (Hengst.), only inwardly audible but yet intelligible everywhere (Then.): then, <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> ought at least to begin with a Waw adversativum, and, moreover, the poet would then needlessly check his fervour, producing a tame thought and one that interrupts the flow of the hymn. To take <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> as a circumstantial clause to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>, and made to precede it, as Ewald does, "without loud speech...their sound has resounded through all the earth" (341, d), is impossible, even apart from the fact of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; not meaning "Loud speech" and &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; hardly "their sound." <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> is in the form of an independent sentence, and there is nothing whatever in it to betray any designed subordination to <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>. But if it be made independent in the sense "there is no loud, no articulate speech, no audible voice, which proceeds from the heavens," then <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> would form an antithesis to it; and this, in like manner, there is nothing to indicate, and it would at least require that the verb &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; should be placed first. Luther's rendering is better: There is no language nor speech, where their voice is not heard, i.e., as Calvin also renders it, the testimony of the heavens to God is understood by the peoples of every language and tongue. But this ought to be &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492; ro &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  (<a href="/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a>). Hofmann's rendering is similar, but more untenable: "There is no speech and there are no words, that their cry is not heard, i.e., the language of the heavens goes forth side by side with all other languages; and men may discourse ever so, still the speech or sound of the heavens is heard therewith, it sounds above them all." But the words are not &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (after the analogy of <a href="/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>), or rather &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (as in <a href="/job/41-8.htm">Job 41:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; with the part. is a poetical expression for the Alpha privat. (<a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>), consequently &#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is "unheard" or "inaudible," and the opposite of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, audible, <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. Thus, therefore, the only rendering that remains is that of the lxx., Vitringa, and Hitzig: There is no language and no words, whose voice is unheard, i.e., inaudible. Hupfeld's assertion that this rendering destroys the parallelism is unfounded. The structure of the distich resembles <a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a>. The discourse of the heavens and the firmament, of the day (of the sky by day) and of the night (of the sky by night), is not a discourse uttered in a corner, it is a discourse in speech that is everywhere audible, and in words that are understood by all, a &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>. </body></html>
