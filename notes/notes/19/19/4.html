They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God.

The word used here - &#1511;&#1493;  qav - means properly a cord, or line:<p>(a) a measuring line, <a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>; <a href="/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a>; and then<p>(b) a cord or string as of a lyre or other instrument of music; and hence, a sound.<p>So it is rendered here by the Septuagint, &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  phthongos. By Symmachus, &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  e&#772;chos. By the Vulgate, sonus. DeWette renders it Klang, sound. Prof. Alexander dogmatically says that this is "entirely at variance with the Hebrew usage." That this sense, however, is demanded in the passage seems to be plain, not only from the sense given to it by the ancient versions, but by the parallelism, where the term "words" corresponds to it:<p>"Their line is gone out through all the earth;<p>Their words to the end of the world."<p>Besides, what could be the sense of saying that their line, in the sense of a measuring line, or cord, had gone through all the earth? The plain meaning is, that sounds conveying instruction, and here connected with the idea of sweet or musical sounds, had gone out from the heavens to all parts of the world, conveying the knowledge of God. There is no allusion to the notion of the "music of the spheres," for this conception was not known to the Hebrews; but the idea is that of sweet or musical sounds, not harsh or grating, as proceeding from the movements of the heavens, and conveying these lessons to man.<p>And their words - The lessons or truths which they convey.<p>To the end of the world - To the uttermost parts of the earth. The language here is derived from the idea that the earth was a plane, and had limits. But even with our correct knowledge of the figure of the earth, we use similar language when we speak of the "uttermost parts of the earth."<p>In them - That is, in the heavens, <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>. The meaning is, that the sun has his abode or dwelling-place, as it were, in the heavens. The sun is particularly mentioned, doubtless, as being the most prominent object among the heavenly bodies, as illustrating in an eminent manner the glory of God. The sense of the whole passage is, that the heavens in general proclaim the glory of God, and that this is shown in a particular and special manner by the light, the splendor, and the journeyings of the sun.<p>Hath he set a tabernacle for the sun - A tent; that is, a dwelling-place. He has made a dwelling-place there for the sun.

It is much disputed what "their <span class="accented">line"</span> means. The word used, <span class="accented">qav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span>), means, ordinarily, a "measuring-line" (<a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>: <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, etc.), whence it comes to have the further sense of a terminus or boundary; that which the measuring-line marks out. It is also thought to have signified an architect's rule; and, hence, anything regulative, as a decree, precept, or law (see <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>). The LXX. translated it in this place by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a musical sound;" and Dr. Kay supposes "the regulative chord," or "key-note." to be intended. Perhaps "decree" would be in this place the best rendering, since it would suit the "words" (<span class="accented">minim</span>) of the second clause. The "decree" of the heavens is one proclaiming the glory of God, and the duty of all men to worship him. <span class="cmt_word">And their words to the end of the world</span>. Though they have neither speech nor language, nor any articulate words, yet they have "words" in a certain sense. <span class="accented">Millim is</span> said to be used of thoughts just shaping themselves into language, but not yet uttered (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun</span>. God has made the heavens the sun's dwelling-place, the place where he passes the day. There is, perhaps, a tacit allusion to the Shechinah, which dwelt in the tabernacle of the congregation: <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:47-49) The hymn now draws towards the end with praise and thanksgiving for the multitude of God's mighty deeds, which have just been displayed. Like the (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;) &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; which is always doxological, &#1495;&#1497; &#1492; (vivus Jahve) is meant as a predicate clause, but is read with the accent of an exclamation just as in the formula of an oath, which is the same expression; and in the present instance it has a doxological meaning. Accordingly &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; also signifies "exalted be," in which sense it is written &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;) in the other text. There are three doxological utterances drawn from the events which have just been celebrated in song. That which follows, from &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; onwards, describes Jahve once more as the living, blessed (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;), and exalted One, which He has shown Himself to be. From &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; we see that &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503; is to be resolved as an imperfect. The proofs of vengeance, &#1504;&#1511;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, are called God's gift, insofar as He has rendered it possible to him to punish the attacks upon his own dignity and the dignity of his people, or to witness the punishment of such insults (e.g., in the case of Nabal); for divine vengeance is a securing by punishment (vindicatio) of the inviolability of the right. It is questionable whether &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; (synonym &#1512;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>) here and in <a href="/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> means "to bring to reason" as an intensive of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to drive (Ges.); the more natural meaning is "to turn the back" according to the Arabic adbara (Hitzig), cf. dabar, dabre, flight, retreat; debira to be wounded behind; medbu&#770;r, wounded in the back. The idea from which &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; gains the meaning "to subdue" is that of flight, in which hostile nations, overtaken from behind, sank down under him (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>); but the idea that is fully worked out in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>, is by no means remote. With &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; the assertion takes the form of an address. &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; does not differ from <a href="/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a> : Thou liftest me up away from mine enemies, so that I hover above them and triumph over them. The climactic &#1488;&#1507;, of which poetry is fond, here unites two thoughts of a like import to give intensity of expression to the one idea. The participle is followed by futures: his manifold experience is concentrated in one general ideal expression. </body></html>
