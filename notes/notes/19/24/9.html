We are to conceive him gradually rising from mount Olivet into the air, taking the clouds for his chariot, and ascending up on high; while some of the angels, like the Levites in procession, attendant on the triumphant Messiah, in the day of his power, demand that those everlasting gates and doors, hitherto shut and barred against the race of Adam, should be thrown open, for his admission into the realms of bliss. <span class="ital">Lift up your heads, </span>&c. — On hearing this voice of jubilee and exultation from the earth, the abode of misery and sorrow, the rest of the angels, astonished at the thought of a <span class="ital">man </span>claiming a right of entrance into their happy regions, ask, from within, like the Levites in the temple, <span class="ital">Who is this King of glory? </span>To which question the attendant angels answer, in a strain of joy and triumph — and let the church of the redeemed answer with them — <span class="ital">The Lord strong and mighty, </span>&c. — The LORD JESUS, victorious over sin, death, and hell.

We may also apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven, and the welcome given to him there. Our Redeemer found the gates of heaven shut, but having by his blood made atonement for sin, as one having authority, he demanded entrance. The angels were to worship him, Heb 1:6: they ask with wonder, Who is he? It is answered, that he is strong and mighty; mighty in battle to save his people, and to subdue his and their enemies. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into the souls of men by his word and Spirit, that they may be his temples. Behold, he stands at the door, and knocks, Rev 3:20. The gates and doors of the heart are to be opened to him, as possession is delivered to the rightful owner. We may apply it to his second coming with glorious power. Lord, open the everlasting door of our souls by thy grace, that we may now receive thee, and be wholly thine; and that, at length, we may be numbered with thy saints in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up your heads ... - The repetition here is designed to give force and emphasis to what is uttered.

The design is to announce in a solemn manner that the symbol of the divine presence and majesty was about to be introduced into the place of its permanent abode, and that this was an event worthy to be celebrated; that even the gates of the city should voluntarily open themselves to admit the great and glorious King who was to reign there forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-10.

This is repeated on account of the backwardness and negligence of churches, and particular believers, to open and let Christ in; as may be seen in the case of the church in Sol 5:2; as well as the more to set forth the greatness and glory of Christ, about to make his entrance, and to command a proper awe and reverence of him: some think respect is had to the twofold coming of Christ; first into the second temple, and next at the last judgment; though rather the certainty of his coming, in a spiritual manner, to his church and people, is here designed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">even lift</span> &c.] Yea, lift them up … that the King of glory may come in.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">9, 10</span>.

A Talmudic teacher, B. Berachoth 35a, infers from this passage the duty of prayer before meat: He who eats without giving thanks is like one who lays hands upon &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (the sacred things of God); the right to eat is only obtained by prayer.)<p>For He, &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, is the owner of the world, because its Creator. He has founded it upon seas, i.e., the ocean and its streams, &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (<a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>); for the waters existed before the dry land, and this has been cast up out of them at God's word, so that consequently the solid land, - which indeed also conceals in its interior a &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), - rising above the surface of the sea, has the waters, as it were, for its foundation (<a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>), although it would more readily sink down into them than keep itself above them, if it were not in itself upheld by the creative power of God. Hereupon arises the question, who may ascend the mountain of Jahve, and stand above in His holy place? The futures have a potential signification: who can have courage to do it? what, therefore, must he be, whom Jahve receives into His fellowship, and with whose worship He is well-pleased? Answer: he must be one innocent in his actions and pure in mind, one who does not lift up his soul to that which is vain (&#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, according to the Masora with Waw minusculum). (&#1500;) &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;, to direct one's soul, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a>, or longing and striving, towards anything, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>. The Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is old and acknowledged by the oldest authorities.<p>(Note: The reading &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is adopted by Saadia (in Enumoth ii., where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;), Juda ha-Levi (Cuzari iii. 27), Abulwalid (Rikma p. 180), Rashi, Kimchi, the Sohar, the Codices (and among others by that of the year 1294) and most editions (among which, the Complutensis has &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in the text). Nor does Aben-Ezra, whom Norzi has misunderstood, by any means reverse the relation of the Chethb and Ker; to him &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the Ker, and he explains it as a metaphor (an anthropomorphism): &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;. Elias Levita is the only one who rejects the Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but he does so though misunderstanding a Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130) and not without admitting Masoretic testimony in favour of it (&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1495;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;). He is the only textual critic who rejects it. For Jacob b. Chajim is merely astonished that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not to be found in the Masoreth register of words written with Waw and to be read with Jod. And even Norzi does not reject this Ker, which he is obliged to admit has greatly preponderating testimony in its favour, and he would only too gladly get rid of it.)<p>Even the lxx Cod. Alex. translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; whereas Cod. Vat. (Eus., Apollin., Theodor., et al.): &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Critically it is just as intangible, as it is exegetically incomprehensible; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might then be equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, an explanation, however, which does not seem possible even from <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. We let this Ker&#1502; alone to its undisturbed critical rights. But that the poet did actually write thus, is incredible.<p>In <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> (just as at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a>), in continued predicates, we are told the character of the man, who is worthy of this privilege, to whom the question in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> refers. Such an one shall bear away, or acquire (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, as e.g., <a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>) blessing from Jahve and righteousness from the God of his salvation (<a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>). Righteousness, i.e., conformity to God and that which is well-pleasing to God, appears here as a gift, and in this sense it is used interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>). It is the righteousness of God after which the righteous, but not the self-righteous, man hungers and thirsts; that moral perfection which is the likeness of God restored to him and at the same time brought about by his own endeavours; it is the being changed, or transfigured, into the image of the Holy One Himself. With <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> the answer to the question of <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> is at an end; <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> adds that those thus qualified, who may accordingly expect to receive God's gifts of salvation, are the true church of Jahve, the Israel of God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (lit., a revolution, Arabic dahr, root &#1491;&#1512;, to turn, revolve) is used here, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, of a collective whole, whose bond of union is not contemporaneousness, but similarity of disposition; and it is an alliteration with the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; (Chethb &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;, without the Jod plur.) which follows. &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is a second genitive depending on &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, as in <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>. Here at the close the predication passes into the form of invocation (Thy face). And &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is a summarising predicate: in short, these are Jacob, not merely after the flesh, but after the spirit, and thus in truth (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>, cf. <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). By interpolating &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, as is done in the lxx and Peshto, and adopted by Ewald, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher, the nerve, as it were, of the assertion is cut through. The predicate, which has been expressed in different ways, is concentrated intelligibly enough in the one word &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, towards which it all along tends. And here the music becomes forte. The first part of this double Psalm dies away amidst the playing of the instruments of the Levitical priests; for the Ark was brought in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) is to be read. </body></html>
