Even those of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own their relation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, and that it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascending toward God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in that happy, holy place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We make nothing of religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only be cleansed from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood of Christ and the washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people; thus we receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of our salvation. God's peculiar people shall be made truly and for ever happy. Where God gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Those that are made meet for heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, and will find what they have been seeking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall receive the blessing from the Lord - literally, "He shall bear away a blessing from Yahweh." The blessing here referred to means His favor and friendship. He shall be recognized and treated as His. In other words, God bestows His favor on those who possess the character here referred to.<p>And righteousness from the God of his salvation - He shall be regarded and treated as righteous. Or, he shall obtain the divine approval as a righteous person. The idea of the psalmist would seem to be, not that he would obtain this as if it were a gift, but that he would obtain the divine "approval" of his character as righteous; he would be recognized and dealt with as a righteous man. He would come to God with "clean hands and a pure heart" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, and would be welcomed and treated as a friend of God. The wicked and the impure could not hope to obtain this; but he who was thus righteous would be treated according to his real character, and would meet with the assurances of the divine favor. It is as true now as it was in the days of the psalmist, that it is only the man who is in fact upright and holy that can obtain the evidences of the divine approval. God will not regard one who is living in wickedness as a righteous man, nor will he admit such a man to His favor here, or to His dwelling-place hereafter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. righteousness&#8212;the rewards which God bestows on His people, or the grace to secure those rewards as well as the result.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The blessing, </span> i.e. the blessings which God hath promised to his church and people, to wit, <span class="ital">grace and glory, and all other good things</span>, as they are summed up, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/84-11.htm" title="For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.">Psalm 84:11</a></span>.

The one rod, which the shepherd holds up to guide the flock, and upon which he leans and anxiously watches over the flock, has assumed a double form in the conception of the idea. This rod and staff in the hand of God comfort him, i.e., preserve to him the feeling of security, and therefore a cheerful spirit. Even when he passes through a valley dark and gloomy as the shadow of death, where surprises and calamities of every kind threaten him, he hears no misfortune. The lxx narrows the figure, rendering &#1489;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; according to the Aramaic &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837;. The noun &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, which occurs in this passage for the first time in the Old Testament literature, is originally not a compound word; but being formed from a verb &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, Arab. d&#817;lm (root &#1510;&#1500;, Arab. d&#817;l), to overshadow, darken, after the form &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, but pronounced &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (cf. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, Hadra-mo&#770;t  equals  the court of death, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; in-God's-shadow), it signifies the shadow of death as an epithet of the most fearful darkness, as of Hades, <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>., but also of a shaft of a mine, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>, and more especially of darkness such as makes itself felt in a wild, uninhabited desert, <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.<p>After the figure of the shepherd fades away in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, that of the host appears. His enemies must look quietly on (&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; as in <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>), without being able to do anything, and see how Jahve provides bountifully for His guest, anoints him with sweet perfumes as at a joyous and magnificent banquet (<a href="/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a>), and fills his cup to excess. What is meant thereby, is not necessarily only blessings of a spiritual kind. The king fleeing before Absolom and forsaken by the mass of his people was, with his army, even outwardly in danger of being destroyed by want; it is, therefore, even an abundance of daily bread streaming in upon them, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>, that is meant; but even this, spiritually regarded, as a gift from heaven, and so that the satisfying, refreshing and quickening is only the outside phase of simultaneous inward experiences.<p>(Note: In the mouth of the New Testament saint, especially on the dies viridium, it is the table of the Lord's supper, as Apollinaris also hints when he applied to it the epithet &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, horrendorum onustam.)<p>The future &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is followed, according to the customary return to the perfect ground-form, by &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, which has, none the less, the signification of a present. And in the closing assertion, &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;, my cup, is metonymically equivalent to the contents of my cup. This is &#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, a fulness satiating even to excess. </body></html>
