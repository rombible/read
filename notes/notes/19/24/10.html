We may also apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven, and the welcome given to him there. Our Redeemer found the gates of heaven shut, but having by his blood made atonement for sin, as one having authority, he demanded entrance. The angels were to worship him, Heb 1:6: they ask with wonder, Who is he? It is answered, that he is strong and mighty; mighty in battle to save his people, and to subdue his and their enemies. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into the souls of men by his word and Spirit, that they may be his temples. Behold, he stands at the door, and knocks, Rev 3:20. The gates and doors of the heart are to be opened to him, as possession is delivered to the rightful owner. We may apply it to his second coming with glorious power. Lord, open the everlasting door of our souls by thy grace, that we may now receive thee, and be wholly thine; and that, at length, we may be numbered with thy saints in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is this King of glory? - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>.<p>The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory - On the meaning of the phrase, "the Lord of hosts," see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>. The essential idea is, that God rules over the universe of worlds considered as marshalled in order, or arrayed as hosts or armies are for battle. All are under His command. The stars in the sky, that seem to be marshalled and led forth in such perfect and beautiful order - the inhabitants of heaven in their different orders and ranks - all these acknowledge Him, and submit to Him as the supreme God. In the close of the psalm, therefore, there is an exact accordance with the thought in the beginning, that God is the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, and that He should everywhere be recognized and regarded as such. The entrance of the ark of the covenant into the place provided for it as a permanent residence was a fit occasion to proclaim this thought; and this is proclaimed in the psalm in a manner befitting so solemn an occasion and so sublime a truth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

He claims to enter, not merely as a victorious warrior, but as the Sovereign of the Universe. The great title <span class="ital">Jehovah Tsebâôth</span> or <span class="ital">Lord of hosts</span>, which was characteristic of the regal and prophetic period, meets us here for the first time in the Psalter. Originally perhaps it designated Jehovah as “the God of the armies of Israel” (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm" title="Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.">1 Samuel 17:45</a>), who went forth with His people’s hosts to battle (<a href="/psalms/44-9.htm" title="But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.">Psalm 44:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm" title="I have not hid your righteousness within my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation: I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great congregation.">Psalm 40:10</a>), and whose Presence was the source of victory (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm" title="The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-11.htm" title="The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.">Psalm 46:11</a>). But as the phrase “host of heaven” was used for the celestial bodies (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.">Genesis 2:1</a>), and celestial beings (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>), the meaning of the title was enlarged to designate Jehovah as the ruler of the heavenly powers, the supreme Sovereign of the universe. Hence one of the renderings in the LXX is <span class="greekheb">κύριος παντοκράτωρ</span>, <span class="ital">Lord Almighty</span>, or rather, <span class="ital">All-sovereign</span>.

It has been generally recognized that the reception of the ark into the tabernacle on Mount Zion typified the entrance of our Lord into heaven after his ascension, whence our Church appoints this psalm as one of those to be recited on Ascension Day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jahve, whose throne of grace is now set upon Zion, has not a limited dominion, like the heathen deities: His right to sovereignty embraces the earth and its fulness (<a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12</a>), i.e., everything that is to be found upon it and in it.<p>(Note: In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm">1 Corinthians 10:26</a>, Paul founds on this verse (cf. <a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>) the doctrine that a Christian (apart from a charitable regard for the weak) may eat whatever is sold in the shambles, without troubling himself to enquire whether it has been offered to idols or not. A Talmudic teacher, B. Berachoth 35a, infers from this passage the duty of prayer before meat: He who eats without giving thanks is like one who lays hands upon &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (the sacred things of God); the right to eat is only obtained by prayer.)<p>For He, &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, is the owner of the world, because its Creator. He has founded it upon seas, i.e., the ocean and its streams, &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (<a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>); for the waters existed before the dry land, and this has been cast up out of them at God's word, so that consequently the solid land, - which indeed also conceals in its interior a &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), - rising above the surface of the sea, has the waters, as it were, for its foundation (<a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>), although it would more readily sink down into them than keep itself above them, if it were not in itself upheld by the creative power of God. Hereupon arises the question, who may ascend the mountain of Jahve, and stand above in His holy place? The futures have a potential signification: who can have courage to do it? what, therefore, must he be, whom Jahve receives into His fellowship, and with whose worship He is well-pleased? Answer: he must be one innocent in his actions and pure in mind, one who does not lift up his soul to that which is vain (&#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, according to the Masora with Waw minusculum).

The Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is old and acknowledged by the oldest authorities.<p>(Note: The reading &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is adopted by Saadia (in Enumoth ii., where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;), Juda ha-Levi (Cuzari iii. 27), Abulwalid (Rikma p. 180), Rashi, Kimchi, the Sohar, the Codices (and among others by that of the year 1294) and most editions (among which, the Complutensis has &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in the text). Nor does Aben-Ezra, whom Norzi has misunderstood, by any means reverse the relation of the Chethb and Ker; to him &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the Ker, and he explains it as a metaphor (an anthropomorphism): &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;. Elias Levita is the only one who rejects the Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but he does so though misunderstanding a Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130) and not without admitting Masoretic testimony in favour of it (&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1495;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;). He is the only textual critic who rejects it. For Jacob b. Chajim is merely astonished that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not to be found in the Masoreth register of words written with Waw and to be read with Jod. And even Norzi does not reject this Ker, which he is obliged to admit has greatly preponderating testimony in its favour, and he would only too gladly get rid of it.)<p>Even the lxx Cod. Alex. translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; whereas Cod. Vat. (Eus., Apollin., Theodor., et al.): &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Critically it is just as intangible, as it is exegetically incomprehensible; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might then be equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, an explanation, however, which does not seem possible even from <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. We let this Ker&#1502; alone to its undisturbed critical rights. But that the poet did actually write thus, is incredible.<p>In <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> (just as at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a>), in continued predicates, we are told the character of the man, who is worthy of this privilege, to whom the question in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> refers. Such an one shall bear away, or acquire (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, as e.g., <a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>) blessing from Jahve and righteousness from the God of his salvation (<a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>). Righteousness, i.e., conformity to God and that which is well-pleasing to God, appears here as a gift, and in this sense it is used interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>). It is the righteousness of God after which the righteous, but not the self-righteous, man hungers and thirsts; that moral perfection which is the likeness of God restored to him and at the same time brought about by his own endeavours; it is the being changed, or transfigured, into the image of the Holy One Himself. With <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> the answer to the question of <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> is at an end; <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> adds that those thus qualified, who may accordingly expect to receive God's gifts of salvation, are the true church of Jahve, the Israel of God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (lit., a revolution, Arabic dahr, root &#1491;&#1512;, to turn, revolve) is used here, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, of a collective whole, whose bond of union is not contemporaneousness, but similarity of disposition; and it is an alliteration with the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; (Chethb &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;, without the Jod plur.) which follows. &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is a second genitive depending on &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, as in <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>. Here at the close the predication passes into the form of invocation (Thy face). And &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is a summarising predicate: in short, these are Jacob, not merely after the flesh, but after the spirit, and thus in truth (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>, cf. <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). By interpolating &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, as is done in the lxx and Peshto, and adopted by Ewald, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher, the nerve, as it were, of the assertion is cut through. The predicate, which has been expressed in different ways, is concentrated intelligibly enough in the one word &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, towards which it all along tends. And here the music becomes forte. The first part of this double Psalm dies away amidst the playing of the instruments of the Levitical priests; for the Ark was brought in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) is to be read. </body></html>
